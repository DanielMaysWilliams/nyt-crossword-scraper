It's the kind of leg cramp when you're sleeping on it the wrong way and you wake up and feel a piercing pain in your calf muscles, and don't have any idea where that came from.  You tell yourself, turn over gently and slowly relax your muscle.  It calms down, you wait about five minutes in place, and you hope that when you try to stand up, it doesn't come roaring back.  (You can also get a Charley horse from strenuous activity, but the in-bed kind are the cruelest.)\n\nStomach cramps, for example, are never Charley horses.","createDate":"1750083601","updateDate":"1750121532","approveDate":"1750083602","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142873484,"parentUserDisplayName":"Petrol","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142879303","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5359448790550232}
