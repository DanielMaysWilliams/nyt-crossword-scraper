Three grid spanning stacks with a funky looking grid that virtually isolated the three sections made it seem almost like three separate puzzles.  I got the middle section first by knowing about Katherine Hepburn’s OSCARNOMINATIONS and about SPANISHOMELETTEs.  I got the bottom section almost as easily by knowing HOTELCALIFORNIA, which gave me enough letters to get enough downs to see the other spanners (although I did try to find a way to work Yankees into the Berra DiMaggio clue before ITALIANAMERICANS came to me).  But I whiffed badly on the top section.  All I could think of for 1A was ablewasiereisawelba, which made no sense for the downs and caused me no end of grief.  For some reason the equally well known AMANAPLANACANALpanama would not come to me, until I started over, got NARC and guessed that ACCRA was the African art center. Lovely puzzle.\n\nI’m a big  admirer of Katherine Hepburn, but perhaps her biggest fan was my first wife.  Like Hepburn, my wife was a Bryn Mawrter, and she got to meet her idol once at a college function. In the course of the evening, Hepburn handed my wife an empty, clear plastic cup that had contained the beverage she was drinking.  Rather than disposing of the cup, as had been expected, she kept the cup and it stayed with us through several moves, as if it were a holy grail, until it finally cracked and fell apart.

I wonder if enough data exists to assess the validity of this conjecture?\n\nThere are 15 rows in the grid. Fill in the triple stacks and you've already filled 9/15 = 60% of the *entire* 15 x 15 grid. In this puzzle, there were two grid-spanning rows of black squares (jiggled a bit, so not quite horizontal). So, once you've filled in the triple stacks, you've actually completed 9/13 (about 70%) of the entire puzzle.\n\nPerhaps with more difficult cluing of the spanners a puzzle using this grid would feel more like a Saturday puzzle (to me).","createDate":"1737213544","updateDate":"1737232728","approveDate":"1737213545","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139090204,"parentUserDisplayName":"Oikofuge","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139092971","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7524142861366272}
