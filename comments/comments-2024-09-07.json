So far so good. But the problem of translating that tension between \"inflection\" (intended meaning) and \"innuendo\" (unintended meaning) into a puzzle is probably what's turning people off: solvers tend to be people who derive pleasure out of finding the singular solution to a problem, whereas poetry -- and especially Stevens' -- encourages readers to derive many meanings and readings. Solvers by their nature probably don't care for that much. \n\nI can see how this puzzle is meaty enough to handle various \"readings\" of it, but like you, Steve, I'm not doing it.","createDate":"1725711550","updateDate":"1725882730","approveDate":"1725711554","recommendations":28,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136008327","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5170329809188843}

Where's the middle ground? While I do take issue with certain clues or answers, I rarely find an entire puzzle to be worthy of rebuke.  There was \"some obscure\" trivia today (which I'm not thrilled by), but not any more than usual.  And there were some clues that didn't quite work as well as they should (like \"family inheritance?\" for GENEPOOL), but not more than one or two.  That kind of clue is my particular bugaboo.  I love, love, love clever wordplay, but I am disappointed when the \"clever wordplay\" doesn't quite work.\n\nI enjoy a difficult puzzle, but not at the expense the clues/answers working well together.  A few tough puzzles in the past few months had this problem.  They were tough not because of well constructed and clever clues, but because the answers didn't really work well enough with the clue (IMO).\n\nThis puzzle was light on wordplay (so not my fave), and the grid geometry made it more like a grouping of mini-puzzles (one in each corner plus the middle), but overall it seemed like a very traditional \"more difficult\" puzzle.  The reason it was tricky was because many of the clues were not obvious and one really needed to work the crosses to figure it out.  I thought that would please the traditionalists.","createDate":"1725723630","updateDate":"1725766998","approveDate":"1725723633","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136012224","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-07","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5781758427619934}

Most of that difficulty in this era is due to clever cluing.  For example, right off the bat 1A makes you think of \"labor\" in the sense of workers and employers, and you come up with things like strike, (wage) freeze, etc.  But words have more than one meaning (polysemy!), and here you have to think of the labor of childbirth.\n\nIn the same corner, \"iris\" can be part of the eye, or a flower, or even a goddess.  \"Whizzes\" can be aces or a verb denoting speed.  \n\nThe puzzle is loaded with polysemy like that.  Tesla could be the man or the car.  A \"sausage grinder\" can be a sandwich in Boston or a machine or, in this case, a tooth.  \"High\" can relate to physical position, metaphysical position, or even, as it is here, being intoxicated.  \"Drill\" can be a noun or a verb; as a noun, it can be a machine or a practice.  As a verb, it can relate to either noun meaning.  \n\nOnce you start to look for polysemy in the clues, you won't get stuck as much.  And you'll see that the fault lies not in the puzzle, dear Laura...","createDate":"1725720281","updateDate":"1725851806","approveDate":"1725720285","recommendations":25,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136009746,"parentUserDisplayName":"Laura Stratton","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136010785","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-07","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5543712377548218}

Is that right?  I've never shared any pirated material, so I don't know these things.\n\nI forgot to look at what the answer to the MI?/?ONGLE cross is.  I had MEH, of course, for \"mediocre in modern slang\" as I'm sure all the rest of you did, but I couldn't make it work with ICONIC.  Which has to be correct, yes?  So I changed to MI-something-or-other.  \n\nAnd then I ran the alphabet 4 or 5 times to try to come up with a \"computer accessory\" ?ONGLE.  I'm pretty sure the crosses are right, though it could be ?ONKLE if it's SUMO RINK rather than SUMO RING.  As you know, I have no superfluous gadgets in my house, but you'd think I'd at least have heard of that mysterious computer accessory.  I can't even make a guess at that missing crossing letter.\n\nBecause of all the very, very, very new slanguage that populates the NYTXW,  I thought that sOOFUS might actually be a new epithet for a stupid person.  Only belatedly did I think to change sALLY for \"move slowly\" to DALLY.  So only one missing letter now.
