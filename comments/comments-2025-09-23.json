Poland was one of the strongest regional powers in Eastern Europe in the 16th century, but rapid decline as a result of wars, famine and egoism of its nobles in the 17th and 18th centuries led to its disappearance from the map in the 1790s, when Poland was partitioned by its more powerful and aggressive neighbors: Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The defeat of Germany (successor to Prussia) and Austria-Hungary (successor to Austria) in WW1, and Russia's descent into revolution allowed Poland's resurrection, with American support offered by Woodrow Wilson. November 11 is our biggest national holiday.\n\nWe don't have a holiday for veterans, specifically.

I'll admit that the \"A\" is not an initial letter, but that \"rule\" is broken so often that I think most people would still consider it an acronym. NOLA also is pronounceable as a word, which is another traditional characteristic of acronyms, even though many people don't distinguish between acronyms and initialisms anymore. And the reason people break the initial letter rule is usually because the _want_ it to be an acronym in the sense of it being a pronounceable abbreviation.\n\nAnyway, call it an abbreviation, if you will. My point is that standard practice in the NYT crossword is that if an answer is an abbreviation, there must be an abbreviation in the clue, or the clue must allude to it somehow, for example by appending \"for short\".

Here's the poem:\n\nThe Abnormal Is Not Courage\n\nThe Poles rode out from Warsaw against the German\nTanks on horses. Rode knowing, in sunlight, with sabers,\nA magnitude of beauty that allows me no peace.\nAnd yet this poem would lessen that day. Question\nThe bravery. Say it’s not courage. Call it a passion.\nWould say courage isn’t that. Not at its best.\nIt was impossib1e, and with form. They rode in sunlight,\nWere mangled. But I say courage is not the abnormal.\nNot the marvelous act. Not Macbeth with fine speeches.\nThe worthless can manage in public, or for the moment.\nIt is too near the whore’s heart: the bounty of impulse,\nAnd the failure to sustain even small kindness.\nNot the marvelous act, but the evident conclusion of being.\nNot strangeness, but a leap forward of the same quality.\nAccomplishment. The even loyalty. But fresh.\nNot the Prodigal Son, nor Faustus. But Penelope.\nThe thing steady and clear. Then the crescendo.\nThe real form. The culmination. And the exceeding.\nNot the surprise. The amazed understanding. The marriage,\nNot the month’s rapture. Not the exception. The beauty\nThat is of many days. Steady and clear.\nIt is the normal excellence, of long accomplishment.","createDate":"1758626773","updateDate":"1758677957","approveDate":"1758626774","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145195622,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145198293","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.771517813205719}
