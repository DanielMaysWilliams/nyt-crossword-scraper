Oh, Deb’s job has been to explain the theme and tricky clues, and she has done that skillfully.  That’s all she’s really had to do, but she’s gone – day after day – the extra mile.\n\nYou know you’re going to feel good reading Deb. She touches such a lovely place in the heart, makes it go ahhh and smile.  Part of it is how genuine she is – she’s never trying to impress.  No, she’s wanting to help, wanting to share when a funny thought hits her.  Rooting for the new solvers while at the same time making observations that experienced solvers can relate to.\n\nLots of specifics for why Deb is special, but to me it’s mainly the je ne sais quoi, the magic. She has a talent for that, and I’m so grateful for it.  What a gift you’ve been to the Times and to us all.

The black squares are vacuums, places of nothingness, primordial chaos! How can there be letters hiding in there?

I was referring to the 15x15 crossword. I have a student subscription, but it’s shouldn’t be due to expire for a good bit longer. I did Wednesday’s on Tuesday night and opened the app this morning to find the crossword unavailable and telling me to buy a games subscription. Opening it on my computer gave the same message. Unfortunately I have not been able to figure out what changed between Tuesday and today.","createDate":"1766100967","updateDate":"1766102029","approveDate":"1766100968","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147409757,"parentUserDisplayName":"Blue","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147410802","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7755287289619446}
