Every previous year had been a failure.  Two commentators challenged me to follow through this time and would join in the effort.  No pressure, heh, heh.\n\nJanuary went fine.  Then I discovered that the text of a play that I thought I knew well began with a prologue or Induction that I had never before encountered despite seeing several film, TV, and video performances.  That's how The Taming of the Shrew became February's project.\n\nI.  Some observations on the difficulty of reading one of the plays:\n\n1.  The text is inert.  A performance is brought to life by the Director's vision and the actors' delivery. Whether a line is spoken litteraly or tongue-in-cheek is a matter of interpretation.  That's up for the reader to decide.  Shakespeare often complicates this with liberal use of puns and double entendre. \n2.  Shakespeare is fond of disguise, impersonation, and assumed names.  Actors' physical attributes make it easier to know Gremio from Grumio; or Lucentio as Cambio; and Tranio as Lucentio.\n3.  Shakespeare's language.  Here is the very first line :  \n\tSLY:  I'll feeeze you, in faith.\n \tHOSTESS:  A pair of stocks, you rogue. \nThe drunkard Sly has broken two glasses and threatens to \"do for, fix, or settle the hash of\" the Hostess.\n\nI'll deal with the problems of historical and social norms later.","createDate":"1709086267","updateDate":"1709137773","approveDate":"1709086269","recommendations":3,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131471714","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6372169852256775}

The pungent smell of stinky tofu isn’t spicy but pervades (overloads?) your senses in the same way as the cayenne. It is one of the most common smells at a street market in China. I’ve had ‘never again’ versions and ‘not bad’ versions and some that were actually quite tasty — some people will tell you it, it doesn’t taste like it smells and that is definitely true depending on the chef. \n\nHere’s a really good article:\n\n<a href=\"https://roadsandkingdoms.com/2019/stinky-tofu-in-shaoxing\" target=\"_blank\">https://roadsandkingdoms.com/2019/stinky-tofu-in-shaoxing</a>/","createDate":"1709019396","updateDate":"1709138159","approveDate":"1709019398","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131445358,"parentUserDisplayName":"Janine","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131446197","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-27","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5781374573707581}

It's not that they're intrinsically different, but rather they just may play a little harder on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n\nThe difference between Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and between Wednesdays and Thursdays is considerably greater (at least for me), but there's just a slight increase again between Thursdays and Fridays, as we go from tricky to themeless.  The jump between Fridays and Saturdays is again more substantial (four minutes), and there's another substantial jump from Saturdays to Sundays, but of course this is because of the size, not the difficulty level.","createDate":"1709040604","updateDate":"1709061597","approveDate":"1709040606","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131448389,"parentUserDisplayName":"Chrisinroch","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131449433","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7523046135902405}

Historical context and social norms.\nThe Taming of the Shrew first appeared in print in the First Folio of 1623.  Britannica.com estimates that it was originally written and performed between 1590 and 1594.\n\nThe medieval view was of a divinely ordered universe consisting of a Great Chain of Being. From God and Angels to humans, beasts, plants, and minerals with each group into hierarchies.  As a King ruled his noble lords and the lords ruled the people, so the husband ruled the family.\n\nFamilies were an important part of the social order.  The power and influence of the family name was determined by the land, wealth, and affinities possessed by the head of the family.  The custom of primogeniture and legal entails were to preserve that power over generations.  Marriage was a means of adding to a family's power and prestige. \nThe medieval model came under stress with the renewed study of Classical learning and a growing middle class based on trade and economic wealth.  Henry VIII (1509-1547) reigned over a Renaissance court and his dynastic ambition led to the split of the Church of England from Rome while Luther and others were leading the Reformation elsewhere.\nShakespeare's audience would have already been ruled by Queens Mary I (1553-1558) and Elizabeth I (1558-1603).\n\nThere would be no women on stage.  It was against the law. \n\nPart 3 will address the main themes and a few key scenes.","createDate":"1709087215","updateDate":"1709123978","approveDate":"1709087219","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131471714,"parentUserDisplayName":"Al  in Pittsburgh","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131472136","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9440982937812805}
