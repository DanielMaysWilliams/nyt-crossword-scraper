If you weren’t part of the Norse clique, you weren’t going to understand that Haki was a sea king, therefore the sea was his road. Or that waves breaking into foam—white horses, the Brits call them—looked like mountains of swans. Gorgeous imagery. \n\nKJALAR, by the way, is the genitive of kjǫlr, same root as our KEEL. \n\nBut why didn’t the Vikings just say what they meant?

A few weeks later mysterious photos appeared on my iPad, which was linked to my iPhone. It took very little effort to identify the thief, as she posted photos showing her workplace and name badge amongst other things.  Google gave us everything about her via Facebook. She was arrested and cautioned. The sting in the tail for her? She’d also uploaded a lot of, ahem, intimate pics of herself. It was pointed out to her that said pics were my property on my phone and if I wished to show them to the public at large I was perfectly entitled to do so.

Of course not. It's just a tool that makes your work faster and easier.\n\nWhen calculators first came out, people worried that kids would no longer do simple math in their heads.  Of course, there were always people who couldn't do simple math in their heads. But the calculator wasn't the end of civilization, and it allowed the teaching of more advanced concepts with less rote learning.\n\nThe phone in your pocket is similarly a tool; in fact, it's the Swiss army knife of electronics. When I was a kid, who would have imagined you could have in one small pocket-sized device a phone, that calculator, a compass, a tape recorder, a telegraph (texting), mail, maps and directions, a radio, a TV, a newspaper, a pedometer, your credit cards and event tickets, a universal translator like you saw on Star Trek, your banking, a dictionary, books to read, shopping, games, and best of all, that library at Alexandria called the internet...plus so many other functions you couldn't have even predicted back then (word processing, spreadsheets, presentation apps, etc.)\n\nAnd of course, the socials. (I only have LinkedIn, which I don't really even use, anyway)\n\nAll of these things are tools.
