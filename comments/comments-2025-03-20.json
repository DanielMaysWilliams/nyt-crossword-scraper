Here, try coming up with a clue that works with FISH and FIST, and sounds natural for both.  Take a moment, give it a stab.  \n\nIt can be a challenge, no?  (Here‚Äôs how constructor Andrew Reynolds clued them in a puzzle a year ago: ‚ÄúIt may be landed with a hook‚Äù.)\n\nTrust me, the Times team are sticklers about this.  If it sounds strained, they will not publish it.  And today, Daniel passed that bar eight times.  \n\nThat is impressive enough, but other difficult elements ‚Äì such as the layer involving the ‚Äú_or_‚Äù words (like HORA) and the requirements of symmetry ‚Äì made this puzzle‚Äôs build a very tall hill to climb.

The solver is actually given a choice, if so desired (even when one catches on that it's a Schr√∂dinger.) \n\nIn my case, I went another route, but a viable one as well.
