First to the column by Deb: as a word-loving dad who has a couple word-loving children, nothing makes such a parent prouder and happier than to share word-loving like that, and even better if you know they're going to be OK, as you put it, so good on you for contributing in some alchemical way to increasing the time he remained alive: you (and the rest of his family) made his life that much more worth living a little longer. You can see that pride and joy in other word-loving parents, too, like when Strudel Dad comments, or, back in the day when Rachel's Mom would stop by once in a while.\n\nTo the puzzle: a lot of fun, thoroughly witty and modern, very 21st century but with a dash of Wodehouse to it. For too long I had LOCUST for CICADA. (Are you a Ci-CAY-duh person or a Ci-CAH-da sort? I'm the former, my wife the latter.) But I also put down SHIPLASH, \n\nI sorta hoped that end letters to the themers would have spelled some word, the kind of extra feature that cause some of us to go insane on this chatline, but all it spelt out was MECATELT. \n\nAlso liked the clandestine OPTICAL common core of this puzzle, with its SPYING through a PEEPHOLE, and what do you see? Some model named Edna giving herself a steely, leery look into the mirror as she applies primer? Or Trent Reznor at home, getting riled into spasms by the presence of an oboe in the theme song to \"The Queen's Gambit\" which he's about to watch, while having consommé and a nice, dry Rhone?","createDate":"1737002579","updateDate":"1737088989","approveDate":"1737002580","recommendations":33,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139032210","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9485698342323303}

Your tribute to your dad is so lovely and honest. It's hard to carry the regrets of time and opportunities lost.\n\nMy dad died when he was 46, and I will always regret our last parting. He was standing in the driveway to say goodbye. It occurred to me to give him a hug (not a thing we were big on) and say \"I love you,\" but I was 18 and cool older friends were in the car waiting for me, so I just ran past him with a quick wave and headed back to college, never expecting that I'd never see him again.\n\nHe was a good man but not an easy man; there were a lot of demons there, but I so very much wish I'd have done better.\n\nIt taught me that while I can't change that day, I can do my absolute best to ensure no one else I love dies without knowing I love them. I've learned that grief is love that doesn't quite know where to go... that it's not a thing to get over but, once it's not quite as acute, to make room for and to feel the love.\n\nI hope you'll be easy on yourself about your regrets. Your dad sounds like he would admire feistiness, so I've no doubt he was actually very proud of you for the strong person you are, despite the conflicts—as much as he was proud of you for your crossword success. I'm so happy for the warm times you had together and that you brought him such comfort in the end.

I’m so sorry for your loss, but having gone through almost exactly what you went through- a few years prior- I can empathize (down to holding hands until very end).  However, unlike your father who gave you the gift of crossword joy, my father (for still some unfathomable reason) did not care for crosswords.  Anytime I would shout out a clue I didn’t know, but thought for sure he would know, I’d get either an answer, a question as to why I wasn’t solving the thing by myself, or both.  What made this all the more mysterious to me as to why he didn’t seem to enjoy crossword puzzles was this was the very man who instilled in me a love of words and literature and the power of knowledge (and many other invaluable lessons and incredible memories of what it means to be a loving and caring parent).
