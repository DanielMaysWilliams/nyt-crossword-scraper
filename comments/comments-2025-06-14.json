Say I wrote an algorithm that ignored the clues entirely and instead tried every possible combination of letters across the entire grid? It’s technically feasible. Would it make me a good crossword puzzler? Does trying a series of combinations make me a good safe-cracker?\n\nA good test for a fair puzzle is imagining how you’d feel solving with pen and paper. Would you look at TENREC and feel happily confident you’d learned a new word — because even though it wasn’t in your vocabulary, it was the _only_ possible entry that could fit all the clues? Or, without the app to play its little tune, would you have to wait for the solution to see whether your gamble — educated, maybe, but still a stab — happened to be a winner?\n\nI’ve posted this on here before, but a construction that relies on proper names is unfair by nature (those are quiz show questions, not puzzles), and only careful selection of crosses, clever cluing, and a good edit can change that.

I’d think the average American solver who doesn’t follow British or other non-US politics would tend to think of someone sitting in the House of Lords (if they ever were to think of one, to begin with) generically as a “British legislator” or “British lawmaker”; an American solver who does follow other countries’ politics enough to have “MP” (not standing for “military police” or “magic/mana points”) as a familiar term in their head, by contrast, would tend to know that the term is, in practice, used only for members of the lower house, the Commons. This is, in fact, consistent across parliamentary systems: A Canadian or Australian “MP” is a member of the federal-level House of Commons or House of Representatives, respectively, not the Canadian or Australian Senate.\n\nSure, one could argue that someone who sits in the upper chamber in Westminster is, in a strictly literal sense, a “member of the UK’s parliament,” but a) that still doesn’t quite get to the specific abbreviation “MP,” and b) I would have to ask if you wouldn’t find something off about, say, [Bernie Sanders since 2007, for example] solving to CONGRESSMAN.","createDate":"1749918354","updateDate":"1749973453","approveDate":"1749918354","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142843746,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ιασων","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142849041","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7677803039550781}

I would normally err on the side of taking these terms hyper-literally — i.e., Lords are indeed members of parliament; and U.S. senators, as people who are part of Congress, are congresspeople. And it bothers me that this isn’t common usage, but the fact is that it isn’t. No one refers to Senators as congressmen, and Lords are very purposely referred to as *Lords* of Parliament to distinguish them from mere *Members.*\n\nAs I said, though, it’s established usage, but it’s ugly. The fact that House representatives go by “congressperson” but senators don’t is why some people think that a bill “passed by Congress” may still need the Senate’s approval, as if they were completely separate bodies. The general public’s handle on civic matters is tenuous enough as is, and imprecise nomenclature makes it worse. \n\nBut that’s just the way things are. Groaning that Lords are technically members of the institution called Parliament, or that Senators are people who belong to Congress, is as futile as insisting that Quebecois are technically “Latin Americans” (a term coined by the French to contrast the broader Romance-speaking New World with the Anglo-Saxon colonies).","createDate":"1749936583","updateDate":"1749973521","approveDate":"1749936583","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142849041,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ιασων","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142852299","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5262895226478577}
