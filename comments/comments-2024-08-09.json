Dash it, I'm going down right now to get me one (blackberry preserves and Skippy on whitebread)! \n\nWorking among indie rockers, who remind me sometimes of Lubavitcher jews in the purity of their orthodoxy, I've learned that bands like the Black Keys & White Stripes might start off as indie, but if they sign to commercial labels and start putting out songs played on commercial radio, or which sound like they should be on commercial radio, they're no longer indie. Just as Judaism is both a culture and a religion, so indie rock is both a kind of sound, content, technique and production values of the music itself, and also about the lifestyle choices and financial & business considerations the rockers make. My colleagues would certainly speak in SNIDE TONES about the Keys and the Stripes.

He averages a bit over eight Times answer debuts per puzzle.  Today he had 10, including such lovely additions to the oeuvre as GO OUT ON TOP, I MISSED YOU, KINKSHAME, and LET ME EXPLAIN.\n\nIn addition, he has the cluing knack, peppering his puzzles with original beauties.

My experience was mixed. For about 3/4 of it, I thought I'd have a personal best for Friday. But then I came to a screeching halt. Everything north of TULSA (a gimme for me) at 38A was really hard won. So basically, that section took me more time than the rest of the puzzle did. \n\nBut when I got it all in (without any help), I felt extremely happy and accomplished! And so I give myself a customary, HUZZAH!!!!\n\nDoes it matter that so many others found it really easy? I don't know, I know that my experience was similar for much of the puzzle, and I know I couldn't have done this without help six months ago. I know there are competitions out there but I'm only competing against myself, so it's all good! \n\nHaving A grades and strata instead of APLUSES and BTEAMS really set me back so in and out they went. I did have TONES, SNIDE and MIST but had a hard time with crosses. The E instead of o in IDOLATERS threw me a bit. And I was thinking along the lines of impatience for toe tapping. Victory when I finally remembered SPIN, which gave me P in IMPOSSIBLE, which helped me settle on UM NO, instead of debating Uh, oh, etc. And from there it fell. BERGS was last and made me laugh when I got it! Nice!!\n\nFavorites: KNOT and IDOS next to each other, SOBER, MAYI, and ANTE.\n\nAlso, KINK SHAME because I didn't know that phase and TULSA because too many don't know about it.\n\nCheers to the weekend! üòä","createDate":"1723228617","updateDate":"1723309911","approveDate":"1723228620","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135332006","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.46073096990585327}

I knew the answer almost instantly, even though I was born in 1980, because of the technological backwardness of \"communist\" Poland in the 80s. Fax machines were unknown, so telex was actually considered modern technology - along with telegrams. Then came the political and economic transformation of 1989. Along with market economy and democracy came the fax machine, which enjoyed a short career in the early and mid-90s, to be rather quickly displaced by the internet, which was introduced commercially pretty much at the same time as everywhere else, but suffered initially because of inferior infrastructure. These days though we enjoy services provided over fiber optic cables and 5G wireless technology. Quite the leap.\n\n(But we have some the worst postal services in Europe, and possibly in the world. In the 90s and 00s it was not unusual for a letter to travel 2 weeks from one end of Warsaw to the other.

(For some reason autocorrect keeps putting in \"cheese molested\" instead of \"and completed\".)\n\nNot really sure what the Wordplay columnist was thinking.  This was one of the easiest, \"smoothest\" of recent entries, although of a similar trend overall in descending difficulty.  As others have theorized, we went through a period in the temporary Fagliano era where the puzzles were KILLERS and perhaps we are now in an overcompensated period?  I'm really interested to see what happens when Shortz returns.\n\nCarry on; the clue for the dreaded \"ante\" was probably the best ever, in a sad field.  :)","createDate":"1723174963","updateDate":"1723231046","approveDate":"1723174965","recommendations":5,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135313523","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-09","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7170384526252747}
