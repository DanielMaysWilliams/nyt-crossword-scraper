So the answer to  [There's the rub!], for instance, which has appeared in the Times puzzle twice, is SPA, and that's what \"there\" refers to (a rub is another word for a massage).\n\nIn [Call me!], the \"me\" refers to the cab.\n\nThe clue is often a phrase that normally has nothing to do with the answer, and seeing it in its new light is meant to bring a smile.  [Call me!] certainly did that for me.","createDate":"1715017663","updateDate":"1715135405","approveDate":"1715017665","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133020953,"parentUserDisplayName":"_chs_","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133027557","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7780594229698181}
