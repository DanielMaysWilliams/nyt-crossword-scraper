Thank you. The editors should have helped you with this, but the word used to describe Brendan Fraser’s character is considered a slur despite still being used as a medical term and is harmful to include in this context.\n\nThe editors have somewhat pathetically been edgelording around this term recently—egregiously allowing its use to describe Jabba the Hutt, a monstrous amalgamation of all hateful fat stereotypes. \n\nThen, after criticism of that use, the next clue for this word pointed out its inaccuracy as a medical term—the clue there was something about how George Clooney and Brad Pitt are both technically accurately described by this term according to their BMI.  An improvement, perhaps, but still trolling—finding a way to slur with the cover of “well it’s a medical term.”\n\nIf any other group of people were to say, this is a hateful slur to us, please stop using it, most people and the NYT would certainly comply. \n\nIt’s not that hard to sub in any oppressed group of people you actually care about to see how inappropriate it is to include a slur in the crossword. I recommend trying it. \n\nThe crossword should be a safe, fun space for all.","createDate":"1721924017","updateDate":"1724278412","approveDate":"1721924021","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134962156","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.4832632839679718}
