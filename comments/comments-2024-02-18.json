Just consider what you'd be saying if you had ACE/ATTAR and the given solution were ice/ittar.\n\nFirst. consider ATTAR vs. ittar. ATTAR is the normal English word for it; see this Ngram comparing the two:\n\n<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2s4yr4tb\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/2s4yr4tb</a>\n\nNote that ATTAR completely dominates ittar, by about 30-1.  Ittar hardly even registers.  \n\nIt also out-Googles ittar by about 40,000,000 to 1,000,000; most of the first few pages of ittar show foreign sources or actually use ATTAR.  When you Google \"ittar definition -attar\", your hits go down to a few thousand.\n\nSo yes, it's a thing, but it's not common enough to expect to see it in a crossword.\n\nNow, let's look at ACE/ice.  ACE fits the definition perfectly, because an ACE in tennis is a delivery (serve) that cannot be returned. You just have to know a little about tennis to get this.  \n\nIce, on the other hand, is rarely delivered anymore, but if it is, and it's still frozen and packaged (I assume bagged ice these days), I don't see why it couldn't be returned. To chose \"ice\" as your answer is a stretch, one you would only make if you didn't see another alternative.  \n\nIn the case of both words, a much better alternative was there. New solvers should commit both to memory, because they'll come up again frequently. ATTAR 313 times; ittar none. ACE, at 968 times, is clued via tennis about once or twice a year; ice has never been clued by \"delivery\".","createDate":"1708263318","updateDate":"1708943396","approveDate":"1708263320","recommendations":23,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131250462","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6787148118019104}

Welch's had deemed their sugar content too low for their juice products, and cancelled the harvest.
