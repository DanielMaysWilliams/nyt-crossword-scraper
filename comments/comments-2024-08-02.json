I found it to be challenging, although in the end, my solve time was seconds faster than my average...but of course, my average has been steadily improving over the years.  These days, I expect every solve to be below my average, because my average on this site goes back about 10 years, when I was already a veteran solver, but not as fast as I am now.\n\nAnyway, what made this puzzle tough for me was the vagueness of many of the clues.  From the start, [Carrier letters] made me think of packages first, not aircraft.  I sat on  [Server's question after a drink order] despite having most of the letters before I saw IS PEPSI OK; Coke and its various products are always preferable to Pepsi, although I'd grudgingly accept the latter if I had to.  It's very much in the language, for sure.\n\n[Took off, as a cap] had me thinking headwear, not bottle tops at first.  I didn't know TAI, although I'm familiar with Thai.

Sports clues are always tough for me, and I had some mistakes in the across fill (like tATTY in place of RATTY) that slowed me down. “Testament to human nature” was one of very many brilliant clues. Another favorite was “Half a train?” for CHOO. Thanks for a challenging puzzle, Ms. Park.

I am not saying my perspective is “right,” but there comes a point in solving a puzzle in which the creator seems far more inclined toward self-congratulatory obscurity than creating a puzzle that is a delight to be shared by creator and solver.  I hated this puzzle.  It truly felt as if the creator wanted to be able to justify every obscurity, rather than to make its creation a solution a shared sequence of aha! pleasures.  And since a drink server could be a bartender, a flight attendant, a sommelier, a barista, or John Belushi, NONE of whom would have said anything like that, I just hope the Times puzzle staff can distinguish between those puzzles that offer shared pleasure — like a well-crafted mystery — and those in which a creator pursues RATTY obscurity with a righteous sense of “I can justify it so stop griping.”  Indeed.  If I see this creator’s authorship on any future puzzle, I will skip it.  A well crafted puzzle should inspire a grin of pleasure, not such a cumulative sense of irritation that I invest 1,308 characters in underscoring the stark difference between a great puzzle and one that feels like an obscurist’s ego trip.","createDate":"1722649288","updateDate":"1722992365","approveDate":"1722649292","recommendations":4,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135167571","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-02","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.764456570148468}
