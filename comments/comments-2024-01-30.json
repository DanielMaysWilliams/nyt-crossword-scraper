It's Tuesday, but the cluing is quite imaginative in many places: NEIGH, ECHO; GNU; OCTET; ALOHAS; EGGS; BAIL; and especially COIN.  I've always worried that if I come up with a theme that's \"only\" Tuesday-level, my clues will be dumbed down, so I try to come up with themes that are definitely late-week candidates.

Its growth habitat created huge and beautiful cathedral-like canopies.  \n\nBeginning in the 1930s , Dutch Elm Disease wiped out virtually all these trees.  Some disease resistant varies survive, and scientists are trying to help them stage a come back.  Uncertain if it will work.   \n\nAlso, in the 1760s an elm tree on the Common in Boston became famous as a rallying place for colonists challenging British rule.  They named it the Liberty Tree.   Just before the war, Loyalists  to the Crown chopped the Liberty Tree down, but its spirit lived on.
