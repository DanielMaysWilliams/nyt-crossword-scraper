Star witness. Hah!\n\nI kind of wish Henry Ford had not been included in this pantheon. I've just been reading about his very vocal anti-semitism; he started a newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, in which he not only published \"The International Jew\" and promoted the spurious Protocols of the Elders of Zion, but also penned really vicious diatribes against Jews. I had thought his promotion of square dancing to be a charming side of his complex character, but it turns out that he hated jazz music and publicly reviled it as leading to moral decay and as a secret plot of Jewish music impresarios and producers to corrupt American morals, actively promoting square dancing as a wholesome alternative. When I asked my 93 year old father why he bought Fords over the years when he knew all this about Henry (he was a historian and knew stuff), he replied \"The schmuck was long dead by the time I bought my first car, what do I care what he was? A car's a car.\" \n\nIn 1927 Henry Ford shut down the Dearborn Independent and issued a public apology, recanting his views about Jews, under financial pressure because of slow sales resulting from the shaky rollout of the Model A and societal pressure from the effects of boycotts and international criticism. But his apology was considered insincere by the press and Jewish organizations, and boycotts continued, especially when his German sympathies resurfaced in the 1930s.","createDate":"1765066800","updateDate":"1765191396","approveDate":"1765066801","recommendations":61,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147124893","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.40582510828971863}

Apologies in advance for the sport-specific pedantry, but this is just wrong. In the climber’s lexicon *and in the dictionary* (Merriam was the one the internet gave me), the crag is the entire cliff face. I found no dictionary entry supporting the meaning given in the clue. There is a detailed lexicon in climber speak that differentiates the many kinds of handholds and how to use them (crimp, sloper, jug, pinch, etc., too many to list). This is probably too inside baseball for a good Sunday fill, but the clue with this fill could have been made accurate by changing one word in the clue to “rock climber’s playground” or something without going too deep in the weeds for a sport that pretty much everyone from Hollywood to the news to now the NYT crossword gets wrong.","createDate":"1765130546","updateDate":"1765180400","approveDate":"1765130547","recommendations":23,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147134883","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.885353147983551}
