We are renting a smart home—which wasn’t my first choice but here we are—and so we’re plagued by (to me) random advice and admonishments from a disembodied voice which doesn’t always respond to my, “Not now, Google; shut up!”  This morning, as I was brewing the coffee, Google announced that the freezing fog we were experiencing would be, “deposited, leading to rime on roads. Use caution.”  Huh, I thought and said, “Hey Google, did you just wax poetic and say, ‘rime?’” Google waited a beat, then said brightly, “The laundry is finished. Please unload the laundry.”\n\nThat was the end of our witty banter, but all day I kept bugging my husband to go for a drive on the “roads covered in rime. Rime!” My husband has a wordless look for times like these. “But honey,” I said, “It’s rime! We now live in a place where rime has left the literary realm and become a reality I can drive over!” (I have used a lot of exclamation points today.) My husband gave me another look and said that Google had announced rime many times over the past year but I never paid any attention. Also, that there was rime covering spider webs on the lawn furniture and the one hanging right outside the kitchen window in front of which I’d ground the beans just minutes earlier.\n\nWell, he can’t spoil my joy. 40-odd years in this planet’s high desert regions had never brought rime to my daily vocabulary.

It's more than 100 years old (was in our 2007 house when we bought it), the oak tank stripped down to the beautiful wood that was under multiple coats of paint, and relined with copper, the super-high-quality porcelain bowl still glisteningly, perfectly white, and the seat replaced. \n\nWhy the high tank toilet style was abandoned I will never understand.  Gravity means it uses less water, and it never fails to do what it was meant to do.\n\nYou can find lesser restored antiques online  for +$1K.
