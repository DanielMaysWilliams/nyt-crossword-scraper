The problem is that once you notice the repetitive nature of the theme entries—which is pretty obvious right away once you get a couple of Gs on the downs in the first themer—you can imagine that the other long entries are also repetitive even if you don’t get the theme right away, so half the puzzle is filled in with almost no work at all. And with only three themers and no revealer, there’s no real Aha moment while solving. The fill was decent but the clueing was also pretty straightforward for a Thursday (which is  not entirely your fault either).\nI did enjoy MACGYVERED a lot especially on the same puzzle with WINGIT and IMONIT. I was able to divine the FABFIVE but not the Brooklyn NETS without crosses; I didn’t remember they had moved to New Jersey but even if I had I would have called “foul” on the clue, even if they train in Brooklyn the clue is grammatically way off (unless I’m missing something?) \nNo shade on INIGO Montoya or Princess Bride, but just once I’d like to see a throwback clue to the great London architect INIGO Jones who is worth learning about.\nAnyways, Kit, congrats again this was a fine effort and I look forward to seeing more from you!","createDate":"1769661191","updateDate":"1769730799","approveDate":"1769661193","recommendations":22,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148460272","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-29","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.47244390845298767}

I felt like I didn't know enough of the proper names, and I simply was not getting the clues.\n\nI decided to persevere on my own though, and sure enough, surprisingly quickly I managed to fill most of the grid, making some ultimately correct guesses for the arcana (the like of FAB FIVE - not only was I unfamiliar with the name: I have no idea how many players there are on any other sport team than in soccer).\n\nWith crosses it became obvious what the themed entries would be. Not that I understood the theme, mind you. This was the biggest letdown today - I believe it should not be possible to solve a Thursday without getting the gimmick. It's fine on Monday or Tuesday, but today, when rhe gimmick is supposed to be (IMO, anyway) the main feature of the puzzle? I needed the column to get what I had entered, but I still solved in Wednesday time.\n\nIn Poland you are allowed to drink in any vehicle - other than on public transport. What is illegal is exceeding the maximum blood alcohol level. As long as you're under the limit, you can be sipping vodka behind the wheel even. Strangely enough, because it's illegal to drink (rather than be under the influence) in public places, the municipal police often fines people for having an open bottle of alcohol with them on the street or in the park - even if they're not actually drinking.","createDate":"1769663439","updateDate":"1769724055","approveDate":"1769663440","recommendations":15,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148460537","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-29","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5491570830345154}

Hope this doesn't appear twice)\n\nA few more random thoughts on Mann's Mountain\n\n1. The Title: Magic is the first choice for Zauber in dictionaries.  Related to Magus it contains suggestions of supernatural or wizarding powers.  Enchanted or Enchanting Mountain could work, but so could Wonderful.  Seems like Magic sounds better to an English reader and it's alliterative.\n \n2. Hans is no Percival or Parzifal.  He is not on a Quest.  He's just following a Doctor's suggestion.  Possibly The Fool of the Tarot deck proceeding, unbeknownst to him, on a Hero's Journey or a more prosaic process of psychological Individuation.\n\n3.  How about an oddysey trying to return home? Settimbrini raises this explicitly: “This is the island of Circe and you are no Oddyseus.”  The patients haven't been turned into pigs, but they “eat like wolves” and spend their time with flirtation and temperature.  Hans does not take the advice to escape while he can,\n.\n4. The music at Hans' first concert included operatic pieces from Carmen and Der Freischütz.  Carmen shows how an exotic, (Gypsy), temptress destroys a young man through the power of love.  Der Freischütz, which has been described as the most German of operas, has a young man make a deal with The Devil  so that he may win his girlfriend's hand.

I do think that it is a common enough word that it wouldn’t need a language marker; but it probably would have needed something else; I figured “love, love, love” meant love something a lot and AMORE wouldn’t have worked. So if I were flyspecking I would have focused on that spot and if I hadn’t heard of FOLIE A MEUX would have looked it up to make sure I was right (my rules for myself, yours may vary).\nBut more importantly I don’t think the presence of a personal Natick represents the challenge of an entire puzzle. You can have a Monday puzzle where two words cross that you just don’t know. I think you and Barry could both be right, where that crossing was hard for you but the rest of the puzzle could have been very easy. Moreover, it’s just one of those weird coincidences. I don’t think it was an intentional misdirect, usually the clue for ADORE would have been considered very straightforward, it just happened to cross a less common term at an ambiguous letter.

The site I use (Puzzle Baron I think) keeps the timer running regardless of whether you've paused to go to another website, or to take a nap.  If you care about times it's a much different experience than in the Times (ha ha).  Plus, you're competing to be \"above average\" in solving time (which is defined by solving it in less time than the average). \n   Two things: One, if you care about times, the non-stop timer can turn you into an ogre (\"I can't acknowledge your existence!  I'm being timed!\"). This is even worse,when you're being interrupted byba NYT puzzler who \"knows\" that the timer can be paused - and you can't stop to enlighten them because seconds often matter.\n  Two, the timing scheme is absurd anyway, because people clearly solve the puzzle and come back and solve it again, simply typing in the answer the second time around and getting a time in the seconds, not minutes.","createDate":"1769677997","updateDate":"1769710844","approveDate":"1769677998","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148460163,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148461763","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7739249467849731}

Here's my explanation:\nPhonics is - at least partly - a system of teaching people how to read by 'sounding out' the words on the page. Occasionally controversial in North American education, with it going in and out of favour in different decades.\n\nWhen I started school, we were given workbooks to practice in for this sounding out of words. Those books were titled along the lines of Phonics for Early Readers, Phonics 1, Phonics 2, etc. Collectively, Phonics workbooks.\n\nWhat I'm \"hearing\" is the result of sounding out (in my head) the letters. For example, seeing TOMORTOMORTOMOR on the screen has me thinking \"tow-more-tow-more-tow-more\"; which led me to \"Three 'tow-more's in a row. Oh! It's a row of 'tow-more's, so a tow-more-row = tomorrow\". Which fits the clue.\n\nSimilarly, I decoded 37A as a row of sore-sore-sore-...= 'sore-row' = sorrow.\n\nBut the process doesn't work for 20A, because when I look at the answer I'm thinking jee-jee-jee-... or guh-guh-guh-...\nExtending the \"sound it out\" pattern from 37A and 52A leads to the nonsense sounding 'row of jees = jeerow', or 'row of guhs = guhrow'. Neither are even English words, never mind being an answer to the clue!\n\nBTW, I also have a hard time with your name. I think of you as 'And-rez-edge', but I doubt very much that that's how your wife says it.","createDate":"1769705751","updateDate":"1769724307","approveDate":"1769705752","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148460947,"parentUserDisplayName":"Grumpy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148472987","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8070997595787048}

That show borrowed it as a convention from Major Bowes, whose \"Original Amateur Hour\" debuted on WHN in New York City around April, 1934.\n\nIn an interview in 1935, Bowes said that he created it because he had an hour to fill, and used the gong because the stereotypical hook was, of course, a visual gag that didn't work on radio. I, also, can't find examples of gongs being used for that purpose on stage so, if it happened, it was at least rare.\n\nI assume the primary reason Bowes went with it was that he found the dramatic sound funny in the context of a talent show, although as a verb \"gong\" meaning \"to stop\" from the use of bells by the traffic police to signal drivers to halt also emerged in the 1930s.\n\n(And of course for a good half-century before that it was familiar in ending sports bouts)","createDate":"1769686679","updateDate":"1769724567","approveDate":"1769686681","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148461937,"parentUserDisplayName":"SBK","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148462895","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8809803128242493}
