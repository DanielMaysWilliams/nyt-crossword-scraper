It was a good one for me to jump back into after not being able to finish the last few.

Plus, the most turbulent ferry ride I've ever had from our island to the mainland. You'd think all the delays would have helped me finish the puzzles, but my head wasn't there. Plus, it's a lot to travel internationally under normal circumstances with my dear MIL, who is pretty advanced in years and dementia, but with all the delays and confusion of this one, it was pretty rough.

For example, early in my crossword solving journey, I would never have guessed URNS for 58A (never heard that term used outside of cremating human remains), and 44D: IN HD appeared in the crossword somewhat recently, so I tuned in to that answer right away.\n\nAll that to say, I think you belong on this planet with the rest of us.
