It’s become part of my daily routine- the only one I usually skip is the Saturday puzzle, as I find it much too difficult to solve. I’ve noticed that within the past 4-6 weeks, your daily puzzles are becoming more difficult, not in an interesting way, but in such an esoteric manner, that they’ve become increasingly frustrating, and less interesting. Your Monday and Tuesday puzzles haven’t changed much, but the rest of the week’s puzzles are filled with clues from places that no matter what generation one comes from are no longer clever, no longer put a smile on my face once I solve them, but are more like a variety of random clues and confounding themes, that leave me overly frustrated, and sorry I spent time on the puzzle in the first place. In the past, the more experienced a puzzle player was, the faster the theme presented itself.

But I didn't think rebus at first; I spelled NORTH upwards, turning EAST when I hit the wall, so 8D was \"tron\" and 8A was THIRD. I guess I convinced myself a [Challenger] was someone who came in third place?\n\nAt 15A I had entered OSCAR WILDE as a guess, and OSCAR was fine but WILDE was not working with THIRD above it. So I convinced myself that the quote came from some other OSCAR; I even convinced myself that WILDE would have said \"poorly cast\" rather than \"badly cast\".\n\nOnce I finally got rebussy with it and got the happy music I went to find the quote. Here is the more extended version of it:\n\n“Actors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications. Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and our Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal.

To be fair, it probably doesn't help that yesterday's puzzle was (to me) so completely and utterly, puzzle level cloud nine, delightful... leaving me on an all-time puzzle high! \n\nAnyhow, it took a while but I got it. The revealer came slowly for me but I almost got the rebus picture before that with the SOUTH clue... only, I had only SH, thinking it would be HOLDSHOPE, which made perfect sense for me but resulted in taking longer to see that it was supposed to be fully spelled out directions. \n\nIKEA baffled me because I knew it had to be IKEA, but what on earth would follow IKEA?! I mean, I know it is a STORE but I really never imagined that was the answer since it's not the name. I did not know the answer in the NORTH so that was no help. And the WEST, I thought should read TSEW. \n\nBut none of that bothered me. I just didn't find anything particularly fun in it. I like fun wordplay and witticisms and I didn't really notice any. But I guess I learned that there are BOSNS and EXURBS in the world...  :-)\n\nSo, that's my mileage! \n\nHere's the fun I did have (you can always find some fun, if you look closely enough): I wanted 20A to be \"Call me,\" which I thought would be cute.
