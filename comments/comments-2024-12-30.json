Clues like [Pepsi or Coke] where there are a couple of possible answers, but not a slew.  Still, you can’t just slap the answer down.  Clues like [Places for policy wonks], where you might need several crosses before seeing the answer.\n\nThis puzzle is well made, with not only “Oh, isn’t that interesting” clues, such as those for ZEBRA and ALBERTA, but also covering many areas – music, geography, food, sports, current parlance, flora and fauna, and others.  Also, the answer set is admirably free of junk.\n\nNot to mention a bit of serendipity fun, TENOR in the grid to complement ALTO SAX, and the lovely PuzzPair© of a backward WETS crossing WATER.\n\nAnd for an experienced solver, as I am, trying to guess the reveal after uncovering the theme answers, plenty of sweet brainwork before throwing in the towel.\n\nQuality all around, an impressive debut.

I was a fervent NoRomo (\"Mulder and Scully are friends with a deep connection and also attraction but c'mon they don't need to get married and move to the suburbs and have two-and-a-half kids and a dog, jeez\"). \"Shippers\" is basically short for \"Relationshippers\", and it's a term used by TV fans everywhere, including I think the show \"Castle\" and many other shows. And at some point I guess it became a verb, to 'ship' two characters on a TV show or whatnot.\n\nThe pinnacle of Shipper stupidity on the active and playful X-Files forum was when one RabidShipper® reacted to the tongue-in-cheek parody-posts of NoRomos (posts that insisted, just to stir up the Shippers, that Mulder and Scully Hate Each Other [MASHEO]), with the RabidShipper responding in all caps \"YOU ARE ALL MAD & STUPID!!!!\" which became our battle cry. It was all great fun. But despite not being a teenager or young'n, even then, I've known the term \"SHIP\" for quite some time.\n\nAnd we won't even TALK about \"slash\".
