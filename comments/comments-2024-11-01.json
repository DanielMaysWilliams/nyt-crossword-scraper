It was supposed to be punny, I guess, but really, how are men and women , and only men and women, opposites, exactly - because that's what's being implied? Is it some of the Mars/Venus trope BS? Also, character opposites attract for all genders and identities, don't they?\n\nAnyway, I found this puzzle very hard in places, and not in an enjoyable way. NE and SW was easy, SE less so, and NW almost defeated me. I needed trivia lookups for some 5 entries.\n\nI've never heard of CHARLIE BUCKET and as a dog person with a chocolate lab for his best friend I really wanted the clue to be about dogs. The column explained the entry to me... Impossibly arcane to somebody who's never seen the movie, like me. It's not at all popular over here.\n\nAlso, dryers are not common in Poland, so DRYER SHEET I had to get from crosses. Most of us live in apartments 50-70 m² (our flat is 90 m², which is huge by Warsaw standards and unaffordable for most people), we do our laundry in our bathrooms, usually, and they are smaller than in the US - a typical bathroom is ca. 5 m², and many are smaller than that. You can't fit two huge devices into a room of that size. Very few people have space for a laundry room. On top of that, dryers or combo washers/dryers are expensive to buy and run, given European electricity costs.\n\nI don't get the clue for CRAW.

One reason was the bevy of stalwart crossword answers – i.e. AS IS, AVOWS, GRR, CLAN – that were given prosaic clues, providing a wealth of footholds.  \n\nActually, IMO, most of the puzzles this week have been easier than typical for the day of the week they fell on, that is, low-stress, and, given that it’s the week before a nail-biting election, I say, “Thank you, editors!”\n\nIn his five previous NYT puzzles, Spencer had shown himself to be a superb wordplayer, so I entered this grid with a skip to my step.  He delivered again today, with entertaining clues for OLDE, DELI, and ONLINE POKER.  Plus…\n\nThat world-class [Golden retriever who ends up with a chocolate lab] for CHARLIE BUCKET.  During the fill-in, the answer didn’t mean a thing to me because while I’m familiar with the story he’s in, I don’t remember the full names of the kids in it.  But after the solve, when I looked him up, then saw “Golden retriever” in the clue, I swooned in celebration. \n\nThere was also beauty in answer today, i.e., DE-ESCALATE, A JOB IS A JOB, SEND IT BACK.  All of these, BTW, are NYT answer debuts.\n\nKindness, wordplay spark, and beauty – that is one sweet combination.

If I give you two points on a piece of paper and ask you to draw the line between them you will get out a straight edge and connect them. If I draw a curve between them and ask you if that’s a straight line you will say no, because it’s not the shortest distance. Miami and Lagos are both near the Tropic of Cancer. If I ask you to fly between them in the shortest distance you WON’T fly along the Tropic of Cancer—you will fly along the great circle connecting them (the one that cuts the globe exactly in half). The Tropic of Cancer is thus like a curve in the sphere and the great circle is a straight line. And all great circles on a sphere meet every other great circle twice (for that you are going to have to try visualizing yourself).

I went through most of it pretty quickly for me, which is still a lot slower than many of you... not that I need an EGOBOOST or anything.

I have watched two versions of the movie (the earliest and the latest) but the name did not ring out to me so I had to accept the crosses. I still wasn't sure who he was till I looked him up and slapped my forehead!!  I'm terrible with character names. \n\nIt took another JILLION years to get my last cross—SPAYS and PICS. I only remember TYKE being spelled TiKE. I thought of shots as drinks, vaccines, things being fired, etc., but it took me a while to think of PICS and then, of course, no golden retriever, err, star because what the heck is SPAIS. \n\nI finally tried a Y in case TYKE was a variant spelling, since spays would make sense... turns out TiKE is the variant and lesser-used. Who knew!? I mean, other than most of you, the constructer, the editors, the columnists, pretty much most people, it seems... Har! \n\nMaybe I do need an EGOBOOST, which was actually my favorite one this time and I'm a big Idris ELBA fan, so that was fun. Lots of fun ones! \n\nCan't wait to get my IVOTEDSTICKER!

BCE poet from the island of Lesbos. She famously wrote lyric poems expressing her love/lust for other women--but also some addressed to young men. And perhaps those addressed to women were written in an assumed \"male voice,\" as was the convention. Also, she wasn't the only ancient Greek poet from Lesbos--there was her (male) contemporary Alcaeus: together, they were known as the \"Lesbian poets.\" \n\nBy the time ancient Roman love-poets were kicking around, the term \"Lesbian\" had acquires the connotation of \"elegantly romantic\"--poets would talk about drinking \"Lesbian wine\"--even though the wines from Lesbos (at least then) were considered pretty bad. And Catullus addressed his (quite heterosexual) love poems to Lesbia--probably a stand-in name for a Roman aristocrat who was married to someone else.\n\nToday is All-Saint's Day, and one of the most popular hymns for the day is \"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God,\" which was penned in the early 20th c. by one Lesbia Scott--whose parents probably named her after the character in Catullus, and not for some forecast of her future orientations.\n\n(He doffs his chapeau didactique.)\n\nIn any case, @super8ing's OP was really quite droll:-)","createDate":"1730482580","updateDate":"1730516003","approveDate":"1730482583","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137281007,"parentUserDisplayName":"Super8ing","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137284262","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8259857296943665}
