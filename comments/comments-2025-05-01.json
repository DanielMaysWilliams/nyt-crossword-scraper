I didn’t think I was being dismissive of animated children’s movies, and of course there is value in them for both kids and adults. My point was merely that, by and large, their audiences are kids and adults with kids, and having two proper names from children’s and YA literature and/or movies cross each other runs counter to how most NYT puzzle handle their trivia clues.

Like you, I was never into fantasy and such. \n\nThen, in my mid-40s, a friend heartily encouraged, and ultimately convinced, me to to read the books. \n\nBy that point, I knew that our dream of having kids together would never come true and I was still struggling to learn how to carry that tremendous grief. \n\nReading Harry Potter was incredibly healing for me. I didn't expect it, but it did happen. There is a scene in the first book in which Harry is very lovingly told, \"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\" \n\nThat hit me—hard! \n\nThere are incredibly beautiful themes throughout HP that I'm sure are missed by most children. I've read through them a few times since, though I do not enjoy the movies, and continue to find enlightenment and comfort in them. I hope you will find the same when you read them with your nieces. \n\nAlso, if you do take on more animated films, be warned that the first 10/15 minutes of Up is heartbreaking for anyone who wanted kids, but couldn't for whatever reason. I was literally sobbing and wailing in the theater. It was awful—awful! I had no idea and it hit me out of nowhere. It was beautifully done, mind, but devastating.
