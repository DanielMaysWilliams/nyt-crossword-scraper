I remember someone remarking that this speaks to Lempel's brilliance because paradoxically Monday puzzles are the hardest to make lively and still worth doing for the highbrows out there. When her 100th puzzle aired (3-6-23) Rachel Fabi wrote,\n\nI spoke with The Times’s senior puzzle editor, Joel Fagliano, about Ms. Lempel, whom he called “a pro in every aspect of crossword making.” “One of Lynn’s hallmarks, in my book, is just very to-the-point, interesting and engaging clue writing,” Mr. Fagliano said. “This was an easy edit.”\n\nThis puzzle fits the bill, too, with enough zhuzh* to keep anyone's attention and some quality wordplay. Ma in drag, woot! My only quibble is that the revealer really does seem like an awkward afterthought: HALFTIME could have been half anything: halfwit, half empty, half hearted, better half...\n\nLoved all the great words, especially rennet -- threw in a little Thursday action there did yah? -- and good to see poor old Duncan, I guess you can say he had it coming -- and Klondike and Antlers gave the southeast quadrant of the puzzle an abnormally chilly NW blast, where the ORE is. Heck, in a minute I'll be reciting \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" if you don't watch out.\n\n*Yes, I do feel a sense of potential future self loathing for having written \"zhuzh,\" but I also refuse to replace the word.

Not quite as fun as an egg hunt, eh? I once went with my then-girlfriend to have her basket blessed and all I got was holy water in my eyes - the priest was apparently bent on blessing everybody and everything in the room, not just the eggs and sausages.

We all know what a DOOK is and I found this puzzle absolutely delightful.  And I was SO slow getting the trick because I didn't see it at MAIN DRAG.  \"What on earth?\" I'm thinking.  Saw the light at DOOR NAILS, after which I went back to MA IN DRAG and said: \"How clever!\"  I then guessed the next two themers with very few crosses.\n\nAll the DOOKS are clued exceptionally fairly and with real specificity -- making the \"Aha\" moments even better.\n\nAnd what a gorgeous junk-free grid!  I found this a really enjoyable Tuesday puzzle on every level.","createDate":"1710856989","updateDate":"1710897154","approveDate":"1710856991","recommendations":15,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131954596","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7393206357955933}

This might be my first Tuesday completed without any lookups! The theme became evident to me with 36A, and I was bemused by 26A. Definitely a STRESS-free puzzle, crafted by a talented WORDSMITH :)","createDate":"1710814985","updateDate":"1710977010","approveDate":"1710814987","recommendations":43,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131947109","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9790756702423096}

I think it’s like that dress that consumed our attention a few years back — was it white and gold (yes!!) or two other colors that I can’t recall? I think compound words are like that - binary. You see ‘em or you don’t but it’s no indication of whether you are a WORDSMITH or not!\n\nLynn, I liked the three military entries, even if one is CAPN Crunch 🤣. As a former Air Force member, I remember being so proud to reach E4 (equivalent to CPL), that I hardly think of it as a low military rank. I supervised several people who were of actual low rank but who had responsible positions, as well. I also enjoyed seeing EPAULETS, which came later in my military career.\n\nThe three words that I only got through crossings were RENNET, SKOR and ENID. After solving the puzzle, the former word led me down a cheese-making rabbit hole that I was happy to hop out of! I really didn’t enjoy learning how the sausages were made! Also, my Oklahoma geography is very limited.\n\nQuick and fun puzzle. Crunchier than yesterday, as it should be. \n\nAproveitem o dia, amigos!","createDate":"1710822473","updateDate":"1710866187","approveDate":"1710822475","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131948332","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5483889579772949}

It has stood (and probably still can stand) for both. I definitely learned it as “questioning” when I was first exposed to the term LGBTQ, but I can’t say if the Q has always stood for both or if “queer” came later. For sure the term “queer” was previously a slur, but was re-appropriated by the LGBTQ community, so maybe that word was later attached to that letter once “queer” became more mainstream as a term of pride rather than a slur. \n\nI think the A in LGBTQIA+ can also stand for a more than one thing (asexual or aromantic, but also ally) 😊\n\n🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈","createDate":"1710852793","updateDate":"1710871058","approveDate":"1710852795","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131948008,"parentUserDisplayName":"Fender","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131952438","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8089815378189087}
