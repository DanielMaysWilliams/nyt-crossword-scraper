It could have helped to reveal the puzzle’s gimmick, but for me, at least, I was so engrossed in the rest of the puzzle, that when I got down to the bottom, where the reveal was, I had totally forgotten that circle.\n\nSo, when I uncovered ONE EYE and saw what was going on, and saw that circle again, it was a fantastic “Oh yeah, I forgot about that!” moment.  Joseph got me good there, and I love being gotten good!\n\nAlso, I don’t think anyone so far has mentioned that they noticed anything unusual in the cluing until it was pointed out in the revealer, certainly not I.  Bravo to Joseph for pulling that off, depriving the clues of a common vowel – and have no one notice it.   He got me good there again.  \n\nOne more way he fooled me.  I tooled through the puzzle thinking that it was simply a myth-based tribute, with no thought that there was an underlying gimmick.  So, when I uncovered the ONE EYE reveal, oh, trust me, that elicited a huge “Hah!”\n\nAs I said, Joseph, I love being gotten good, and to be gotten good three times, well, three’s the charm.

For the Odyssey, the time span is about 4 weeks, and perhaps for the Iliad about the same time. For the Odyssey, the story begins on the island with Calypso; the Trojan War had ended some ten years earlier. Odysseus builds a raft and 18 days later is shipwrecked on the island of the Phaeacians, a seafaring people with magical boats. They return him to Ithaka in a day or two. There Odysseus executes his revenge on the suitors. The subject of the Iliad is a dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon over a woman, a war prize. This occurs in the ninth year of the war over possibly a 3 to 4 week period; the war itself is the backdrop. Achilles refuses to fight and the Trojans, led by Hektor, are winning until Achilles gets back into the battle and eventually kills Hektor. There is no mention of the Trojan Horse, not in the Iliad.","createDate":"1713353237","updateDate":"1713378996","approveDate":"1713353240","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132592848,"parentUserDisplayName":"JB","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132595439","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7295976877212524}
