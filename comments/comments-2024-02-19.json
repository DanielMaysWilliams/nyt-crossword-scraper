How I miss that!!\n\nIn Portugal, where I otherwise happily live, one goes to a cafe or restaurant and properly sits down to eat for ridiculously long, relaxing time. No wait staff will bother you until you ask. The food is fresh, and the coffee was just beans just moments ago. The bill will be shockingly inexpensive.

It creates an extra layer of riddle that makes the puzzle more compelling.\n\nSo, there I was looking at the ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR theme answers, wrestling my brain, trying to find some connection anywhere.  Totally stymied.  I went to step two – read the clue to the revealer, which led me to look at what was counted in the second word of each theme answer.\n\nAt first, I thought it was vowels, because that worked for the first two theme answers.  But no.  Nor did consonants work.  When SYLLABLES finally hit me, well, I have to say, that was one sweet I GOT IT moment.  And right after the spontaneous “Hah!” and “Aha!” it wrought, my whole being was flooded with praise for what hits me as a most original and splendid theme, and filled with respect and gratitude for being so superbly outwitted.\n\nThe cherry on top was when I saw GONZO and BEANS in that little SE corner, and my brain shouted “Garbanzo!”  \n\nLovely touch, Adam, stacking three NYT answer debuts VAPER, FOUR DIMENSIONAL, and BAD NAME.  But your theme especially hit my happy button.  This was one terrific Monday puzzle.

Its final realization in 1997 overcame the obstacles of WWII, Wright's death in 1959, environmental concerns, and the presence of native Ho-Chunk Nation historic burial mounds. Alas for me and my bride, the project required the teardown of the lovely Madison Club, where we had our wedding reception in 1980. In the colder winters back then, we used to watch the iceboats on the much larger Lake Mendota, on the opposite side of the capital isthmus.
