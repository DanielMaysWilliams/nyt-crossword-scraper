I started it about a year before I started the crosswords, which was about 10 months ago now, and it totally helps my crossword game! Before I was playing that, I would also have not known LUSAKA so easily.

Generally, I look forward to the (often pun-fueled) “aha” moment of filling in the revealer and seeing the way it ties the theme entries together, but this time, my reaction was more of an “I guess.” Pavlov and Quasimodo are gimmes, and Peale was a nice addition to the theme, but Willy Loman and Santa Claus left me scratching my head, Sure, Santa’s associated with the sound of sleighbells, but it’s hardly the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the name. It took some further thinking to realizethe bells mentioned here are the ones associated not with Saint Nick himself but specifically with the Salvation Army Santas. And as for Willy Loman, I know enough about the play to know the name but not enough to associate him with bells — I came to the column hoping to be enlightened and was disappointed to discover that the only connection to the theme was that he is a door-to-door salesman.\n\nI did enjoy the repetition of “hold your horses,” the guest appearances by Eartha Kitt and Syd Hoff, and the tangentially theme-related “heralds.” (On that note, there are enough holiday-related entries in this grid that it might have worked better in December rather than May.)

Some set new records (I was a little more than half my Tuesday avg) and a lot of people felt it was hard for a Tuesday. \n\nIf you go to the town of Natick's website, you can find Rex Parker's explanation of the term \"Natick\":\n\nA long time ago, I was solving this puzzle and got stuck at an unguessable (to me) crossing: N. C. WYETH crossing NATICK at the “N”—I knew WYETH but forgot his initials, and NATICK … is a suburb of Boston that I had no hope of knowing. It was clued as someplace the Boston Marathon runs through (???). Anyway, NATICK— the more obscure name in that crossing—became shorthand for an unguessable cross, esp. where the cross involves two proper nouns, neither of which is exceedingly well known. NATICK took hold as crossword slang, and the term can now be both noun (“I had a NATICK in the SW corner…”) or verb (“I got NATICKED by 50A / 34D!”)\n===================\nSo yes, anyone who doesn't know the answers to two crossing clues--particularly when both are proper nouns--can claim a personal Natick. \n\nI enjoyed this puzzle. It was in my wheelhouse (obvi given my solve time). I knew WILLY LOMAN, EARTHA Kitt, AKITA, I___Pavlov [Ivan or Igor?], and several others on my first pass. Geography is a weak suit, so LUKASA came entirely from crosses, but all six crosses fell on my first pass.
