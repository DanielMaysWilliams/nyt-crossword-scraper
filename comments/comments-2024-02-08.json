That boosts the quality of the theme.\n\nThen you added the “opposites attract” motif, that is, you found pairs of answers that fulfilled the above condition, AND contained opposite components, AND fulfilled the requirements of symmetry!  Wow, and once again, what a pro you are, Samuel A.\n\nThat motif, where the answers had to be reversed to fit their clues, AND that the reversals happened because the opposites “attracted” each other, well, that is a spectacular double-whammy theme you made.
