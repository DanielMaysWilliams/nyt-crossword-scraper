In the 1940’s, he was introduced to a new manufacturing material, but unlike Dustin Hoffman’s character in The Graduate, he decided plastics were his future. He held a contest to name his new plastic-based toy company, and like many a corporate boss before and since, declared himself the winner. The new name was derived from the Danish words LEG and GODT, meaning “play well”. \n\nKristiansen bought an injection molding machine from a company that helpfully provided some samples of the work the machine could produce—including some interlocking plastic bricks from a company called Kiddicraft. LEGO made and marketed its own version of the toy bricks while the Kiddicraft company foundered, seemingly unaware that its patented idea had been co-opted. (The inventor committed suicide in 1957.)\n\nMany ups and downs later, the LEGO company is thriving— and very protective of its name. It insists that LEGO be used only as an adjective, not a noun, in order to protect the brand from becoming a generic term for any plastic building block. (Like, say, a Kiddicraft brick.) The name must also be capitalized, as the LEGO gods intended. If you say “Legos” instead of “LEGO bricks”, the Kragle will find you and glue your mouth shut.

Interestingly though, I just realized Polish doesn't pluralize the word, either. We may say \"klocek LEGO/klocki LEGO\" (LEGO brick/bricks; klocek does not literally mean \"brick\" btw - that would be \"cegła\"; it's just our name for a toy brick), but we would never pluralize LEGO itself - which would make it LEGa - for words ending in \"-o\" our way to make them plural is to change that \"o\" into an \"a\": chomąto/chomąta (horse collar/collars), or \"stado/stada\" (herd/herds). \n\nIt's not like Polish has some rule about avoiding pluralizing brand-related names, either. For example, in Polish trainers (the shoes) are known as \"adidasy\", which is a plural generic noun derived from the brand name. In this case we are fine with pluralization. A lot of Mercedes cars are Mercedesy. But I've never seen Volvo pluralized. What a linguistic mess 🤣\n\nBtw, ROLD Gold is one of the most random things I've ever seen in my life. Get your sh... together, American brand namers! I know it's probably because you can't trademark a natural language phrase like \"rolled gold\" but c'mon, ROLD...\n\nFinally, the puzzle was heavy on trivia, but gentle crosses let that not be an issue for me.
