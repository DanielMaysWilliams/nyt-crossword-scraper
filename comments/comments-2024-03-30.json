Is there a word for that feeling?! \n\nI'm not great by any means, but I'm better than I was three months ago. This Saturday solve, though VERY tough for me - especially in the NW - feels like a high note.\n\nSpring break is over, I'll be back to my normal work and mom grind.

It's a rude and discordant word that few would use in polite mixed company. Basic, attentive editing could have easily altered it to be CRAMPED, by 11d being MER, and 14d being DEPRESS, and a clever clue could easily have been substituted for \"Can\".\n\nJust as the editors regularly see fit to permit the inclusion of, or cutesy cluing for, a vulgar term for the buttocks (or its equally rude British equivalent), today's puzzle is indicative of an abandonment of a formerly reliable level of decency on this page.

I also had to eventually put on check puzzle a few times.\n\nOn my first pass, I immediately knew ECUADOR, which I feel somewhat proud of...  But I only knew it because I love an Ecuadoran restaurant in Minneapolis called Chimborazo, very much. I enjoyed the fun fact about the peak of Chimborazo and the Earth's center. I also got ERNST, TAT, and ENS on the first pass... That was it. 😬\n\nSecond run, I picked up ABIDE from Ecuador. That was it. 😳  I did enjoy that particular clue!\n\nI eventually sludged through with a little help from my friend, Google. I'm amazed I didn't need more then the five lookups, to be honest but I was really trying to push myself.\n\nAll in all, a very humbling experience... just when I start to rejoice about my improvements in puzzling, this comes along and knocks me the back a few notches.
