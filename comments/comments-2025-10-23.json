The movement is built around a half-step between the notes E-sharp and F-sharp, repeated insistently. The recording I linked was by the great pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard.\n\nApparently this piece was used for a scene in the Stanley Kubrick film *Eyes Wide Shut*, which I've never seen. I have no idea what the film is about, but the scene involves a bunch of people wearing Halloween fright masks, parading around a baroque ballroom in a circle, whilst someone in a red cape waves a censor at them. The whole thing looks like a scene from Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, except the Buffy scene would have peppier music. But at least we don't have to hear Tom Cruise speak. In the spirit of the Season, I will link it anyway (the recording used is the same one by Aimard):\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch-x7wZulYQ&list=RDCh-x7wZulYQ&start_radio=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch-x7wZulYQ&list=RDCh-x7wZulYQ&start_radio=1</a>\n\nKubrick was famously fond of Ligeti's music, and in *2001: a Space Odyssey*, used a couple of his pieces--a the Kyrie from his Requiem, and the orchestral piece *Atmosphères* (used in its entirety, or almost)--to great effect.","createDate":"1761218332","updateDate":"1761308308","approveDate":"1761218332","recommendations":9,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146135413","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8137485980987549}

I have random sessions of chills/fever, a side effect from chemo for pancreatic cancer that ended 9 years ago.  Doc says no, once the chemo ends, so do the side effects, but support sites confirm that I'm not alone, and they don't.  \n\nAs for COVID, thanks so much for your concern. We get booster shots as soon as they are available, and we had ours this month. We always have tests on hand just in case.  \n\nDespite being vaxxed, we had COVID during the lockdown, considered mild cases, ended by Paxlovid, but if that was what it's like when it's mild, you don't ever want to have it at all.  The ongoing damage from unrestrained COVID can be devastating, for those who manage to survive it, and we dodged those by being vaxxed.\n\nThe world was able to stop polio, and we could do the same with COVID if we all participated in the fight together. People are still dying from COVID and others are suffering long COVID.  Get vaccinated, people. It could quite literally save your life, as I'm sure it did ours.  \n\nAgain, thanks for your advice and good wishes.  I'm a bit shaky today, but no chills, no fever.  Just another short visit from my old \"friend\" Gemzar. It only happens only once or twice a year now, but early on I had a lot of trips to the ER.\n\nI have some sneaky new health issues, but they were bound to start sometime.

There was a closet behind it that was accessible via just barely enough space to get through on its left side if you swiveled the TV back in order to avoid hitting it.\n\nWe loved using the fireplace, though we didn't do so that often, since I was always the one tending the fire, and I had a ground rule that the Mrs. had to have at least two hours to sit in the room enjoying it.  (I also was the one cutting the wood for it.)\n\nThe new place had a fireplace, too.  It was a plug-in electric one.  It looked so cheesy!  One of the first things we did was give it the boot, and replace it with a ginormous TV that practically covered the whole wall.\n\nWe also bought a small table to place below it, to hold the subwoofer and a few other items, and hide the wires.\n\nI personally am not going to miss the fireplace.

Well, in tonal music, music that is based on a seven-note, diatonic scale (which is most of the music we listen to, classical and pop), the (half) step between E-sharp and F-sharp is the step between \"leading tone\" and \"tonic\"--the step between jammy-bready Tea, and Doe, to Maria von Trapp. Since it's the note which \"leads\" your ear back to (tonic) home, it's a very important interval.\n\nIn fact, on an instrument without a fixed pitch--a violin, say, as opposed to a piano--a good performer will make a subtle distinction between an F, and an E-sharp leading into F-sharp, to emphasize the \"leaning.\" (Obviously, we pianists can't make that happen.)\n\nThe interval between F and F-sharp is called an \"augmented unison,\" which is pretty weird concept; but there are plenty of times when you want to notate it in that way--in pieces based on a chromatic scale, say; think \"Flight of the Bumblebee.\"\n\nThere are plenty of rules and conventions about how to notate chromatic music, which serve two purposes: 1) it more accurately displays the harmonic processes going on; and 2) by providing consistency, it makes it easier for performers to sight-read unfamiliar music, on the fly, even if the differences are unconscious. I would have a harder time interpreting a C-sharp major triad when spelled C#-F-G# than C#-E#-G#\n\nHope this helps.","createDate":"1761239772","updateDate":"1761255431","approveDate":"1761239773","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146139482,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bill","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146147077","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.832435667514801}

Thanks for the description.\n  I’m guessing that before the Latin alphabetic notation of these tonal sequences, other notations existed. You alluded to that in the previous day’s GAMUT post.\n  I’m not sure when frequencies were “invented,” but probably long after the great composers gave us their work. \n  I really wonder if the great composers knew what we know about music theory. With the seven different modes, did they write based on a mode, or what to please the ear? Were they in the church when Lydian was in (for example), and developed their work from that? Did they know all the modes? Who knows.\n  I understand “leaning” in non-discrete non-fretted string instruments. We guitar players bend strings. Each fret is a semi tone and a ½ bend is a semitone bend up. A full bend, of course, being 2 semitones.\nMany times, for dissonance or consonance, a ¼ bend is needed. So, from the E, you’re right, it’s an E sharped, though not quite an F. For a bend down, there’s the tremolo bar. Acoustic guitar players don’t have that bar, of course.\nWhen I play with my buddies, we keep it simple. Most of us know modal, relative minor/majors of each chord, flatted 3rd’s, suspensions, etc. I’m usually the only one who knows this kind stuff and I keep it to myself. \nI’ll dig more into it for my own edification.\nThanks, Bill!","createDate":"1761270640","updateDate":"1761270641","approveDate":"1761270641","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146147077,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bill","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146158313","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7431708574295044}
