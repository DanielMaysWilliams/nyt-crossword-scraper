(Note: \"our innate nature as a species\" allows that there will be exceptions.) Despite our more enlightened society of the 2020s, I'm sure that far more girls still play with dolls than boys.\n\nAnd similarly, far more grownup women find a crossword about dolls more interesting than do grownup men.

All my childhood toys were lost when I was a teenager. We had a small-ish apartment so my parents stored the toys I was no longer playing with in the attic of a house they were building (and given the economy and our complicated financials at the time, it was a very slow process). Then another opportunity presented itself - dad's colleague was selling a larger house closer to the city center, and our family could just about afford it if we sold almost everything we had. So the apartment and the other house were sold. Sadly, we forgot to clear out the attic before the new owner took possession - and when we realized the mistake, he refused to give us the boxes of toys. I still miss my favorite plushie, a fox I can remember getting as a gift when I was four or so.

It was easy to see in that particular difficulty (ultimately unsuccessful years-long roller coaster of infertility treatments) because I was in a small community of women going through it but we are all different people and in varying stages of success and not success.

We had parties and played games and I could read to them. Playing with dolls fosters social skills, imagination, empathy, and caring for others. None of which would naturally appeal to a young boy unless they were taught fun ways to play with dolls. I know you aren't saying anything against dolls, rather sharing your experience as a kid. \n\nI have an honorary niece (who I adore), who is here with her mom a lot, and she carries her baby doll. Sometimes the doll feels sick or is hurt and little Bevie get sad and wonders how to help. Fortunately, I have a medical degree in doll doctoring from the University of HeathieJ, so Dr. HeathieJ to the rescue!! Bevie frets about her doll until I assure her she's all better and then she takes extra good care of her and then has a little party with her dinos and other dolls.\n\nBut we know that these \"softer\"/social type skills were traditionally encouraged more in girls than boys, of course. Just as competition and athleticism was traditionally more encouraged with boys. As an adult, I personally wish that I'd been more encouraged to be athletic and competitive—as well as playing with dolls—but we were very traditional, so my brothers did boy things and I did girl things. \n\nThese days, I think that is changing somewhat.

They are primarily imaginative toys, not objects that are just \"carried around.\" Playing with dolls allows children to practice empathy and communication, model interpersonal interactions, and create imaginative stories. Consider the parallels between making up a story about the lives and interpersonal conflicts of a collection of dolls and writing a novel or screenplay about the lives and interpersonal conflicts of a set of invented characters. Interpersonal and creative abilities are valuable skills for all adults.","createDate":"1739214547","updateDate":"1739241480","approveDate":"1739214548","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139664181,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139677277","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7452839612960815}
