The clues for fills that spanned it were so clever, some actually brilliant, that it was a joy to work when I finally got my toe in the door.\n\nMy first pass through the puzzle had one fill: VERSOS, and I was certain I was done. Then some X's turned up, and the paperboy's cry (which made me laugh) somehow unlocked the jam, and I started to see that my hunches on many of the fills were correct. (The coffee producer was a revelation, as was the source of that gumbo vegetable.)  \n\nExhilaration is the word that best describes what I'm feeling, now that the last fill is in and the puzzle is done (with only one look-up—sorry Liv, but I never saw the \"Ring\" movies). \n\nI send my heartfelt thanks to Daniel Grinberg for a masterwork of a puzzle.","createDate":"1710479360","updateDate":"1710728860","approveDate":"1710479362","recommendations":30,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131863810","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9666905403137207}

Vague cluing?  A feature, not a flaw.  Obscure trivia?  Ditto.  \n\nPlease don't denigrate the puzzle because you couldn't solve it.  You don't come to the crossword fully formed as a solver.  It takes years, decades even, to get to the point where you can always solve any puzzle.  Be positive, and you may get there.  (And I emphasize \"may\".

No, the issue here is one of proportion.\n\nRex Parker's blog is a terrific read, even though I find the vast majority of his gripes to fall under the aegis of one of about... oh a dozen or more arbitrary, subjective standards. If an answer doesn't cromulate with his politics, he complains. If an answer -- like MERER -- is not a feature of spoken English, he complains. He dumped on CARELESS MISTAKE because the clue was phrased \"this clue\" and not \"a clue\" (the clue itself was written as intended, i.e.).\n\nThat aside he nailed the problem with this one, the crosses for PHYLLIS WHEATLEY:  \n\n\"My main gripe with crossword editors, across the board, is that they aren't careful enough with their proper nouns. No matter what sphere or time period they come from, names that are not universally famous can be dangerous—they're gimmes for some and total blanks for others, and so already have the potential to create a very divided solving experience. So it's crucial that the less famous, and the more unconventionally spelled, the name is, the more you have to ensure that every cross is fair.\"\n\nAnd they were fair, just... far too tricky or obscure.

There is such a thrill when you come to the end of puzzle where the fills were not obvious but took some thinking, where the clues nudged the flexibility of your brain, and the crosses on fills such as people you didn't know made sure that you would see what they probably were or at least give you enough to google them. \n\nWhen a constructor assumes that you are an educated person who might have at least heard of, for instance, Walter Reed Hospital and why it was named for Reed, and also ensures that if you haven't, the crosses will give you enough to fill it anyway, you either have remembered something or will learn something, a quality that used to be more prevalent in puzzles than it is now.\n\nI will be 90 years old this summer and I do not have a college degree, but I solved this puzzle only one look-up (not counting a couple of checks to confirm spelling).
