When it refers to the people sketching things, it's pronounced in two syllables:  DRAW-ers.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to unblushingly use this rhyme when presenting at the BMI Musical Theater Workshop, a place where your knuckles would get rapped if you dared to use an imperfect rhyme.  I never did because I had cut my teeth on the lyricists of the American Songbook:  Larry Hart, Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Alan Jay Lerner, Ira Gershwin, and Sondheim.  But the very young Workshop members who had cut their teeth on sloppily written pop music lyrics, would often make that mistake in early presentations.  They were unlikely to make it more than once or twice.","createDate":"1730211464","updateDate":"1730270345","approveDate":"1730211467","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137192708,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137194161","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.681511640548706}
