In other words, in a regular Connections game, the category for the words in 22A would be titled \"--- STORE\".\n\nThe clever part of the puzzle is that the word for each first word is different in the solution:  (STORE) FRONTS, (SEASON) OPENERS, (TEAM) LEADERS, etc.  \n\n\nOn another note, I'd like to thank my niece for having ACL surgery about a month ago.  This allowed me to see BRACE for \"Boot\" almost immediately.  She'll be here for Father's Day, so I'll let you know how she's healing.\n\nI count eight different synonyms for \"something that comes first\", and each phrase is an in-the-language expression.","createDate":"1718492212","updateDate":"1718753184","approveDate":"1718492215","recommendations":20,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133940098","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5146061778068542}

MHOS are units of conductance.  Conductance is the opposite of resistance, and MHO is OHM backwards.

After a set period of time and absent the order to attack, they return to their bases.
