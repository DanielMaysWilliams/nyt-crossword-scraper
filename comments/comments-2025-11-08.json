I was done with most of it in Tuesday time, disbelieving how straightforward the clues seemed, especially on the right/Eastern side of the grid.\n\nHowever, the left/West side, and especially the NW corner, came close to defeating me. In the end I managed to fill the grid without googling, and in a time shorter than I usually get on Fridays, but a lot of guesses were involved, and I don't understand some of what I ultimately entered.\n\nThe column explained R-V guy to me (a quite obnoxious clue, that, IMO), and it confirmed my suspicion about Sport UTE (it just sounds so wrong... But us Polish people rarely shorten words, so most abbreviations feel jarring to me).\n\nI have no idea why SHORT STOP is one who's off-base.\n\nI had to guess OHIO (and IOWA). Why is it a \"red state\"? Are Ohio Reds a sport team or something?\n\nThere was something perverse about using the French \"au poivre\" and the American misnomer (of sorts) of \"entree\" in the same sentence. Because surely \"steak au poivre\" is not a French starter?\n\nRoquefort as BLUE CHEESE was a gimme. Before 1989 the shelves in Polish (state-owned) shops were mostly empty, and if there was something for sale, it was of one variety (one yellow cheese, one white cheese, etc.) Democracy and market economy meant privately owned shops with ever improving stock. Roquefort was the first blue cheese to be offered, as I recall.\n\n@dutchiris\n\nThank you for the poodle story yesterday 🐩😃.

It was a community theater revue in honor of their 75th anniversary.  My wife's cousin, who is about the same age as the theater company, was part of the cast, so we had to go.  The show consisted of musical numbers and scenes from some of the many shows they produced over the 75 years.\n\nThe production was uneven, to say the least, although my wife's cousin performed quite well (funny how we can say brother- or sister-in-law for one's spouse's sister, but \"cousin-in-law\" is somehow just not a thing).  One of the scenes last night was the opening scene from \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (the song is \"Tradition\"), which the cast nailed.\n\nSome of the other numbers were nails-on-the-blackboard shrill, and some others were quite good.\n\nWhich made me think, maybe Andrzej doesn't like musical theater because he hasn't seen any really good productions.  Does Poland even have an analog to Broadway?  Even within this one production, it was easy to see the difference between the truly enjoyable and the cringeworthy.\n\nAnyway, it was an interesting night out, but it wasn't \"Ragtime,\" which we saw on Broadway last week.","createDate":"1762606154","updateDate":"1762655988","approveDate":"1762606154","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146501473,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146503296","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6083695292472839}

I should have gotten up to find a pencil and paper to do it right.  But that stuff is in the part of the house where my wife is residing, and we're trying (unsuccessfully) to isolate from one another due to illness.\n\nLet's go through it step by step.  We agree that gold is about 19.3 g /cc or 19.3 kg / liter. Right?\n\nAnd we agree a basketball is about 7.5 liters.  Then the mass of gold the size of a basketball would be 7.5 x 19,300 g = 145,000 g or 145 kg, or about 320 pounds.  So, yeah, it would take a little less than 7 basketballs to make a ton.  Thanks for checking me.  Still a volume you could easily carry in the trunk of your car.\n\nConcerning Indy: you suggest that the dimensions of the golden idol was 30cm x 20cm x 10cm (I'm assuming you meant centimeters).  That's 6000 cc, (not 600 cc).  Or about 6 liters.  Thats about 6 liter x (19.3 kg/liter) = 115 kg, or about 255 pounds.\n\nI don't know if even a gorilla could hold 225 pounds in each hand, and then replace one with the other smoothly.  I'll try to find one to ask it.\n\nAnd I heartily agree that the bag of dirt or whatever he replaced it with couldn't possibly have been anywhere near the same volume.\n\nIsn't math fun?\n\nI hope I didn't make any more mistakes.  I'm already a lame scientist according to some here.\n \nAnd I may be lame.
