I confess I jumped to the revealer when I was stumped by the theme early, and that made it much more fun actually (surprised you knew the movie it’s well before your time).\nI thought the top was pretty easy but I got hung up later on, my own problems. RAVE before FAVE, RHÔNE before RHINE, HBO before ABC, RUTH before OUTS, IRONWEED before IRONWOOD, PRESS before PROSE, NOBAR before NOTIP, I just got bamboozled all over the place. But I like that.

So this is just a Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon story.\n\nMy daughter's grandmother lived in a building on the Upper West Side of Manahattan. There was a boy about her age on the same floor that she often would play with when she visited. I had no idea at the beginning that the boy was William Hurt's son. His mother, a ballerina, tried to sue Hurt in New York, seeking recognition of their relationship as a common-law marriage under South Carolina law. The New York court held that the relationship between Hurt and Jennings did not qualify as a common-law marriage under South Carolina law and found in Hurt's favor that no marriage existed. I don't think the poor kid ever had a relationship with his father.

Props to Zachary, who came up with it, according to the constructor notes.\n\nI love how the process of figuring out the states – from the length of the gray squares and from crosses – helped get the full theme answer it is embedded in.  There was more pleasure in this than just figuring out the theme answer from simply crosses and clue.\n\nI also love how in some areas this puzzle fought me, checked my INERTIA.  Sometimes it was from tricky cluing, other times from no-knows.

After a day of brain work, I was very glad this pleasant diversion took longer than I usually spend. I enjoyed all of it, from the first moment when I saw the grid and thought, \"Ooh! Layers!\" until the last moment when I figured out what the revealer was all about.\n\nIt took a few trials and errors to figure how to deal with the circles. The first couple of things I tried did not help with the crosses, or worse, worked for some but not all. I tried to cram in philadelphiaMINT and gave up, then filled in DRUMcorpS but only some of the crosses were working--so maybe it was a rebus after all? So then I decided to leave those circles alone for awhile. Kind of like a beautiful snake you don't think is poisonous, but really, why risk it.\n\nIt took awhile to trust that the theme was not actually needed for the acrosses or the downs, and then it served the very pleasant function of just keeping me wondering about it until I looked back at the end.\n\nAnd then reading the column and finding out one of the constructors is only 16! This in no way came across as an early effort.

I narrowed it down to my top 5 but added 4 more honorable mentions that I thought were also worthy.\n\n5/25 Dylan Schiff “Travel Bug”\nI’m sure some solvers were annoyed by this theme (WORMHOLES) and don’t like having to jump around the grid, but it is so multilayered (words associated with “worm”, rebuses, long entries starting in one part of the grid and continuing to another) and was so impeccably constructed, astonishing, and fun it’s impossible not to include it. High on my list.\n7/6 Zhou Zhang and Kevin Curry “Escape Room” A polarizing puzzle, for sure, but, in my opinion, a BREAKOUT performance by two of my favorite constructors. Very unique and full of Easter eggs. Reminds me of the lyric from [title of show]: “I’d rather be nine people’s favorite thing than 100 people’s ninth favorite thing.” This is one of my favorite things.\n8/3 Jeremy Newton “Heavenly Voices”\nThis “Star Trek” themed puzzle was a crowd pleaser and probably a top contender. I can’t argue it was out of this world with an astonishing number of themed elements that were entertaining for everyone in one way or another.\n9/14 Daniel Grinberg “Bird’s Eye View”\nArguments on the true transliteration of the Roadrunner’s warning aside, this was a fresh, eye-catching, loving tribute that can’t be ignored.

As a constructor it impressed me tremendously.\n\nHonorable mention\n3/2 Adam Wagner “Rainbow Connection”\nColorful theme (in more ways than one), fun to figure out and solve, with a high level of difficulty but smooth fill.\n3/23 Alan Colin Kirk “Where’d You Go?”\nI’m always a sucker for punny themes and revealers. This one (ITSNOTYOUITSME with the letter U replaced by ME) was fresh, funny, and exciting, with some amazing themed entries.\n9/28 Rich Katz “Central Perk”\nThis tribute to “Friends” owed a lot to the Crossword gods for its symmetry and perfect title, but give Rich Katz his due for its conception and elegant construction. Even non-viewers of “Friends” enjoyed it.\n11/2 Raphael Musa “Open Faced”\nOk, not going to win any awards just because so many people abhor themeless Sundays, but constructing the Sunday grid with the lowest word count in history has got to be at least worth an honorable mention.

My own \"method\" has been to lay the comforter out flat and carefully fold the the sides in until the are a long stack the width of the opening, then slide the comforter through the opening into the cover and unfold it inside the cover.  Unfortunately, there are always glitches when the comforter gets creative and unfolds itself in unexpected ways. That's when I must plunge into the depths and sort it out.  I'll check out the videos next time (next year).\n\nAs for exercise, I get plenty of that, but I forget that I'm not what I once was and have to be careful not to launch into projects that will be risky—e.g., somehow I wrecked my knee as I was crawling around on the floor setting up our new TV soundbar a couple of weeks ago.
