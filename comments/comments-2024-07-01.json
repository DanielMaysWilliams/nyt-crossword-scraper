Once upon a time, in my ill-spent youth, I was a devoted ink & paper person. I later became accustomed to a tablet and the guilty pleasure of deleting. Experimenting  with my phone, I thought the small size and isolated clue display would be more challenging, but my phone solve times are consistently under average (by which I mean not quite as slow…).

In those keys, the keyboard lies under the fingers beautifully and chords are easily and intuitively formed. It was famously the only key Irving Berlin played in; his piano had a special clutch mechanism to raise or lower the sounding pitch while he just played in that one key. The piano is in the Smithsonian.\n\nHowever, _reading_ music in keys with more sharps and flats is more challenging for most players until they achieve a certain breakthrough moment where “everything is relative” - where the score’s meanings become transparent. The same breakthrough allows for transposing at sight to be done fluently — though certain transpositions are always going to be easiest (any flat key to its natural and vice versa, piece of cake) or hardest (C minor down to B minor is no picnic).\n\nSomeone also mentioned horns and trumpets. For lots of reasons, those players can’t get far beyond the beginning stage before already making that leap to not caring what pitch is written but simply understanding what sound is required.","createDate":"1719800600","updateDate":"1719895832","approveDate":"1719851774","recommendations":4,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134291631","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8259539604187012}
