It's so good to now work where they expect me to really vacate on my vacation. I didn't have that for a long time and appreciate it so much now, even after five years here. It's hard to erase the previous two decades but I'm immensely grateful for now. As usual, I digress.

I don't care about streaks, so I didn't feel a pressure, it was just fun. \n\nI enjoyed today's offering! It was surprisingly a personal best. Wonder how good it could have been if I hadn't stopped to sip my Diet Coke or scratch my nose... \n\nToday, I didn't follow my usual across then down pattern, I was on a roll and just did sections at a time, with only a slowdown or two, like NOOB-v-NewB, thinking of carnitas before BARBACOA (easily resolved, though I have a slight taste preference for the former) and PASTASHEet before SHELL. I thought PASTASHEet was not a good answer but one does sometimes roll them with goodness inside, so maybe?

Infrared cameras, basement dance parties, and laser tag arenas: I want to hang out with Spencer Leach!\n\nA note on GAMUT: a while back, I posted a comment on the medieval origins of the names for the notes of the scale--how, before it was Do-Re-Mi, it was Ut-Re-Mi. Actually, medieval music theorists had a system of interlocking, six-note scales (hexachords)--so any given pitch was fully designated by both its letter name (A-G) and its position on the scale: so, B-Mi, or E-La. Also, since the only music worth considering was the liturgical chant being sung by monks, the full compass of notes was that which a (male) human voice can produce (falsetti and boys included): in other words, from the bottom of the (modern) bass clef to the E an octave and a third above middle C. Oh, and there weren't any sharps or flats, except for B-flat. Go figure.\n\nAnyway, you would think that the first, lowest note in this system would be (low) \"A,\" but no--the bottom note (\"Ut\"), on the bottom hexachord, was designated by the Greek letter Gamma--thus \"Gamma-ut\"--hence \"Gamut,\" hence the term for the system as a whole.\n\nHere's a couple of underground dance parties:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oou2ywIbRxc&list=RDoou2ywIbRxc&start_radio=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oou2ywIbRxc&list=RDoou2ywIbRxc&start_radio=1</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtFa34EdgI\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtFa34EdgI</a>\n\n(I know which one I'd rather crash.)","createDate":"1761072939","updateDate":"1761101250","approveDate":"1761072939","recommendations":11,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146092227","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8839466571807861}

How long do we have to wait?\"\nWe're asking that too, even in the midst of our joy. So much of our success was lightning in a bottle -- players suddenly finding their hitting form or rookies succeeding because there was no 'form' on their tendencies, so their pitches were unpredictable. \n\nSo many of our players only got their moment because someone with a bigger rep or better numbers was injured and there was a gap to be filled. No injury, no gap, and that second-rank player would have languished in Buffalo. Some of this year's \"stars\" were throw-ins on deals we made for bigger names. \n\nLuck counts for so much, even for a player with good natural skills who applies himself. And the players know it.  Ernie Clement was a journeyman player six months ago. Now he's among the top 10 hitters for average and is nominated for two Golden Gloves. Where did this come from? He cheerfully admits that he has no idea. He makes a pro forma acknowledgement  of the coaching the Jays gave him, but ask the coaches?

A plane has two, and a point has one. Just thinking about a cone for a moment, the solid shape would be defined by a circle at the base, and the sides connecting the circle to another point, the point of the cone.\n\nIf it were what we think of as a hollow cone in real life, that shape is actually defined by a circular ring and two shapes connecting the ring to the point of the cone: the inside of the cone and the outside of the cone. It's easier to think of these if the hollow cone is thick on the sides, then you can see the circular ring at the base and feel that the inside is smaller than the outside.

For example, the locus of points (x,y,z) in space for which x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 is the (unit) sphere. It is a *surface*, not a solid. If it were filled, I as a mathematician would call it the (unit) \"ball\". Similarly, the locus of points for which x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0 would be a mathematical cone---sometimes referred to as a \"double cone\" since it consists of two nappes.
