Unlike the twists and cleverness of the other themers, pop wisdom isn't a thing -- popular wisdom is -- so it came off as just another name for \"fatherly advice.\" And while Dadaism is very funny, Simeon says in his notes that the editors came up with that one (and it also awkwardly repeats the DAD of DAD JOKES). You can tell from the notes that he's also a little PEEVISH that this puzzle took over a year to get published and that in the meantime another puzzle scooped one of his answers. So, for those of you assuming that Joe Fagliano is the main editor of all these post-Shortz-stroke appearances, think of the long gestation period before this veteran puzzlemaker's effort finally saw the light. I'd be so freakin' peevish I'd be doling out a lot of LOVE TAPS, like Moe does to his fellow stooges.

But it just didn’t feel Simeon-y to me.  I love his puzzles for their how-did-he-think-of-that-and-pull-it-off themes.  This seemed too conventional for him.\n\nSo, when I saw in his notes that the concept he sent into the Times had a tricky gimmick, revealed in the last across answer, suddenly things felt right in the world.  But now I want to know what that tricky gimmick was.  Simeon!  Simeon!  Will you please chime in here???\n\nOh, I adored the clue – [Demos for democracy, e.g.] – for ROOT WORD (Hi, @Pezhead!).  And this puzzle reminded me of my dad, who was not a dad joke teller per se; in fact, he didn’t abide dad jokes very well.  But he continually came out with such funny non-dad-joke lines.\n\nOne example.  He was a nonapologetic carnivore; barbecued steaks were regularly on the dinner rotation.  He loved his meat.  He lived for it.  So, when I told him that vegetarians live longer than meat eaters, his face screwed up in bewilderment, and then, after a beat, he said, “Maybe it just SEEMS longer.”\n\nThank you, Simeon, for a lovely time in the box today!","createDate":"1718191793","updateDate":"1718374127","approveDate":"1718191798","recommendations":28,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133854809","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6866034269332886}

First time commenter! Thanks for the lively comments all! I wanted to clarify a few things from my \"Constructor Notes\" which seem to have attracted some attention in these comments.\n.\n1. I think it's pretty common for an accepted submittal to wait many months before it goes to print. But this puzzle in particular got slated for the week of Fathers Day... so, naturally it had to wait til June rolled back around.  I hadn't meant to imply that the delay in this case was unusual, only to acknowledge a neat puzzle that was published in the interim. \n.\n2. It's somewhat common (in my experience) for Editors to request a change to the way the puzzle plays out. They are always very gracious about it, and of course I had the option not to have them run with it in its present form. Having chosen to accept their request for edits, it was a fun process and I'm excited about the finished product (even if it's a bit different than I had originally pictured it). I'm trying to think of a way to revive the original gimmick for a future puzzle... we'll see!\n.\nThanks for solving!","createDate":"1718223574","updateDate":"1718421460","approveDate":"1718223577","recommendations":35,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133868404,"parentUserDisplayName":"Charlotte","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133869124","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7938795685768127}

To begin, you're not excluded, but let's examine what you're offended by.\n\nBefore Christine Jorgensen, there was no need for a word like CISGENDER. Since its definition means that you're the same sex as when you were born, there was no need back then to have such a word, since you could have just said \"people\". Before there were transgender people, there was no need for a word to describe those who were not.\n\nFor many decades, the number of transgender people was so infinitesimal that those who weren't, i.e. practically everyone on the planet, if they had to be distinguished from the transgendered, were just called \"normal\".  That label was the offensive one, but since people generally unbothered by it, it worked for a long time.\n\nAs it became more common for people with gender dysphoria to transition from one gender to another (and of course, it's anything but truly common, still), a better word was needed for someone who was, like most people, not transgendered.\n\nThat word was CISGENDERED.  The prefix CIS has been the opposite of TRANS for ages.  Words using it having nothing to do with gender or sex include cisalpine, cismontane, cisatlantic, Cisjordan, cislunar, all opposites of words prefixed with TRANS.\n\nCISGENDER is not a slur. The only way you can find it offensive is if you're offended by the need to distinguish people who are not transgendered from those who are.\n\nAnd that's a very bigoted mindset.","createDate":"1718216449","updateDate":"1718462325","approveDate":"1718216453","recommendations":35,"replyCount":30,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133866253","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.672954261302948}
