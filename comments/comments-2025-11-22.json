As a long-time student of Plato, I've heard again and again the phrase \"the GROVEs of Academe\", but I had never bother to investigate it further, other than knowing that Plato created his school in the suburb of Athens known as Academe, hence the origin of our term \"academy\".\n\nIn today's post-puzzle research, I learned that the phrase has its origin in an epistle of the Latin poet Horace: \"Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum\" (\"...and to seek the truth in the groves of Academe...\").  It was then popularized in the modern world in the novel \"The Groves of Academe\", a biting satire about the academic world by Mary McCarthy, in 1951.\n\nI had never thought about what kind of trees were growing in that grove, but Aristophanes confirms our constructor's assertion in \"The Clouds\", referring to the \"Academy, under the sacred OLIVE-trees\" as a place where well-born youth could exercise their bodies to become decent Athenian gentlemen.\n\nSo, a fine puzzle, and a lovely opportunity to enhance my knowledge of the Classical world.

It made me think that the constructors and editors don't know that \"Elia\" is \"Lamb.\" You have to go back to 2014, and before that 2011, to find a work of Lamb's clued as an essay by this \"pen name,\" although several others including Sam Ezersky have played with the pseudonym [\"Lamb, by another name\"]. Still, it's easy to insert \"pen name\" into the clue to provide clarification, just so we all know there wasn't an essayist named Elia.\n\nThe quotation is the last line of Lamb's \"All F00l's Day\" -- which I just read out of curiosity and have no taste for: its highfalutin pseudo-Elizabethan prose set my teeth on edge -- and talk about Naticks -- the essay is full of arcane references that were likely only slightly less obscure to readers of the early 19th century.

A couple of years ago I had gone to a lecture by DOERR (and pulled his name from somewhere).  My daughter had lent me the book by ZINN (whose name was also buried in deep storage).  I guessed NINE for Olivier because I thought that laxity had to end with NESS.  Others I got from crosses that looked possible. The Northwest corner fell last.  I have taken to heart Deb's advice to try the hard puzzles, and I have definitely improved.","createDate":"1763847307","updateDate":"1763898225","approveDate":"1763847307","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146823554","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7713044285774231}

He was almost ten when his health suddenly deteriorated and we could no longer go on the longs walks he had enjoyed for years. Occasionally his condition improved and we would walk 3, 4 or 5 kilometers, but the 10-15 km treks of old had to remain a memory. It was awesome to care for him for the last 4 years of his life - knowing we were doing everything to make him feel as good as possible felt great, and he was not in pain or distress, until the final week or so. I will forever miss that loco lab.\n\nYou wouldn't agree when I last told you I am a bit of a rube.

We got to have them with all our other pups. The Dog had a congenital defect, however; when it was her time to go, it was a matter of days, not years. I miss her goofy face so very, very much. She was a special pup. \n\nThere’s so much good literature out there and we all have our niches, even the best-read among us, I’d venture—and there are some marvelously well-read folks on this forum. I mean, what’s a rube? If being well read within the last decade or even two is the benchmark, I’m definitely a rube. What I read and write about excites about 8.3 people per continent.\n\nIf you get around to Rushdie, I really heartily recommend him. I read a lot of him when I was younger, even though magical realism is a genre I enjoy within limits. But to read him is to savor the writing.","createDate":"1763836757","updateDate":"1763845674","approveDate":"1763836759","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146816428,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146821212","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.534738302230835}

Also, you have to keep in mind my English is nowhere as sophisticated as yours. Your \"writing to be savored\" is my ultimate test of patience. I have read some excerpts of books praised in The Guardian for the authors' use of language, and I have always found them unbearable.\n\nMy idea of good English in a novel is what Stephen King does. It's good old plain English, but used very well.\n\nAlso, above all else I value a good story, and all the critically acclaimed authors seem to prefer form over content - they play with langauge, they reference stuff from all the millenia of human culture, but they usually don't seem to care about the story, in the traditional sense. It's like they think it beneath them to entertain 🤷🏽.\n\nI am a man of quite simple tastes - I don't crave innovation and experimentation, or transcendence.","createDate":"1763839323","updateDate":"1763853989","approveDate":"1763839325","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146821212,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146821904","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-22","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6438573002815247}
