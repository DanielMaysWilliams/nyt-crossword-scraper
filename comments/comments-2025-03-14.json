It was Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (1863–1944), a man of letters now largely forgotten except for his long editorship of the Oxford Book of English Verse. \n\nHe offered his vade mecum, a version of Johnson’s, in a 1914 lecture titled “On Style”: “[I]f you here require a practical rule of me, I will present you with this: ‘Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it — whole-heartedly — and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.’ ”\"\n\n<a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2014/11/spare-the-darling\" target=\"_blank\">https://harpers.org/archive/2014/11/spare-the-darling</a>/","createDate":"1741951375","updateDate":"1742031541","approveDate":"1741951378","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140571210","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7391505241394043}

I think that is indeed what rubbed me the wrong way about it.\n\nAnd an \"athletic\" connection between 'bench press' and 'put me it, coach' feels artificial and contrived to me; more meaningful is simply the pun on 'bench.' But to contrast with one of the 'better' examples I mentioned... reparsing 'ranch dressing' as 'what you might wear on a ranch' (a STETSON HAT) is natural and pleasing, whereas reparsing 'bench press' as...

That's not the puzzle's fault, nor does it make it a bad puzzle.  Every last answer in this puzzle made sense if you understood it, and there was zero garbage.  There was just a lot that you weren't prepared for.\n\nAnd if you looked through the comments, you would have gotten many of your explanations.  I explained REOS twice, and I can only invite you at this point to find my posts on your own.\n\nFridays and Saturdays are supposed to be super tough, and this one was especially tough.  The fact that some people couldn't solve it doesn't make it a bad puzzle.  It's just that you're not there yet. Either keep plugging away, or stick to the easy stuff.
