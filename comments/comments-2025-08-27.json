In fact, I find the “Schrödinger” trick to be the only disappointing piece, because it’s really just exploiting the fact that English uses “up” and “down” interchangeably in many idioms, with either no change to their meaning or a perfectly symmetric meaning. That’s all fair game, but for my money, the joy of these quantum-superposition puzzles is when the same clue can lead to multiple different answers with different meanings. It would have been great to see some answers where “UP” and “DOWN” function as something other than a direction, though admittedly that’s a tough constraint to make work in a rebus. As is, the crosses feel a bit like rhyming a word with itself.\n\nAnyway!

(Evidently, I am late to the party on that one.  Or maybe I arrived at the party and found no-one else there?  Kind of reminds me of the Mad Hatter’s tea party scene.  More on Alice a bit later.). As an aside, I must give Sam full marks for what struck me —- no bias here — as a brilliant bit of writing to introduce me to the concept of a Schrödinger puzzle.\n\nIt got me to thinking about Lewis Carroll’s  Cheshire Cat whose smile persisted after the cat disappeared.  And then a brilliant thought — to me, anyway— occurred.  What do Lewis Carroll and Schrödinger have in common?

Maybe it was the news of all the FEMA personnel who lost their jobs for being critical of the administration. GWB’s praise for his director of FEMA, “Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job,” even as people were still drowning or losing everything they owned, was once a particular low point in presidential awareness but I fear it will pale in comparison quite soon.\n\nEnough of the politics. I enjoyed this puzzle, which I solved 15% faster than my average time..though still quite a bit over the median time on XW Stats. Yet I took comfort in the fact that the average time there was slower than solvers’ averages. If anyone is keeping track of UP v DOWN, the OCD part of me needed to fill UP for the rebuses in the north and DOWN for those in the south. \n\nAnd, for the record, both today’s and yesterday’s puzzles were A-OK in my book.

Whatever works for you is fine by me.\n\nIf I recall correctly, to locate your incomplete puzzles under \"In Progress,\" at least on a web browser on a PC, open the NYT Games page. In the upper left, open a menu by clicking on the 3 horizontal bars. Next to \"The Crossword\" click the arrow to open a new menu and choose \"Statistics.\" I believe \"In Progress\" puzzles appear on that page.
