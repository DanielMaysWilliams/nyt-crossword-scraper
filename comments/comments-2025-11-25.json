Our R.E. agent got us Lamont Dozier and his third wife, Barbara, as our tenants. They moved a ton of stuff into the place —boxes of evening gowns and tuxedos, a grand piano, computers, TVs — everything but themselves. They never set foot in the place. The first year they paid the entire years' rent in one payment. The second year we had to run after them for the money. I was hoping I'd get to meet him and maybe even get a signed copy of one of his albums (he performed, too). Alas, it was not to be, and after the second year they left, cleaning out every bit of unused stuff they brought with them. We figured they were using it as an expensive storage facility as a tax shelter to have a Las Vegas address. It was nice that there wasn't any wear and tear on the house, but the downside was that a leak went undetected until we made a rare visit to check up on the house.

And it most definitely is a storage device, albeit a temporary one. Your ability to access it directly doesn’t change that definition.\n\nHard drives, even SSDs, are slow. If I load up Call of Duty on a Friday night (80+GB game) the game’s textures, shaders, models, etc get loaded into the RAM when the game loads. That’s like a holding area for the info so the game can access it quickly. Then as I play the game engine tells the VRAM (graphics card memory) to pull what it needs from the RAM in anticipation of processing (done by the GPU). The general info that loaded at the start to RAM mostly stays there and then loading screens between match add map specific data to it. \n\nIf RAM was extremely short term or not a storage device I wouldn’t need a minimum of 8GB of it to load/run my game.","createDate":"1764096529","updateDate":"1764142353","approveDate":"1764096530","recommendations":10,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146882959","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7801543474197388}

Full stop. The only thing the clue gets wrong is when it was in use. Julius Caesar and his contemporaries used an earlier, Classical Latin form plēbes (5th declension). Plēbs (3rd declension) doesn’t show up until post-Classical imperial literature, so 100-150 years later. Tacitus uses plēbes. \n\nWas plēbs around earlier—on the street if not in literature? Did Julius Caesar use plēbs when rosy from too much wine? It’s possible; there’s no way to know. \n\nMaybe the clue should have referenced Caligula in lieu of Julius Caesar for philological accuracy, but plēbs as a collective noun meaning ‘crowd’ or ‘the masses’ (the clue did *not* call for a plural, nor did it call for any sociopolitical conclusions) is very much correct.","createDate":"1764058347","updateDate":"1764136345","approveDate":"1764058348","recommendations":19,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146867106,"parentUserDisplayName":"Dave","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146869502","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6327590346336365}

True art is about the connection between the artist, their work, and me, and how the two people and the creation come together in a unique way. Musicals lack any of that subtlety. Musical theater is to music what a certain gaudily gilt Manhattan condo is to the interiors of Palladio's Villa La Rotonda.\n\nOf course, occasionally I need an intellectual and emotional reset, and I achieve it with the help of the cathartic directness of Addison RAE or Doja Cat.","createDate":"1764073130","updateDate":"1764073131","approveDate":"1764073131","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146868198,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eric Hougland","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146871480","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8322821855545044}

I'm certainly not disagreeing with you there -- 95% of the time, I'd use \"storage\" to mean \"a persistent storage layer, backed by one or more non-ephemeral volumes\".\n\nBut that doesn't invalidate the more generic sense of the term!

Does RAM store stuff? \nSort of. RAM is volatile. This means it can only store stuff while the computer is powered. \n\nRAM can be thought of like working memory. I can hold stuff there as long as I'm actively thinking about it (the computer is turned on). once I stop thinking about it (the computer is turned off) it's gone. \n\n2. What is RAM for? \n\nRAM is for holding (storing?) stuff the computer is using now or thinks it will use soon. \n\nThere are four levels of computer memory I'll try to explain with the analogy of cooking Spaghetti Bolognese.\n\n1. Registers/your hands: The stuff actively being worked on. The onion you are currently chopping.\n2. Cache/your chopping board: The stuff being worked on immediately next. The celery and carrots that are to be chopped next.\n3. Main Memory(RAM)/your fridge and pantry: the stuff being worked on soon or in a different app/window. The can of tomatoes on the shelf, the meat in the freezer etc for this meal but also stuff for your next couple meals. \n4. Storage(SSD and HDD)/your cellar, the grocery store: the stuff being worked on at a later time. Stuff for next month's meals.\n\nNot entirely related but fun. The actual access times are far different. If a register is analogous to in my hand then cache (there are actually 3 levels) L1 right in front me, L2 the other side of room, L3 a block away, RAM other end of town, SSD other side of the country and HDD on Saturn.
