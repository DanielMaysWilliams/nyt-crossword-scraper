For example, a French person would never say ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù to apologize. My Italian isn‚Äôt as good as my French, but ... In Italian, you can say ‚Äúchiedo scusa‚Äù (I ask for ‚Äúscusa‚Äù), which makes clear that the ‚Äúscusa‚Äù is something granted by the OTHER person, not by the person excluding themself. ‚ÄúScusa‚Äù is the act of forgiving someone, not an apology. \n\nI think this is a straight-up cluing mistake.","createDate":"1708006183","updateDate":"1708037923","approveDate":"1708006185","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131179262,"parentUserDisplayName":"Anton","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131181418","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.49871811270713806}

From a thorough reading of the comments, it seems like many people's experiences are different, based on what platform they used.  \n\nIf you moved from area to area inserting the doubles, and somehow filled in all of the final area except for the circle, you'll get the music because to the app, either the double or the nothing is correct.  \n\nIn fact, the answer key provided in the column is incorrect because it fails to show the two answers for each circle.  It does not show DOUBLE OR NOTHING.  (It just shows NOTHING.)\n\nThe wonderful site xwordinfo.com shows the solve as it should be displayed (look at it for at least three seconds):\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/15/2024\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/15/2024</a>\n\nAs you can see here, each circle has TWO answers:  A double letter, and nothing at all.  DOUBLE OR NOTHING, very plain and simple.  RILE or RIPPLE going across, and DRIED or DRIPPED going down.\n\nNone of this pretzel logic \"I put a single letter, because then you could double it, or take it away\".  RIPLE and DRIPED are not words; as plain sense entried, they don't work.\n\nThey've allowed one letter of a rebus to count in the past, but not this time. If that's your gripe, that's valid.

I was super tickled to have gotten the revealer with no crosses and then to nail the theme... only, I didn't exactly nail it, now that I've read the Deb's column. \n\nI quickly put in BLO(SS)OM and USSED. I wasn't sure for a while if it would be CUSSED or bUSSED. My husband was bussed to school in inner city Boston, where he grew up, so it made sense to me and I didn't get CSPOTS for a long time...\n\nSo then I thought I had it! I picked up on the two in the south but the NE and NC stymied me until I decided that it must surely be either double letters or nothing at all, which is kind of right only I thought it was double for three and nothing for two of the rebus sets. When I got the happy music, I felt so happy but I see now I misinterpreted it and it worked anyhow for the same reason it didn't work. Or some such! \n\nAnyhow, it was fun and I enjoyed it. Spots like FOG and ROUE crossing  (an R and three vowels stymied me and I had no idea about Karl, but that's a pretty great story!) and most of the NW was super hard for me to work through. But it was really enjoyable and some of the clues that really tricked me were a lot of fun once I got it!","createDate":"1708039407","updateDate":"1708067142","approveDate":"1708039409","recommendations":8,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131196701","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8939104676246643}

Cussing someone out you tell 'em to go somewhere, like \"jump in a lake\" or \"to hell.\" Cussed is a little awkward but I've seen worse.

And billiards is completely different, the table without pockets & played with three balls. What with MASSE yesterday, and the main revealer today, I think the Katz boys might just be some pool sharks. They'd definitely double-team you. And if they bet you double or nothing that they're gonna sink the six ball in the corner pocket, don't take them up on it, because any odds would be LONG ODDS against those two. I've lost many a c-spot to rou√©s like them, in old pool halls, lights dimmed, a fog of cigar smoke massing overhead, a lissome femme fatale with an ash blonde chignon, one bright truss trailing loosely over her nape, plugging a quarter in to put \"That's Amore\" on the juke.
