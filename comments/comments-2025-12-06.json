I’ve been too busy today to spend much time here, but I wanted to say that I really enjoyed this puzzle. I had so few answers the first time through, and the clues all looked very ungettable. But I kept finding little fingerholds (CRAGs?) to build on and eventually wound up finishing about 25% faster than my average.  \n\nSeveral big misdirects. Thought the source of rhythm would be DRUM MACHINE, but was a square short.  Had MEATStainS as the side effect for a BBQ meal. Maybe that says more about me than the puzzle.  \n\nI went with MTETNA for 27 A. It made more sense than ATHENS as the site of a temple for Vulcan, no? And I was pleased to come up with UPSET ALERT for March Madness. I fortunately remembered seeing them crawl across the bottom of the screen.  \n\nTILESAWS was another favorite. Don’t remember seeing that in a puzzle before.  \n\nAltogether quite enjoyable and satisfying.
