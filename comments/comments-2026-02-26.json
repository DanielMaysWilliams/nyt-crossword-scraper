I hope you become famous enough that we can start to use your name in crossword puzzles!\nI’ll be honest I haven’t been as torn about a Thursday puzzle in a long time. On the one hand I liked the theme idea overall and that even once you got the theme, there was a fair challenge to get the themers, either because you had to do math (yay, I’m with you, sorry not sorry) or because you don’t know off-hand the number of Georgian Kings, angles in a chiliagon, or sheets in a ream (CREAMS? DREAMS?). But I HATED the clue for the revealer (and that’s on the editors). I would say most people seeing X and XL would immediately think ROMANNUMERALS as clued before shirt sizes so that just gave away the trick immediately. Why ruin a perfectly good clever theme with such a straightforward revealer?\n\nI was also torn by a lot of the clues. I thought the grid was very decent especially for a debut so kudos on that. Plus it’s a pangram has anyone mentioned that?And I liked a lot of the clues—the SIMILE and PLURAL ones, the twin curry clues, and several others. On the other hand, I wasn’t a fan of UNNAILED as an entry, especially next to what  I thought was a bit awkward clue for GAINTIME. And while I didn’t think the overall challenge was egregious today, there were still just too many unnecessary gimmes. “Long tongued animal” for ANTEATER on a Thursday?

There it is.  A quintessential Thursday.\n\nCrafty theme, slippery and clever cluing, no-knows, all teaming up to create a riddle-fest.  Totally Thursday, IMO, in difficulty level and trickiness.\n\nMarvelous concept!  For me, cracking it brought a very satisfying aha.\n\nIn the theme answers, I love how the marriage of Roman numerals and what they’re counting make legitimate words, so there’s no gibberish in the box.  \n\nI liked seeing a clue that ended in “e.g.” – [Laudanum, e.g.] – echoing Tuesday’s terrific E.G. puzzle.  I also liked the solving experience, a mix of quick-fill areas with brain-loving pesky ones.\n\nMost impressive for a debut, Yitzi.  This was a wow.  What the heck can you follow it up with?

This whole undiagnosed full body nerve pain thing I've mentioned before is getting out of control, or maybe is already well out of control by now. Anyhow, trying a new drug this week and I start PT next week, so that'll hopefully help. \n\nBut anyhow, back to the puzzle, I really enjoyed it! I'm not good at Roman numerals, like, at all, so the revealer was not a gimme for me. Once I got maybe four crosses on the revealer though, I could see the pattern. Fortunately I am pretty good at spotting patterns. Then CINCHES made sense. I still had to work a bit at it and think a little mathy, but the crosses were mostly kind to me and I finished up in better than average time. \n\nFor the theme answers, I particularly like VIKINGSHIP and LIABILITIES. Lots of fun misdirects. Was flumaxed after I removed vaX in the lower left and then realized it was XBOXES... Put vaX back in, took it out, back in,  turned myself around, I did the hokey pokey, that's what it's all about! ☺️ \n\nGood fun! But now it's time to deice myself and jump on a zoom call. Actually, considering aforementioned recent fall and pain issues, I think I'll just gently ease on to the zoom meeting, no jumping for me. I survived the hokey pokey, but now I better be careful!

So, multiple letters, punctuation marks, symbols like stars and diamonds, and our usual Arabic numerals count as rebuses. \n\nUsing regular letters, one per box, even when they mean different things than what they usually do, isn’t a rebus. The fact that they make up Roman numerals does not equate it with using 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. in the squares. If the Roman numerals made up of multiple letters had been crammed into one square, that would have been a rebus. \n\nWhat’s more, calling them rebuses in a column designed to help new solvers is just confusing and counterproductive.
