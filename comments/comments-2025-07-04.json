It's like saying you don't follow soccer, so you've never heard of Lionel Messi.  Or Tom Brady for football.  Or LeBron James for basketball.  But with one divergent fact.\n\nIn baseball, you are expected to be one of two things, a pitcher or an everyday player.  A pitcher plays every five days, generally speaking, or a few times a week in short relief appearances.  Everyone else plays every day.  Pitchers were never expected to be good batters, and a couple of years ago, the designated hitter rule became universal, so nowadays no pitcher ever batters.\n\nExcept SHOHEI OHTANI.  He is both an outstanding batter, having joined the 50/50 club as its only member (as referenced in the clue), and an excellent pitcher, who is just now returning to the rotation after having had surgery in late 2023.\n\nThere has only been one player who was able to dominate the sport on offense and as a pitcher, but he did not do both at the same time.  That man was Babe Ruth.  He was a star pitcher first, and then his hitting prowess made his team realize he'd be more valuable as a hitter, so he stopped pitching.\n\nThe football equivalent would be if Tom Brady were both an outstanding quarterback and linebacker at the same time.  In other sports, there is no equivalent.","createDate":"1751631551","updateDate":"1751713759","approveDate":"1751631553","recommendations":52,"replyCount":29,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143295956","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.662565290927887}

He’s a closing pitcher and he played in the Northwoods League for the Lakeshore Chinooks. He got drafted by the KC Royals the following year and made his major league debut in 2024. He was traded to the Oakland Athletics, then the Seattle Mariners, and this past month was picked up by the Dodgers! My son got to see him pitch two days ago and clinch the win against the White Sox.

There is nothing exciting or elegant about most of the models, to me. I enjoy looking at BMWs and Mercs. Audi? Nah. The S3 is quite nice, on paper, and very fast for its price, but it looks so... Boring. Ditto the RS3. The new A5 is currently offered with poor performance engines over here, at the moment (the fastest has a 0-60 time of 7+ seconds...). A6 and A7 (the only visually appealing Audi, to me) are too big for my needs. A4 has been discontinued.

I know there was someone known \"as the refrigerator\" and there was some coverage of Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan etc playing in the one sport.

When one fails, one falls onto a thick mattress. Bouldering requires technique and strength, and a perfect sense of balance, but typically endurance is not very important. The point is to do the problem in as few attempts as possible. The climbers have 4-5 minutes on each problem for their attempts. Doing the boulder on the first try is called a flash. Janja usually flashes all her boulders.\n\nCompetition lead climbing (as in, leading as a leader does) involves climbing a route on a wall typically 15-18m high. The climber has a rope attached to their harness, given out by a belayer at the bottom of the wall. The climber clips the rope into quickdraws (carabiners, sort of), every 1m or so along the route. When the climber falls, they hang on the rope by the harness. The goal is to get as far along the route as one can without fakling, with the Top being the ultimate point. There is a 6 minute time limit. Endurance is key, but strength and technique matter, too. Janja Garnbret almost always tops routes.\n\nJanja's strength and endurance are outstanding.
