Many of the first few answers were ambiguous enough that the ones I put were wrong and had to be replaced (YEP for YUP, SOAR for RISE, PEELS for PEDIS, MILD for TAME, CCCP for ICBM) and some clues were just a little bit too vague for me to guess without some helping letters (BOW, STAPLER, COLOR, CTSCANS). But there were enough \"can't be anything else\" clues that got me on a solid footing. The puzzle took me longer than the average Sunday, as I said, but it was worth the extra thinking. As a Star Trek fan (don't want to call myself a Trekkie or a Trekker, because I've never gone to conventions or kept collectibles), this puzzle was a lot of fun, but I can see how a non-fan would have a different opinion.","createDate":"1754184218","updateDate":"1754273690","approveDate":"1754184219","recommendations":39,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143994428","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4573812782764435}

I must have seen, purely by accident, one of the first two or three episodes  broadcast, of course at one time once a week, and no do-overs.\n\nTo me (and HeathieJ mentions this below) Star Trek was hope.  This was 1966, and the Cold War was sometimes very, very scary.  We'd just gotten through the Cuban Missile Crisis, which I believe was a major trauma for my mother.\n\nIn another year there was going to be a major Mid-East war.  In the cold war I don't think there were any small wars--all of them could lead to the big one.  The last one.\n\nSo I wasn't really sold that there was any future.  I was firmly convinced we'd never see 1971.  Imagine that:  me, a drama queen.  Go figure.\n\nThen Star Trek happens.  Suddenly a vision that suggests we'd not only get through this, but that there was a future out there where Americans and Soviets worked together on such a magnificent ship on such a magnificent mission.\n\nI chose to believe in it for the same reason I \"believe\" in the Loch Ness monster:  it's more fun to believe than not believe.","createDate":"1754199108","updateDate":"1754283430","approveDate":"1754199110","recommendations":30,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143995304","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5478561520576477}

Poland didn't have Western-style copyright laws until 1994 though, so it wasn't *legally* piracy). The characters - especially Captain Picard - and Star Fleet's values actually influenced who I am as a person. \n\nThen came DS9 and Voyager - I liked them less than TNG back then, but I rewatched them recently and developed a new appreciation for both shows: the human (well, sentient entity, anyway) interest factor of DS9 is through the roof, and as the husband of a wife working in a managerial position in a largely male environment I saw Captain Janeway in a completely new light.\n\nI actually saw the original ST series and the movies with the original crew of the Enterprise quite late, after TNG. The series has a sort of gung ho, Wild West feel to it, very different from the later shows, but I liked it, too. \n\nI never developed a taste for any of the post TNG/DS9/Voyager series. The first of the rebooted Star Trek motion pictures was quite cool though. \n\nI also liked the ST-inspired Orville.\n\nSo yeah, I enjoyed this puzzle a lot 🤩\n\n(I had to look up REAL ID, LTR, RUSS and ANI though)","createDate":"1754201886","updateDate":"1754283213","approveDate":"1754201888","recommendations":37,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143995399","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.893016517162323}

The original series aired in the mid-1960s when network tv would not tackle the themes of racism, sexism, and xenophobia in more “realistic” shows. Gene Roddenberry, and Rod Serling before him on The Twilight Zone, tackled those issues in creative ways and subtly taught viewers the importance of multiculturalism. Including a Russian navigator (Chekhov) at the height of the Cold War always struck me (an idealistic young adult at the time) as brilliant. Hope for a future of cooperation. Spock’s calm composure was a lesson for any child who was ever bullied for physical differences. In Nichelle Nichols (Uhura)’s NYT obituary I remember reading how she traveled the country learning how her character inspired young women and children of color to pursue careers in the sciences.  This was an age when a sexist president (LBJ) signed an executive order trying to eliminate women from astronaut training programs. But that didn’t stop Sally Ride, who often referred to Star Trek as her childhood inspiration to pursue a career in space exploration. \nFandom is one thing, but a tv show that accomplished so much cultural capital deserves all the love this puzzle brings. And it couldn’t come at a better time when the evils of racism, sexism, and xenophobia are stalking the halls of government in this country, while science and learning are being thrown under the bus.","createDate":"1754217903","updateDate":"1754309472","approveDate":"1754217904","recommendations":104,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143995946","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8442538380622864}

I adore the series, but the amount of thematic material that kept popping up was a continual delight.\n\nI think this was the first time I ever figured out a theme after a single word. As soon as I saw the clue for 4A, I knew what this was about, could recognize that shape. Got 3/4 way down the grid, filling in an amazing amount on my first pass, and thought, wow, I'm going to have a fast time. Then hit 90A and went, \"Whaaa? I already have USS up top.\" That was quickly solved, but then I reached the bottom of the grid and saw I had nothing on the last three rows. Just blank. \n\nThen I started on the downs. Got to 3D, saw that the circled squares were supposed to refer to a character, but there is no one in that universe with 29 letters in their name. Finally, when I got to 36D, I knew that had to be SPOCK, and things fell into place. OK, now things will go fast.\n\nExcept--in the midst of easy clues, there were a couple of places that held me up. Haven't read the other comments yet, but having COL__ for Cherry or Lime tripped me up because the \"or\" indicated the answer was single, but surely it was COLas? and 51A was DEbasE?\n\nIn the end, this took slightly over my usual time. And then I had to just sit back and admire it. The density of the theme words, the theme letters, and the theme visuals, this was nigh on perfection.","createDate":"1754236937","updateDate":"1754289696","approveDate":"1754236937","recommendations":17,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144003010","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9446470141410828}
