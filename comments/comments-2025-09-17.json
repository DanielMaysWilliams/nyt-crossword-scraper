While this may be close enough for government work (or crosswords), it's not really correct.\n\nThere's a name for games that are perfectly pitched, and that is--wait for it--perfect games.\n\nPerfect games are much rarer than no-hitters; there have been 326 no-hitters in major league history, or an average of a bit more than two per season, there have only been 24 perfect games, an average of one every five years.\n\nPerfect games are games when no one on the opposing team reaches base in any way; 27 men up, 27 retired.  In a no-hitter, the opposing team can get on base in several ways:  walks, being hit by a pitch, fielding errors, and even catcher's interference.  In fact, a team that pitches a no-hitter can even lose the game, because any of those runners can score in a number of ways: stolen bases, sacrifices, and other errors, to name the most common.  This has happened twice in MLB history.  (In addition, because the home team doesn't bat in the ninth inning if they're ahead, there were three instances that didn't officially count as no-hitters because the pitchers only pitched eight innings.)","createDate":"1758076961","updateDate":"1758171781","approveDate":"1758076962","recommendations":58,"replyCount":32,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145057301","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5187166333198547}

If a pitcher wins a game, we call it a win; if he pitches a shutout, it's also a win, but we mostly say it's a shutout.  If he pitches a no-hitter, it's usually also a shutout and a win, but we focus on the no-hit part.  And if we say \"no-hitter,\" we specifically mean a non-perfect game, because otherwise, we specify \"perfect game.\"  Which is to say, what delineates the usual usage of \"no-hitter\" is that it's NOT \"perfectly pitched;\" if it were, we'd call it a \"perfect game.\"\n\nAnyway, I said from the get-go that it was close enough for crosswords, clued that way in order to make that cutesy little play on words.  Anyone who didn't want to read what I had to say anyway was free to skip over the rest.","createDate":"1758131059","updateDate":"1758152522","approveDate":"1758131060","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145064904,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145071776","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6580403447151184}
