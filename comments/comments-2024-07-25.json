She lived on 23rd St. in Manhattan, in a nice apartment filled with artifacts and her late husband's collection of miniature cast iron printing presses. She and her husband had invented the interrobang -- ‽ -- a cross between a question mark and exclamation point, for emphasizing a rhetorical question, say, or expressing angry consternation, or exclaiming in wonder after witnessing something miraculous. Last time I talked with her, over the phone, she had just finished reading \"50 Shades of Grey\" and that she had thought it a total bore. \"You what‽\" I shouted, and heard her chortle. Hope she's still among the living. She had real mirth.  \n\nNever really thought about MOIST as a widely hated word. I looked into it a little. Yes, a Buzzfeed article dissing moist got 4 million views and in 2012 \"moist\" was voted the most hated word in a landslide in a poll conducted by the New Yorker. Another survey done at Oberlin found that almost 20% of the population hated the word, associating it with unwanted bodily emissions, and that the majority of the people who most hated \"moist\" were highly educated young women.  Others associated it negatively with sex and all that, its chthonic overtones, its Dionysian undertones, and the chief quality of the environment that produces disease, pestilence, corruption and rot. \n\nPersonally, I like all that stuff, as well as moist German chocolate cake.

Got it!”\n\nTerrific theme that he came up with before anyone else.\n\nMeanwhile, lovely rub in clue and answer to escort us into the latter part of the Crosslandia week.  Lovely memories for me among the answers – PETER LORRE, the taste of LORNA Doone cookies, the mirth that the exclamation point after JEB gave me back then, the song ALOUETTE.

So that today I was en route from the kitchen to the living room when I thought to myself: \"CHIPS AHOY!\" has an exclamation point!!!!\"  What better place to think of such a thing than the kitchen?\n\nCHIPSAHOYBANG had really been bothering me.  SHE[BANG] had been so easy to get -- after which I immediately filled in GOES OUT WITH A BANG without a second thought. But CHIPSAHOYBANG????\n\nAha!  Now I remembered.  And I knew I'd seen/heard it from the NYTXW in some previous puzzle.  BANG can be a word for exclamation point.  I have never heard/seen that anywhere else -- of this I'm quite sure.\n\nIt sounds like part of that Victor Borge routine*, doesn't it?\n\nAnyway, the dual BANG/! revealer in the Acrosses and Downs gave this puzzle a wow factor for me that wouldn't have been there either with all BANGS or with all exclamation points.  I had a real \"Aha Moment\" -- although I realize that those of you who have often thought of a \"!\" as a BANG will probably have had less of one.  But I really liked this puzzleBANG.\n\n*If you've never seen it, go to YouTube and look up Victor Borge/punctuation.","createDate":"1721917277","updateDate":"1721941414","approveDate":"1721917280","recommendations":9,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134956590","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5625714659690857}

Here's one more thing I've learned from the NYTXW that otherwise I would have gone to my grave without ever knowing.\n\nNow, I do have a word that is offensive to me both in sound and in meaning. The sound of a word is as big a factor for me as its meaning.  So that while, say, \" hate\" and \"bigotry\" denote ugly things, the words themselves don't make me cringe.  Here are the two words that do make me cringe and that always have. \n\n\"Stink\" and \"stinky\".  I can't stand the sound of them and have never ever used them.\n\nConversely, a beautiful word for me is beautiful in both sound and meaning.  So that \"beautiful\" and \"happy\" are not two of my favorite words because their sounds are not especially euphonious.

I found it interesting that these waters are so common that in the Dutch culture when you go to a restaurant they don’t ask you if you want “still” or “sparkling” water, but rather do you want “blauw” (blue) or “rood” (red) water, and it has nothing to do with the brand of water you are going to get.

I have run into trouble trying to submit comments on my iPhone for the last two days.

I had forgot what an outstanding movie that was; particularly as it was based on a true story of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, who both competed for Great Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics.  Until watching it once again, I hadn’t realized — maybe I am one of the last to have realized it? — that this year’s Paris Olympics is exactly 100 years since it was last held there (although, google tells me that the events are being held all over France — and even in Tahiti).  \n\n“Chariots of Fire” is one of those movies I have watched several times and could never tire of watching again.  Others in that category:\n\nRocky\nBack to the Future (the original)\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nAs to what it is about each of those movies (and probably several others that would be on my list but won’t come to my mind in the wee hours of the morning when I ought to be sleeping), the one thing that occurs to me is the unforgettable musical score in each of them.\n\nAnyone else care to weigh in on movies you have seen countless times and never tire of seeing once more?","createDate":"1721937356","updateDate":"1722045507","approveDate":"1721937359","recommendations":5,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134970613","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5431475639343262}

I know I had run across this in the past, perhaps even in this column, so I looked it up to get some history. Many people have suggested it was coined by Martin Speckter in 1962.

I don't know why, it usually doesn't hold any appeal at all. \n\nThat said, as I get older it changes a bit.  My list of movies I've watched twice because I wanted to is: \n\n-Airplane!\n-Brazil\n-Most Kubrick films \n-Time bandits\n-Planes, Trains and Automobiles\n-Rocky Horror Picture Show doesn't count, as the many times I've watched it have only been in a theater with a very raucous audience (including myself) providing much of the entertainment\n-Maybe a few more that I can't think of. \n\nOne exception to my long time between viewings was the recent first installment of Dune. I loved the books and the 1984 version, so I was primed for it, but, like your choices, I was floored by the music and the sound work in general.  I watched it again a week later.  So good.
