There are plenty of other good puzzles out there that aren’t as demanding or tricky, but the NYT is the only one I pay a subscription for because it’s supposed to be the best. \n\nBefore the Times developed all the other word games that now keep me busy, I used to do several crosswords a day, including the LA Times, the Wall St. Journal and USA Today. They were all good puzzles, and some even ran the occasional special one that got away from the Times, so I know there are plenty of excellent puzzles out there. But the NYT is supposed to be the best. \n\nAnd unlike what some boosters keep saying, it’s not for everyone. If you want an easy or straightforward puzzle every time, you’re going to be disappointed approximately half the week. \n\nAnd I would want least of all for the NYT to start pandering to those who don’t get it and don’t want to get it. \n\nThey say it takes 10,000 hours to get expert in anything. That’s about 28 years if you spend an average of an hour a day in the puzzle. You’re not going to get that good in a few months, or even a year or two.

A mere 66 words strewn with long answers (eight letters and more), not only those six spanners, but there are 18 longs IN ADDITION to those spanners.  And yet hardly a whiff of junk – the skill that this takes!  My heart goes “Ahh!” when I look at the full grid.\n\nThat loveliness is bolstered by freshness.  None of the six spanning answers has appeared in the 80-year-old Times puzzle more than three times, and two of them are debut answers.\n\nBut most importantly, how was the solve?  For me, in this stubborn puzzle, time after time, I experienced one of Crosslandia’s sweetest moments:  When, with few crosses, a vexing long answer suddenly hits, an explosion of “Hah!” and “Aha!”, chased by the thrill of filling in a string of white, spurring an eagerness to pounce on what I just filled in, and a burst of confidence and hope that I’ll crack this beast yet.
