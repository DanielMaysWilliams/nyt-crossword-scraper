Lovely misdirects that worked themselves out. 3D was my way into the grid. As a mother of three, I have definitely UNSNAPped my fair share of onesies 🤣 \nI completed this one last night following an unexpected evacuation warning alert. We are approximately 20 miles south of the closest fire (Palisades Fire), so we were confused as to why we got an alert. We walked out front and several neighbors had wandered out as well to see what was going on. We noticed a plume of smoke extremely close. One of our neighbors had a fire start in their kitchen while they weren’t home. Firefighters were able to cut into her roof and put the fire out within 5 minutes of their arrival. We got a follow up emergency alert that it was accidentally sent to the whole county but was only intended for the Kenneth Fire. It was completely coincidental that we had a fire so close to us. Needless to say, everyone was shaken up. I turned to the crossword puzzle as soon as it came out and it completely calmed me down in a way like nothing else can. So thank you, Robert Logan, for saving my sanity on an otherwise crazy, emotional roller coaster of a day.

I try not to linger on a clue for more than a second or two.  I then do the downs in numerical order.  I may zip through the downs as well, but towards the end of the week I tend to pause in an area if I have some sort of foothold, and focus on that area.  After I've been through all the downs I look for more low-hanging fruit, answers that have more than one letter filled in due to the crosses.\n\nI use the timer, and am happy whenever I get a new personal best, but I do not rush as it ruins my enjoyment.  I am not interested in being a speed solver.  I stopped using lookups shortly after starting to solve online; my interest is in solving a puzzle on my own, even if it takes a long time.  There has been more than one Saturday (and Sunday) puzzle where it took me over two hours to get the gold.

And maybe a little ADD.\n\nA few years ago, I decided to prioritize enjoyment of the puzzle over solving speed. Now I fill in only \"gimmes\" on the first few passes, repeating all Acrosses top to bottom then all Downs left to right. If some Across gimmes are stacked so as to complete a Down, I'll leave one blank to ensure I don't miss reading the Down clue. (The ADD is when I get through several Across/Down cycles and still can't remember some of the crossing clues.)\n\nI absolutely LOVED today's puzzle because the challenge was in the potential misdirects and multiple possible answers. I thought of AARP and STONES on my first pass, but didn't enter them until very near the end.\n\nBecause early week cluing is more straightforward, it usually takes fewer passes to validate my answers, and so the time is faster.
