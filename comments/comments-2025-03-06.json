I remain puzzled. A Sunday from December 3, 2017 by David Steinberg with the title: \"Shell game.\" In that one there were six sets of shaded squares, in this shape: \n\nHard to describe but I'll just capitalize the shaded letters. Here's one example: \n\neLNorte\nAccUse\nWooT\n\nSo the shaded letters read up from the left, across the top and down on the right spell... WALNUT. One other example as entered: \n\n___oSHea\n___AloEs\ntoniC_sWee(pea) \n\nSo the shaded letters spell CASHEW. But that PEA in parentheses was a 3 letter circled rebus. And that was shaded in yellow. And there was one other square shaded in yellow in the puzzle and that just had the letter F crossing: \n127across --\n\"Like hand motions during a shell game.\"\nSWIFT \nand \n128down - \n\"Cook in oil.\"\nFRY (crossing the F in SWIFT)\n\nAnd then there were 2 long answers in the middle of the puzzle higher up above.  Clued as follows: \n\n65a -\n\"The clue for 128-Down, if this shell game weren't a scam\" \nARCTICEXPLORER\nand 86a -\n\"The clue for 127-Across, if this shell game weren't a scam\"\nATTACKWITHAPAW\n\nI have absolutely no idea what was going on there.

Never seen another puzzle like this one - A Sunday from March 7, 1999 by Randolph Ross with the title \"Golly Gee.\" There were about 70 G's in answers in that puzzle. A number of them just answers containing more than one G, e.g (!): \n\nGOODYGOODY\nGOLDENAGE\nGILLIGAN\nDINGALINS\netc. etc. \n\nBut then... there was a string of across answers in the middle of the puzzle, each of them 7 letters and they were stacked with the beginning letter moving one more square to left than the one above. Something like; \n\n____PEGGING\n___GIGGLED\n__BAGGIER\n_NOGGINS\netc. \n\nAnd each of those answers had a double G right as the third and fourth letters.
