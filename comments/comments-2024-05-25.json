Willie's most famous BASKET CATCH was off of Vic Wertz in a World Series game.   You should Google the play.\n\nIn 1957, the evil owner Horace Stoneham whisked the Giants off to San Francisco.  And no one other than Willie Mays ever made a BASKET CATCH after that.  Don't tell me that they did, because if I never saw it, it doesn't count.  After the evil Horace Stoneham took my team away from me, I stopped watching baseball entirely.  Well, I did make a brief attempt to switch my allegiance to the hapless Mets, but it was unsuccessful and very short-lived.\n\nAnd that, Dear Reader, is my very brief history of the BASKET CATCH.","createDate":"1716640491","updateDate":"1716813284","approveDate":"1716640494","recommendations":23,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133454520","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7192326784133911}

Not surprisingly, 'twasnt easy for me. However, though it took me a little over my Saturday average, I didn't use a single lookup or a puzzle check, which I often need on Saturdays! So I guess my experience perhaps supports it being easier, despite my long time. It was fun and I was able to complete it help-free during my MIL's nap--a win in my book!  So again I say, huzzah!  😉\n\nMy favorite was SALAMI for substack. I love being messed with! I also enjoyed BOO BIRDS! I've never heard it before and I thought it was awfully cute!  \n\nThe SE was definitely the hardest for me. Like many, I'd put marinara and had a few other wrong things. Nothing was working out, so finally, as I do when I reach a rather tricky section, I started singing part of the pater song from Only Murders in the Building, season 3, \n\n\"Or, coochie-coochie-coo\nWhat if none of it is true?\nHas my inspection been too cursory?\nShould I look outside this nursery?\nWhat if none of the Pickwick triplets did it?\"\n\nWhen that comes to my mind, I delete all of that section. When I went back, the SR was a good giveaway and the rest filled in. \n\nSidenote, I don't know how often iguana shows up here, but it doesn't seem endangered like it is for the species endemic to our little island second home. It's critically endangered and I hope they are going to be able to save them!
