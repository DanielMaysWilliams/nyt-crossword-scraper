Not that I know anything about BIRD CALLs. As I sit here waiting for the coffee to finish brewing, there’s a bird, er, hooting? outside my window somewhere. It’s done this faithfully each morning since we moved into the house, and each morning for going on a year now I’ve wondered if owls hoot after sunrise. Have I looked it up? I have not, and I’m someone who looks everything up. \n\nLoved, loved the clue for AMERICAN CROW. Currently an expat like Ginny, I also found my last Thanksgiving and 4th of July lacking in proper fanfare. No one was crowding around the frozen turkeys for the former and we flew our flag alone for the latter. Today feels particularly expat-y as I hear the morning traffic in the distance. It’s Pioneer Day in Utah. We should be home, fixing to watch the parade. \n\n[Ahh, yes. That first sip of coffee.]\n\nBack to the puzzle. AMERICAN CROW was a bittersweet reminder of the cawing I used to wake up to when we lived in Seattle. We’d been adopted by a crow, whom I christened Cawrlos. Cawrlos later brought his family—his crow wife Isabella and little Cawrlito and Bella. Those 3 years were the only time I inhaled books about a bird species. Which, I might add, I’d read while Cawrl sat on a branch near me, usually in companionable silence, occasionally rattling or clicking to get my attention.\n\nHow I miss our special relationship. \n\nThank you, Ginny.

It was quite a challenge for me, a lot of words I didn’t know and a lot of bad guesses- ELI before ELM, TAMPA before TEMPE, UNTIP before UNHIP. I thought the theme was clever. But I shuddered to open the comments because there’s a lot to dislike in this puzzle if you are so inclined, I don’t begrudge anyone who feels that way (Frances I hear you and I am dying to hear what Andrjez has to say).  The birds were mostly pretty uncommon for folks who aren’t ornithologically inclined. (And how many people even know what a cooper is these days?) A LOT of very obscure words. I’m not a fan of RAWR either. I think it’s indicative of a relatively new constructor who had a great idea that was a little bit on the esoteric side, and then had to use a lot of obscure crosswordese to make it work. Again I learned a lot and consider it a fine effort, no dis from me.

I'm so happy Benny is doing OK ❤️. \n\nAbout the puzzle:\n\nI enjoyed the puzzle and found it mostly doable, but the NW, NE and SE corners stumped me. In the end I had to resort to several lookups there and elsewhere: OBELI, MELISMA, TEMPE, ABRA (I was missing the R and somehow not getting the clue for RAM...), and CASTE.\n\nSome things I got from crosses only. HEW TO I did not know, and I didn't get the clue for GLASS: shot glass, ok, but glass cut? Cut glass? What is that?\n\nOnce I understood the theme (which was more like a Wednesday than Thursday one, maybe?) I was afraid my unfamilairity with bird names in English would be my undoing. It nearly was! I had no idea SNIPE is a bird. I stared at SN_PE and the cross of SH__, confused. Nothing but an \"I\" made sense there (well, A, maybe? Maybe that guy from Harry Potter was named after a bird? But I went for an \"I\", anyway). Still, not knowing the words SHI(M) or (M)ELIS(MA), I was still lost so I googled the vocal flourish. Not speaking Spanish and being unfamiliar with CLAMs casino style did not help.\n\nSo yeah, it was one of those days when my being Polish and not a native speaker prevented me from solving without outside help.

As @Lewis noted, this constructor's puzzles have already been featured in the games column (her clue for \"LIMO\" was brilliant!). Is \"debut\" used here because this is her first Thursday puzzle?\n\nAnyway, I liked this. A not overly tricky theme, a gaggle of beautiful words (MOCHI, OBELI, MELISMA, CAESAREAN...) and an occasion to have Que SERA, SERA stuck in my head for the day (I grew up with the French version sung by Line Renaud but I think I prefer the Doris Day original!)","createDate":"1753366225","updateDate":"1753383755","approveDate":"1753366227","recommendations":3,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143775822","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5519086718559265}

Only just finished up after some work meetings. This felt like a real doozy in some areas. Much of it came together in good time, including the theme, but there were some crossings that were real bears for me. I worked all of them out except for one, which I could have stared at for many long years and still not have gotten, so it was not what I consider a clean solve for myself. \n\nThe crossing I revealed was 8D and 22A, SHI? and ?ELISMA. I have clearly come across SHIM before because I did all of the 2024 puzzles and it's shown up in there a few times. Must have been easier crosses for me those times. MELISMA was a complete unknown. \n\nAh well, pobody's nerfect! \n\nI had trouble around SITSPAT and VESTS too. I'm still not familiar with SITSPAT at all, but especially as meaning doesn't get hit. But once I finally banished all images of the vestless \"tech bros\" I've known and finally admitted that it had to be VESTS, I accepted that SITSPAT must be a thing. Same with HEWTO. That one made sense to me at least though, when I filled in all the crosses. \n\nAnd to think how clever I felt when I confidently put in a crossword favorite: ELi at 4D.

For the medieval era (for us, 10th-15th centuries) we learn, among other things, by whom, why and how the land was settled: who founded towns and villages? Who lived there? Why did it all make sense?\n\nThe interesting thing is, much of that history is preserved in place names. Many of the earliest settlements were founded by the ruler for tradespeople who provided him with all the goods he needed. The villages were called by their trades. Bednarze (literally, Coopers) was a village where barrels were made, for example. Other names tell similar stories (Bartniki: barć is an old Polish name for a beehive; Szczytniki: szczyt was a shield, etc.)\n\nSo we learned about traditional trades, and knew all their names, even as city kids in 1980s and 1990s Warsaw.
