Could you please clarify:\nIn step 5, should we roll it with the towel BEFORE rolling it with the frosting? In other words, should it be rolled while still slightly warm to set the shape, then allowed to cool in the rolled shape, and finally unrolled and frosted once completely cool? Wouldn’t it be better if the frosting is somewhat chilled when piped so it doesn’t ooze when it’s sliced?\nThanks in advance :-)","createDate":"1737935550","updateDate":"1738005377","approveDate":"1737935551","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139281337,"parentUserDisplayName":"Janis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139281567","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6433359980583191}

This is an answer, usually long and located in the center or lower half of the puzzle, that refers to a hint to other answers. \n\nThis puzzle’s revealer is at 40A. It says [Ignore suspicious behavior, or a hint to the circled letters…]. The first part clues the literal answer to 40A, which is LOOK THE OTHER WAY. \n\nThe second part of the clue helps you understand the theme. LOOK means you’re dealing with words that mean “to look”, and THE OTHER WAY means to enter them “the other way”. Since the normal way is left-to-right, those letters appear right-to-left. \n\nSo in the first theme answer, the circled letters are EPAG, which when read backwards, is GAPE.
