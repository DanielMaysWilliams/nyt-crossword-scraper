The crossing words of any given entry provide different opportunities to arrive at the correct entry.

In a great crossword all of these add up to many well reinforced \"Aha\"! moments.\nThe more routes to solving the constructor provides, the better the solving experience for everyone.\n\nWith that said, if we have had enough coffee and are feeling cocky we will tackle the theme first.

In each inning, the defense has to get three outs. Each turn (or half inning, as both teams must have a turn) normally lasts about five to fifteen minutes. A game takes about three hours. Batters usually wind up having three to five turns per game, depending on how many runners get on base each inning. \n\nThere is a batter’s statistic for runs (scored by the batter) and for runs batted in (RBI), which are runs scoring as a result of his batting (meaning the base runners and the batter himself who were able to score thanks to the batter’s hits). The latter description is a bit of an oversimplification, but I figure you can still get the general idea. \n\nThe pitcher’s statistic is the ERA (Earned Run Average), which is a measure of his effectiveness. Earned runs only because UNEARNED RUNS are not his fault. In this case, as in golf scores, the lower the number is, the better. \n\nAn ERA of 2.00 is exceptional, meaning that a pitcher has given up an average of 2 runs per nine-inning game. Normal is in the 3 to 4 range, and above that, you probably won’t have a job next season. \n\nHope this helps, and doesn’t confuse you even more.","createDate":"1744068801","updateDate":"1744105372","approveDate":"1744068801","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141225218,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141242593","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9234322309494019}

I won't google it to cheat my way out of this, but I think it can be said either sincerely (probably by a nice old lady? ;p) or ironically, by, say, a mean old lady. I'd need context to understand a specific case better. Once I'd have it, I'd come up with a Polish equivalent.\n\nSeriously though, I don't see how that is not translation. Take a simple analogy: translating a poem is done in writing, and not simultaneously, but it involves a whole lotta interpretation: usually a translated poem is very different from the original, because it was translated - and interpreted! - by another poet, who expressed themself in the translation. I know Goethe's Erlkönig in German and in a Polish translation by the Nobel prize winner Wisława Szymborska. It's two different poems, really.\n\nThe whole translation/interpretation dichotomy is a false one, IMO. All translation - except when done badly by underqualified poeple or AI - involves interpretation.","createDate":"1744041820","updateDate":"1744059826","approveDate":"1744041821","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141228094,"parentUserDisplayName":"Kristopher","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141229578","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-07","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6048033833503723}
