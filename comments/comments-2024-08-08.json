Another no helps rebus solved under my belt and I'm loving it! I think this is my third one done without help! I'm almost a year old in crossword years so I'm feeling good about it!

I figure the more I get under my belt, the more capable I'll be with the harder ones. \n\nI was pretty sure at RED-HANDED but I waited because I didn't have the revealer yet and wasn't sure exactly how it worked at first. And then figured it out at UNHAND ME before the revealer. And that helped me get SCOTCH AND SODA and CHANDELIER. \n\nReally enjoyed the clues for GASPS, JOKE, IOU, and EVENT and of course the fun theme! \n\nAlso, for the first time in probably decades, I was talking to someone today about Abbott and Costello's who's on first routine!  🤯  I hadn't yet looked at the puzzle!

The word ricotta means recooked in Italian, and ricotta production involves reheating the whey left over from making other cheeses such as mozzarella and provolone.

In the United States, ricotta production generally uses a combination of whey and whole, low-fat, or skim cow's milk.
