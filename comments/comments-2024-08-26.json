We played a slightly looser version than the printed rules: had a good sized Webster's 2nd International nearby and anyone could use it to make sure a word was spelled correctly, and there were thus no \"challenges,\" but we did believe in the honor system: you couldn't just go fishing for words. It certainly improved my vocabulary.\n\nI think I broke 500 in a two person game just once. 503 if memory serves, but quite often I scored in the high 400s. But I know that at the higher levels, top Scrabble players score 500 like it was nothing. They would ZIP BY me with ease.\n\nFor a while I enjoyed playing online Scrabble on Facebook, because you could actually chat with random people and strike up a conversation. Then they changed the rules, probably because there were issues -- stalkers and creeps and cheaters -- and made it harder to play with any enjoyment. Then Scrabble was replaced with Words with Friends which was not the same. Some of my buddies continued to play online at sites in Estonia, Romania and Russia, and maybe they still do. \n\nLike everything online, online Scrabble got stale, weird, corporatized, monetized, creepy. Thank got all you need is a board, 100 tiles, a pot of hot tea or a couple beers and a bowl of chips, a pad, and a friend and life is good again.\n\nI would very much like to hear from you People of the Word as to your highest Scrabble scores.

I love songs and singing, but I'm terrible with remembering names.\n\nFor example, at 21A, I initially filled in, Tell Me Why!  😂 What can I say, it's one of my favorite Brooklyn Nine-Nine moments!

I play Words with Friends because I have friends who like to, but I honestly just miss the board game!\n\nI also remember the first time I played Scrabble with my boyfriend, now darling husband!
