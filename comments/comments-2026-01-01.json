This is my annual thank you to all of you. I started reading Wordplay on New Year's Day 8 years ago, so I have had 7 full years of daily enjoying the wit and intelligence in the comments. I tend to go down the 'rabbit hole' when someone writes about some topic I didn't know about. Keeps me occupied.\n\nToday's puzzle brought back memories of my 5 years or so of being a PAPER BOY. The routine was to get up at 4 AM and go into the darkness to fold and deliver 50 papers at a profit of maybe 50 cents a day. I don't know how other newspapers handled it but the Des Moines Register charged the PAPER BOY 4 cents for each paper weekly. Then I had to collect a nickel for each paper from the subscriber, so it not only involved delivering in the morning but collecting at night. I survived the ordeal.

And yeah, no clue what’s up with Kyle W. leaving. I’m happy for him that he got snapped up by Michigan right away—I knew him a little bit back in the mid-90s when I dated someone on the team, and he’s a really nice guy—but he is a true Utah man, so it’s a shame what’s happened. \n\nHave you considered reading The Magic Mountain through Kindle or Apple Books? Or getting a copy through AbeBooks? You can do either for about $10 if you choose the Woods translation, and yes, the L-P sounds less than impressive. Maybe you could try your alma mater’s library directly, too, rather than the interlibrary loan through what I’m assuming is your local library. I’m sure all schools carry it since it’s taught in German lit. courses. \n\nThe Internet Archive versions are hit and miss.
