In my first pass through the grid to reorient the keyholes, I noticed I had misspelled AGASSI. Fixing that didn’t help, possibly because by that time, my C CLEF had become a V CLEF. \n\nFinally, on my third time through changing the letters around the keyholes, I hit the correct combination. (Some appear to be the original letters, e.g MEME rather than MEMO; some appear to be the new letters.)\n\nI still don’t whether if I hadn’t misspelled AGASSI whether the keyholes would have automatically rotated to the correct position to spell JACKPOT.

I'm no expert, but I do enjoy a good gimmick.  I thought this was a good gimmick, but that the execution fell short.  I'm glad that I had put in jAM instead of DAM for 104a or the gimmick would have been entirely unnecessary, and only there to show off the constructor's skill rather than to give the solver an extra trick to figure out.\n\nI often have overlays turned off (to make figuring out the gimmick more of a challenge) and don't turn them on or look at the title or look for any notes, unless/until I get stuck.  In this case, I happened to have overlays on from the start accidentally, but after completing the grid (with error) and still not understanding how the locks worked, I clicked on the \"i\" to read the note, after which it became clear and I mentally rotated the letters and figured out that it should be a D at the start of 104a.\n\nHow it could have been better:\n - Every lock should have had *at least* one ambiguous clue that *required* mental rotation in order to disambiguate the answer\n - The cluing was on the whole too straight forward.  There should have been more punny clues (ones with ?s)\n - While it didn't confuse me, the note could have been clearer that only mental (not physical) rotation of the letters was required\n - I think the note should have just indicated that mental rotating of the letters was necessary rather than being so explicit","createDate":"1713704897","updateDate":"1713790982","approveDate":"1713704899","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132689864","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.37966078519821167}

I solved it but couldn’t for the life of me see the theme, find alternate words, or hit the jackpot. \n\nAfter reading so many comments referencing the graphics and animation, I exited the NYT games app and entered the solved puzzle through the NYT newspaper app. OH! Or should I say D’OH! Suddenly all was revealed. \n\nNone of the grid graphics had appeared for me on the games app. There was no animation following the solve. (Yes, the app is updated. No, closing and opening did not work.) While visual aids are not always crucial to navigate a tricky puzzle, they might have been quite helpful in unlocking Mr Schlossberg’s clever theme “combination” of wordplay and rotation.\n\nI’m a big fan of all constructors, and I applaud all manner of twists and turns, even the much maligned rebus. Alas, without the visual clues, this puzzle theme escaped me.

It is so important to recognize and acknowledge the outstanding things that we experience in everyday life.\n\nI wanted to follow up with you from our lively (for me) conversation of a couple of weeks ago. I did manage to fly to Dallas to see the total eclipse, and it was awesome!  For much of the time leading up to totality, the clouds were obscuring the beginning and middle stages of the eclipse (the partial phase), but you could see its progress through the solar glasses as the clouds would part momentarily to reveal the cosmic event taking place, then close again. \n\nBut I was keeping my eye on a blue patch of sky just to the right of the sun, hoping that it would move into position for us. Sure enough, just as totality was approaching, the sun aligned with the hole in the clouds and we could see it all -- the \"diamond ring\" effect just before the sun disappeared, the corona streaming out in all directions, the small red dot of a solar flare at the bottom edge, darkness falling over the landscape, and stars coming out around the sun. \n\nIt was spectacular. Totality lasted for four minutes, which is a very long time for a solar eclipse, and we had a grand view of it all. The experience was made even better by being able to share it with my three-year-old grandson, who dutifully used his solar glasses while it was partial, but who was far more interested in the colorful fish in the nearby koi pond!","createDate":"1713714080","updateDate":"1713862780","approveDate":"1713714083","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132686892,"parentUserDisplayName":"sotto voce","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132694422","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9504528045654297}

The trick is that when you turn the lock (in your mind) 180 degrees, BLASE can be BLAST and TARP can be EARP. Each lock works similarly but at different angle rotation. \n\nThey all have to spell valid words, though they are not answers for the clue, after turned. So, EARP is not a sheet under a tent, of course, but they have to be valid words. \n\nAlso, a lot of people mixed up jAM and DAM at 104A, so you might want to check that if you didn't get happy music.","createDate":"1713734221","updateDate":"1716578908","approveDate":"1713734224","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132700323,"parentUserDisplayName":"Darcy V","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132700635","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6176174879074097}

I’m not sure the puzzle completely justifies this because, for example, if you had never heard of STAB for pain it could be STAG or STAT and it could rotate into -OLD and work.

First off, any gimmick which requires a 53-word preliminary explanation is needlessly complicated and contrived. The grid art--all the circles within circles and shaded squares made it difficult to read, not to mention navigate with a cursor, as I am solving on a laptop. The new words formed from the rotated letters seemed completely random, and, in a dialect where the strings M-A-A and F-O-M-O are Valid Crossword Answers, the whole notion of \"validity\" is called into question. Why not PBT and JARP? I'm sure I could find a way to clue those: ([To break, as an Easter egg]). By the time I ran the Qwerty at EL_OWL and _OMO (Neither elms nor elk are common in the SW--why didn't I see \"elf\"?) and got the Happy Music, I was in such a snit I didn't even care about the circled letters. Anyway, the irritating grid art was made all the more irritating by the animation, sorta like the sensory overload I feel when walking through a casino. (Have you ever noticed that the bells on slot machines are all tuned to the same key? If they weren't, the cacophony would drive off even the most addicted gamblers.)\n\nTo alleviate my mood, I will turn to a 7 minute concerto brought to us by the Jacobs School of Music at IU Bloomington, suggested by two of the entries--but which? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCFnzSCzoYA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCFnzSCzoYA</a>.","createDate":"1713702075","updateDate":"1713822358","approveDate":"1713702079","recommendations":25,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132688771","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-21","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6718021035194397}
