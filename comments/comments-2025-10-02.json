Impatience and limited intelligence were to blame: I never waited long enough to get the data to extrapolate the positions of the mines from, and I also didn't bother to take into account the data I already had. Thus, I clicked on mines way too often for the game to be fun, so I never played it much. I preferred Solitaire 🤣.\n\nI had to wrestle with the fill in places. I didn't need lookups in the end but I still don't understand some stuff. What is a DANISH and a BEAR CLAW? I only know the literal meanings of both words, and I think danish may be used to describe some dairy spread?\n\nI'm about to walk to take Lucyfer the puppy to the groomer for our 8 AM (CET) appointment.

I was a French language editor at Microsoft in 1990 when Minesweeper was released, and I have fond memories of so much wasted time getting a thrill out of the 3D imaginary tactile nature of the game... neglecting my NYT newspaper edition crossword in the process... I'm amazed this theme has never happened and am so grateful to Aidan for somehow knowing how delightful it would be for so many of us.

At one point, one of the characters asks to go back to her childhood, and she gets transported back to the kitchen of her childhood home, where her mother is frying bacon.  In this production, the actress playing her mother is frying actual bacon, and you hear the grease spitting and you can smell the aroma of bacon cooking as it fills up the room.  As an adult, I never cook slabs of bacon, but my mom did for weekend breakfasts when I was little, and the smell and sound of bacon cooking opened up an association and a memory that I didn't know I had.\n\nSo, for me, this is the puzzle of the year.

If I am inclined to defend constructors it’s because—I want to support them to continue to give me hours of enjoyment, when I personally feel they have; sometimes people don’t understand the technical restrictions facing them; I want to promote types of puzzles I enjoy so they continue to be created; and I’m a human being who doesn’t like to see people’s feelings hurt so try to prop them up when I can. I have no issue with reasoned criticism, or even unreasoned when it is directed to, as Barry said, “the product”. Although I will say it mystifies me when people say “I hated this puzzle” with no further comment. What’s the point? I don’t know whether editors take the time to read this, but I know constructors do, and if I saw comments directed to certain clues or types of construction that are frequently criticized I wouldn’t hesitate to try to avoid them. I know as a constructor I am much more sensitive to Naticks now because of these comments and I avoid OCTOPI within an inch of my life.
