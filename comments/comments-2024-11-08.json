My father, a college professor and former high school principal, went to parent teacher\n night the third time it showed up on my reading list, and accosted the teacher who had assigned it.  In consequence, those in the class who were bored of the Flies, were instead allowed to read On The Beach, a similarly apocalyptic story.  The unintended consequence of my father’s action was that I got the lowest grade in that class that I received in my high school career, retribution from the assuredly irritated teacher.\n\nSeeing GIL Scott-Heron cheered me up a bit.  I was reminded that:  “The revolution will not be televised. It will not be brought to you by Xerox in four parts without commercial interruptions.” And thinking of his other most famous piece, which I won’t name here for fear of running afoul of the emus, put me in mind of how to contextualize those who are obsessed with colonizing Mars.","createDate":"1731063197","updateDate":"1731085502","approveDate":"1731063200","recommendations":19,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137452117","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.614980936050415}

Along with pots de crème, lemon curd, and crème anglaise, etc.\n\nIn that work, Mr. Amendola doesn't mention tres leches at all.\n\n*The Baker's Manual* is one of the few cookbooks I would actually recommend, for professional or home use.\n\n***\n\nWell, I guess I've crossed the digital picket line. \nIf I may opine all curmudgeonly for a minute, one of the strikers' demands bothers me as egregious overreach--and I'm not talking about \"pet bereavement.\" I have little sympathy with employees who demand that they be able to \"work from home,\" and complain when they are required to be present bodily in the office. (And better quit now, lest I say something that many would take as truly insensitive.)\n \nBut of course, \"work from home\" has never been an option for me: it's rather difficult to fax a cheesecake or tres leches into the hotel from home. \n\nAnd FWIW, I *have* stood on a picket line, for a month in late fall. One of the hardest things I've ever done, even harder that work, but one which, should the situation demand, I'd do again.

Even the teachers were working remotely at first; later, they came in and students had the option of learning remotely.\n\nThere was nothing I did that couldn't be done from home except on the day of and right before the exams, when I had to prepare the rooms and administer the exams.\n\nOnce school started up in the normal sense that fall, I was the only one who could do his job from home.

Yet, unlike a round Wok, the flat bottom Wok has a flat base, allowing it to sit steadily on any cooking top, including an induction stove.\n\nThis version of the Wok was invented in 1971 by Joyce Chen, a Chinese-American immigrant. Seeing how challenging it was to use the traditional Wok in the average American home, Chen patented the flat bottom Wok. Since then, her version of the Wok has become the dominant type of Wok found outside of China.\n\n <a href=\"https://madeincookware.com/blogs/round-vs-flat-bottom-Wok\" target=\"_blank\">https://madeincookware.com/blogs/round-vs-flat-bottom-Wok</a>","createDate":"1731093076","updateDate":"1731114658","approveDate":"1731093080","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137462608,"parentUserDisplayName":"Amanda","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137467242","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7965872883796692}
