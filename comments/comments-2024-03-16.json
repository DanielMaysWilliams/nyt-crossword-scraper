Frequently in representations of *rural* speech  [emphasis added].\n\nThe buyer says: “That’s a fine pig you have there, Mr. —“ (giving seller’s name). “Ar, powerful fine pig.” — H. Belloc, in Independent Review, p. 208 (1905)\n\n“Ar,” Launce said contemptuously. “You got a gut-ache or you’re coming out in boils.” — K. Tennant, Lost Haven, vol. 89 (1946)\n\nCity Gent: “Ah, lovely isn’t it?” Rustic: “Ar, ‘tis that.” — G. Chapman et al. Monty Python’s Flying Circus (1989) vol 1. ii. 15\n\n“Ooh, big houses them,” Dolly cooed. “Decent size, ar,” agreed Pop. — K. Aldridge, Pop, p. 210 (2001)\n\nIt seems that “ar” is more typical of the English countryside than the Spanish Main. I believe that the notion of \"ar\" as piratical began with Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver in the Disney film of Treasure Island (1950). RLS didn't provide Silver with a back story, but rural boys going off to sea when their elder brothers inherited the farm were part of the picture back when.","createDate":"1710557466","updateDate":"1710632350","approveDate":"1710557468","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131886929","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8712849020957947}

For one thing, I've seen and been served, and even have served others burgers on BRIOCHE BUNS, but I've never given much thought to putting brie on a burger.\n\nFor one thing, I don't see it as a particularly good choice for a burger cheese.  Sure, it melts well, but I don't think the flavor pairs well with beef.  Still, if you Google \"brie cheeseburger\", you do find a lot of recipes for it, and even a few restaurants that serve one.\n\nSo I guess it comes down to this: just as some cheeses don't pair well with meat, some words don't pair well with each other.  We say \"Swiss cheese\", \"cheddar cheese\", \"American cheese\", but you're not as likely to say \"Brie cheese\".  You'd more commonly just say \"Brie.\"  (As in \"baked Brie\".)  Much like you might say \"tuna fish\" or \"codfish\", but not \"salmon fish\" or \"mackerel fish\".  \n\nI mean, you COULD say \"Brie cheese\", but generally you don't.

In actuality, the Jewish religion does not involve blood of any sort in any ritual, and Christianity of any sort does not figure into Jewish practice in any sense.)\n\nI don't see what she's talking about, either, but I assume it may have something to do with GEIGER.  However, Hans GEIGER, the inventor of the GEIGER counter, was not the person who comes up if you Google \"GEIGER blood libel\".  That would be Abraham GEIGER, a Jew and a rabbi who lived almost 100 years before Hans, and of course he wasn't the one responsible for the so-called blood libel.\n\nHans, who was a German gentile during the Nazi era, doesn't seem to have any connection to blood libel, either.\n\nUnless the OP was referring to Nic CAGE or Ijeoma OLUO...Nah.","createDate":"1710591684","updateDate":"1710766442","approveDate":"1710591687","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131889570,"parentUserDisplayName":"Classic Hip-Hop Fan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131889997","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-16","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.518093466758728}

He is taking time to recover, and in the meantime Joel Fagliano will be filling Will’s role. Starting with the March 14 puzzle, you will see Joel’s byline on top of your daily crossword.\n\nJoel worked as Will’s intern for three summers before joining him as a full-time puzzle editor in 2014. Since then, he has grown into an impressive editor in his own right. He also has the support of a strong editing team of editors, who will take on some of Joel’s regular work while he edits the daily crossword and variety puzzles. Together, we will continue to deliver best-in-class puzzles as Will recovers.\n\nAs always, thank you to our community of puzzlers for your patience, support and well wishes.","createDate":"1710562281","updateDate":"1722597223","approveDate":"1710562283","recommendations":41,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131887602,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131887715","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9285011887550354}
