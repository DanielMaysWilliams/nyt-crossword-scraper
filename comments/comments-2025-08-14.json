For example, in the category Summer Olympics Cities, the clue might be, \"The most recent one\", and the player would have to say, \"What is Paris?\"\n\nThe bracketed first part of each theme clue in this puzzle is what the contestant says to the host, Ken Jennings, to select the next clue.  The higher the dollar amount, the harder the question, supposedly. The jeopardy is that while the dollar amount is added for a correct answer, the same amount is deducted for an incorrect one, with negative totals possible. \n\nMost questions are open to all three players, but a few questions are called Daily Doubles, which can only be answered by the player in control of the board, and that person can wager any amount up to their earnings total.\n\nTwo rounds are played, with the dollar amounts double in the second round. The game ends with one \"Final Jeopardy\" question in which players can wager any or all the earnings they have. The clue is revealed, and the players have 30 seconds to write down their question.  \n\n\"Jeopardy!\" is on in the early evening Monday through Fridays, with new shows for all but about six weeks in the summer.  It's very popular with people who like trivia, so it's perfect for cruciverbalists.\n\nHere's a sample:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NrMKd1OHo\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NrMKd1OHo</a>","createDate":"1755194455","updateDate":"1755205631","approveDate":"1755194456","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144279878,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144283363","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8861995339393616}

They have a lot of organic phosphate available to rapidly regenerate ATP when needed, and other energy reserves to be tapped when those run out.\n\nBut for actual storage of energy, you can't beat lipids and polysaccharides -- fats, glycogen, and starches, and a few other molecules. \n\nI always taught my students to think of ATP as the energy *currency* of the cell, much like the money you might keep in your pocket. Bulk energy storage would be more analogous to a bank account. You can draw from your bank reserves (say, glycogen) when needed, and when you had some excess money (say, ATP), that is where you would put it. Most people don't keep their entire net worth in the form of currency, just as most cells don't keep their entire energy store in the form of ATP.
