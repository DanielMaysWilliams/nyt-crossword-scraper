Or two l0-letter answers and two 9-letter answers.  Or any other combo that matches up two and two.  This is because of the rotational symmetry required in puzzle grid-making.  \n\nAs you may know, I don't create the grid myself when I co-construct  a puzzle.  That's above my pay grade.  But when I come up with a theme idea, I won't send it to a potential collaborator unless I have already come up with theme answers plus a revealer that fulfill the symmetrical requirements needed to make a grid.  These can always be changed: my collaborator and I may find ways to improve on the theme answers I've suggested -- but I'll never forward a puzzle idea with themers that don't conform to the grid requirements for rotational symmetry.\n\nSo that for Andy to come up with three food-plus-golf club themers -- a double bit of wordplay really tough to find, btw -- along with the perfect  revealer all of which fulfill the grid symmetry requirement -- well, that's a coup worth shouting \"Eureka!\" over.","createDate":"1722893759","updateDate":"1722897489","approveDate":"1722893762","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135218208,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135222293","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6612280011177063}

If I had spent more time in casinos I would have realized that waffles were not a common icon.\n\nOTOH, waffles, and lemon meringue and cherry pies--sliced, plated, covered in plastic wrap, and on display in the Traulsen cooler--are common menu items in greasy-spoon DINERS. Along with eggs, and, if you stay around long enough for the lunch menu to kick in, cod fish 'n' chips. Although the one I frequent serves an excellent Blini Demidoff, and a half decent cup of latte.\n\nGood weekend for keyboard technicians: by now, all our instruments should be in perfect intonation.
