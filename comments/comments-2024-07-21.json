It did so in spades, and I therefore found it one of the most entertaining Sunday puzzles in a long time.\n\nI adored the clues and knew they were all examples of one LOGICAL FALLACY or another.  I hadn't, however, heard of all of their names.  CIRCULAR REASONING, SLIPPERY SLOPE and CHERRY PICKING were easy, though I did need some crosses for all of them.  APPEAL TO AUTHORITY is a familiar phrase to me, but not in that context.  And NO TRUE SCOTSMAN and POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC (even though I studied Latin) were great big \"Huh?s\" to me.  I'm assuming the latter means something like \"after the fact reasoning\".\n\nAs for NO TRUE SCOTSMAN?  The longer I sit here writing this, the longer it will be until I find out exactly what that means.  And I'm dying of curiosity.  So I'll finish this up right now.\n\nGreat fun, John Ewbank.

It gets tiresome sometimes to see even very smart people writing \"And this begs the question...\" when they simply mean \"And that begs for us to ask the question\", \"demands that we ask\" etc.\n\n*I just got back from a quick google to doublecheck and oops Merriam-Webster says it's a OK to use \"begging the question\" in this common usage.

Re Merriam-Webster (whom actually I like a lot, their Twitter presence has so often been delightful, impish, witty) I wouldn't mind so much if their irregardless entry was (just to indulge me):  \n\nirregardless         adverb\nir-re-gard-less\n‚Ä¢ nÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂sÃ∂tÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂aÃ∂rÃ∂dÃ∂ oh who're we kidding, HERE\n\nirregardless         adverb\nir-re-gard-less\n‚Ä¢boorish\n‚Ä¢grating\n‚Ä¢worse than 'nucular', 'disorientated' or even \"Whom does that?\"\n‚Ä¢grating as fingernails on a chalkboard\n‚Ä¢GLAAAAAHHHH\n___\n\nBut yes, the Begging the Question thing I'm not really adamant about now that I've read M-W's take‚Ä¶ & the phrase DOES lend itself very nicely to its common-use meaning. There used to be a website beggingthequestion .org/net/com which gently, non-snootily, explained the \"real\" (or at least original) meaning of the phrase, but as I can't find it maybe M-W's take led them to dissolve the site!\n\nRegardless, I do acknowledge evolution of language. With the exception of the above irrabomination.\n\nFor a delightful short story that plays w/the whole concept of language generation‚Äî it's a short \"SF\" (fantasy) story by Connie Willis that's really a screwball comedy‚Äî I highly recommend \"Blued Moon\". It's more about language generation than language evolution but it's really fun. The Moon! It blues!","createDate":"1721585751","updateDate":"1721690783","approveDate":"1721585754","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134835303,"parentUserDisplayName":"Becca","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134838552","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6595315933227539}
