And brought back a memory...\n\nAbout 8 or 10 years ago, when I lived and worked in Milwaukee, a movie was being filmed on the east side. I received a call asking for permission to film part of it in our facility (I worked as the director of marketing and communications in a senior living care complex). After some discussion with our senior staff, we decided to allow it.\n\nOn the day of filming, the star of the show walked in, and our gruff and grim security staff turned into mumbling schoolchildren as they stumbled to their feet (I thought they were going to salute!) to greet Sean ASTIN, making his way to the elevator. Addressing him as Sir, geeking out over his resume (\"I loved you in Rudy!), all but asking him for an autograph...\n\nI guided him to the elevator and apologized for them on our way up. He was obviously very used to it, and very gracious. \n\nOh, the movie? \"The Surface.\" Don't bother. The highlight of the movie is seeing my name and all our staff who got used as extras mentioned under the thank-you section in the credits.
