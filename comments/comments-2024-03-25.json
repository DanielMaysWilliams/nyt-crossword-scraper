(The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres have already completed a two-game series in South Korea.)\n\nIn baseball, the defensive players are the ones positioned in the field.  In this capacity, they are called FIELDERS.  The PITCHER, who throws the ball to the BATTER, is one of those FIELDERS.  The CATCHER, who crouches behind the BATTER to catch the ball if the BATTER doesn't hit it, is another one of the FIELDERS.  \n\nThe BATTER is the only offensive player on the field until one of them gets on base.  Then, the BATTER is a RUNNER.\n\nOne of the odd things about baseball (I believe cricket shares this characteristic) is that unlike other sports, the defense has the ball.\n\n\nAfter reading those constructor's notes, I was picturing a beer league (a recreational league sponsored by local bars) in which the BEER PITCHERS pitch to the BEER BATTERS.\n\nPS: To our British solvers, sorry that JACKET POTATO was too long for 3D.","createDate":"1711318477","updateDate":"1711412129","approveDate":"1711318479","recommendations":30,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132068407","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8504631519317627}

Remember,  this was when Fiske famously seemed to wave the ball to hit the foul pole. The moment is preserved on YouTube, but the back story is that there was a Fenway Park rat involved here.

Still, it is also true nations have national sports, and baseball is not it, in Poland. Almost nobody plays baseball here, because nobody is taught it and we have no infrastructure for it. There is a soccer field in almost every town, and there are quite a few volleyball and handball arenas. There is also no baseball on the nationally popular sports channels. Basicly, there is no way for an average Polish person to get into it, so almost nobody does. Under such circumstances, and due to the lack of similarity of baseball to any sport popular here, it remains a mystery to us, and a quite arcane one at that.\n\nActually, I played some baseball game (it was too long ago for me to remember the name) on an Atari 130XE in the 80s, with my best friend.
