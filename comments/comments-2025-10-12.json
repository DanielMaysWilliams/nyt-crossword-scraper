Wow! So it *can* be done 🤷🏽\n\nI mostly enjoyed the solve. I figured out the theme on my own even though the imperial measurements used in it are largely alien to me. \n\nI struggled with the fill in two or three places and had to resort to several lookups, especially around the MERC spot. That entry alone caused me problems. To me Merc is a Mercedes - that's what we call it for short in Polish (we just pronounce it [Merts]), and I've been hearing it in English-language car shows for decades, too. I'm familiar with the brand Mercury, and I guess I had an inkling it became defunct, but my mind just could not accept Merc could be anything other than a Mercedes. I did not know the etymology of ABBOT, either, or any type of sax other than alto. Neither was I familiar with SPINROOOMS. All that wreaked havoc in that area for me. I was so confused I had to turn to Google for help.\n\nElsewhere I had WILe for the coyote, and the American sport cross did not help me in spotting the mistake. I wasn't really comfortable with that square though so I changed the e to a Y and got my gold star.\n\nIt was not a bad puzzle. My struggles were Andrzej-specific.","createDate":"1760236460","updateDate":"1760315701","approveDate":"1760236460","recommendations":32,"replyCount":15,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145888180","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8486494421958923}

In this case, phonesthetic reduplication favors the ‘il’ of gild echoed in the ‘il’ of lily. \n\nWith “the proof is in the pudding,” I agree that it’s somewhat nonsensical in modern usage, but that’s only because we think of pudding as a dessert. In the 17th c., when the original, “The proof of the pudding is in the eating,” was first penned, the pudding in question would have been a sausage; encased, presumably, in that shiny shrink wrap sausage lives in. So, ironically, our modern shortened “the proof is in the pudding” would still have worked for a food whose outer appearance gives little clue as to what’s on the inside. \n\nLanguage and psycholinguistic phenomena: Who needs Netflix, right?","createDate":"1760277464","updateDate":"1760315450","approveDate":"1760277464","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145890366,"parentUserDisplayName":"Post Mortem","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145892704","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5657382607460022}
