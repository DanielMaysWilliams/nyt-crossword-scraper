The correct term is videotape. My undergrad degree was in Radio-TV-Film, but I mostly studied TV production. \n\n24A WEAR IN is also suspect to my ear. You “break in” shoes and you wear clothes, especially jeans, until they’re nice and soft. But “wear in”? (Confession: Most of my clothes are past being worn in and are virtually worn out.)\n\nI hate trying to make sense of long Down answers, and what little I knew about 15D O PIONEERS! didn’t have the setting any more specific than “the American Midwest.” So I had a difficult time making sense of that. \n\nBut even after fixing the NE corner, I still had an error. I finally saw that 77A wasn’t YES It is but YES I DID. That’s what I get for not checking 62D IN A DEAD HEAT. (55D SALADIN didn’t look too wrong with a T instead of a D.)\n\nA few years ago, I put on a denim jacket that I hadn’t worn in a while. In the pocket, I found a ticket stub from an arthouse cinema here that closed around 20 years ago. It didn’t say what movie we saw (and we saw a lot of movies there in the 1980s and ’90s). My husband thinks it might have been an installment of Matthew Barney’s “Cremaster” cycle.","createDate":"1717301372","updateDate":"1717426023","approveDate":"1717301375","recommendations":13,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133624331","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6317558288574219}

TIL of a minor character named CECIL in The Simpsons with an interesting back story. Kelsey Grammer voiced the character Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Ph.D. aka Sideshow Bob. Many have drawn parallels between Sideshow Bob and Grammer’s similar portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane in Cheers and Frasier. Of note, in that latter show Frasier had a younger brother Dr. Niles Crane portrayed by David Hyde Pierce. Seems in The Simpsons, Sideshow Bob had a brother CECIL, voiced by no other than Pierce.
