Then he did a better pickoff move, and it was close but the runner was clearly back on base in time.\n\nThe third time he used one of better pickoff moves, and it was an incredibly close play at first, with the runner diving head first back to the base.

A rare thing indeed 😀\n\nI liked this puzzle. I solved it in typical Tuesday time, and it offered just the right amount of resistance - it was mostly easy, but there were several pleasantly challenging spots. Personally I perceived the grid as perfect Tuesday difficulty.\n\nFALCON reminded me of the theme song from the Polish tv series \"Pan Wołodyjowski\" (\"Sir Wołodyjowski\"). The series was a 1960s adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz's historical literary epic of the same title. The protagonist, Jerzy Michał Wołodyjowski, portrayed by beloved actor Tadeusz Łomnicki, was a master Polish swordsman, an officer in the Polish army in the middle of the 17th century. For his stature he was called the Little Knight. There is war, love, betrayal, and honor, and the setting is the Ukrainian steppe (at the time, the lands of modern Ukraine were within Polish borders). The theme song, a beautiful ballad composed by the famous Wojciech Kilar, and sung by the actor Leszek Herdegen, describes the steppe as so big even a falcon can't see it all from up high: \"W stepie szerokim/którego okiem/nawet sokolim nie zmierzysz/stań, unieś głowę/wsłuchaj się w słowa/pieśni o małym rycerzu\" (In the wide steppe/which even with an falcon's eye/you cannot measure/raise your head/listen to the words/of the song of the little knight.\"\n\nPS.

Satchel had a very, very good fastball. But he threw me a little breaking ball, just to see what I could do, and I hit it off the top of the fence. And I got a double. When I got to second, Satchel told the third baseman, 'Let me know when that little boy comes back up.'\nThree innings later, I go to kneel down in the on-deck circle, and I hear the third baseman say, 'There he is.' Satch looked at the third baseman, and then he looked at me.\nI walk halfway to home plate and he says, 'Little boy.' I say, 'Yes, sir?' because Satch was much older than I am, so I was trying to show respect.\nHe walked halfway to home plate and said, 'Little boy, I'm not going to trick you. I'm going to throw you three fastballs and you're going to go sit down' and I'm saying in my mind, 'I don't think so.' If he threw me three of the same pitch, I'm going to hit it somewhere.\nHe threw me two fastballs and I just swung...I swung right through it. And the third ball he threw, and I tell people this all the time, he threw the ball and then he started walking. And he says, 'Go sit down.' \nThis is while the ball was in the air.\nHe was just a magnificent pitcher.\"\n~Willie Mays Comes Home\nGQ Magazine interview 2010","createDate":"1754386195","updateDate":"1754432804","approveDate":"1754386196","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144039871,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144041901","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.75328528881073}

When there was no one to play with, he invented a game, running in a huge circle, grabbing a ball and pitching it high in the air, while he kept on running full tilt.  If he missed, he threw us an embarrassed glance, hoping we hadn't noticed, and kept on racing.\n\nOnce, when I was having a rough time—feeling really sad and unwilling to talk to anyone about it, Phipps came into the living room, where I was sprawled on the couch,, took one look at me, walked over, and calmly put his head on the pillow beside mine.

Essentially, out earliest recorded history starts in the mid-10th century CE. Two strong rulers put Poland on the map, but then several centuries of decline followed. The kingdom regained power in the early 14th century, and by the end of the century Poland united with Lithuania when the Lithuanian Grand Prince married the daughter of the last king of the Polish Piast dynasty, and his heir. Wars with the Teutonic knights doninated the 15th century. Poland grew in power, especially in the 16rh century, a time of great prosperity. Disastrous wars in the 17th century - with Sweden, Ukrainian Cossacks, Turkey - ruined the kingdom (it was called a Republic by then, but there still was a king). While absolutism developed elsewhere in Europe, the Polish kings were weakened by the growing power of regional magnates. The country was so weak by the end of the 18th century that Austria, Prussia and Russia divided it between themselves, almost without a fight. Poland reemerged in 1918 (with Wilson's support), but after 7 years of democracy degenerated into dictatorship, and was swiftly defeated by Germany in 1939. Abandonned by Western allies, it fell into the Soviet sphere of influence in 1945, regained democracy in 1989, only to let populists ruin it all over again in 2015. A brief resurgence of reason will likely end in 2027, with more populist rule.","createDate":"1754424625","updateDate":"1754452165","approveDate":"1754424625","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144058103,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144059387","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7336030006408691}
