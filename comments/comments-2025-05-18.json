I used to enjoy them in the past but recently I haven't had any fun with them, at all. I must remember my own advice next week: skip Sunday, Andrzej!\n\nThe theme... There was an element of wit to it, I suppose, but generally I perceived it as yet another set of groaners. Can't a Sunday theme be truly smart, for once?\n\nThe puzzle was notable for featuring my wife's and mine least favorite artists. She can't stand RADIOHEAD, and my ears bleed when I hear LETO's 30 Seconds to Mars: it's one of the few bands I have blacklisted on Spotify 🤣\n\nOf course I was clueless about most of the names and abbreviations, as always. I also did not understand other terms in either the clues or answers. Some of them:\n\nVerso? RECTO? Bandeau? HAP? OLLAS?\n\nI had LEIs for luau strings, and I was so proud of it! Before I started doing NYT puzzles, all I knew of Hawaiian terms was, predictably, aloha. ALAS...\n\nThe first thing to come to my mind when I see the name OLD TOWN is of course the one in Warsaw. As a kid I loved its narrow streets and quaint houses. In a way it's only some 25-30 years older than me, however. It was completely destroyed by the Germans during WW2, as were 90% of the city's buildings on the West bank of the Wisła (Vistula). It was reconstructed in the 1950s so meticulously it was then given UNESCO World Heritage status.

Figuring out each one thereafter was a little hit of dopamine. \n\nBy the end, I was stuck in four places and kept having to switch out letters methodically in each area to get them: \n\nRECTO/BAIUL/CIAO - Didn't know RECTO and didn't remember how to spell Ms. BAIUL's name so had a Y instead of I for quite a while, and not knowing the Italian, didn't get CIAO at first. \n\nDOM/AVOCET - Didn't know the bird and still didn't understand DOM, but I'll go look it up as soon as I'm done writing this, unless someone wants to jump in and enlighten me. (Is it that kind of monk? The enlightenment kind?)\n\nROLEO/ALOU - I actually had this correct but thought maybe I was wrong when I didn't get the finished message. I remembered ALOU from a previous puzzle, but not knowing ROLEO, I thought maybe I misremembered it and tried different letters for L.\n\nAENEAS/SAWEETIE - This was purely a spelling issue.

All were outfielders and all were star players. The three brothers were the first and only trio of brothers ever to play outfield for the same team at the same time in a game, in 1963. \n\nBut for crosswords, their greatest achievement was having three vowels in a four-letter last name. \n\nIronically, ALOU wasn’t even their normally accepted surname. That was Rojas. ALOU was their mother’s last name, and in Spanish naming tradition, the mother’s surname follows the father’s surname (e.g. Felipe Rojas ALOU), with the father’s surname being the everyday surname. When they came to the US, their surnames were misunderstood, and they started going by ALOU. \n\nAnd the rest is crossword—and baseball—history.","createDate":"1747536728","updateDate":"1747638893","approveDate":"1747536729","recommendations":43,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142201476,"parentUserDisplayName":"Matthew O","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142202789","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6881893277168274}
