When I did my first pass, I had almost nothing. I thought I would not be able to finish without autocheck.

With a puzzle as hard as this I simply needed a few more crosses to get going past the 10 or 15 answers I was reasonably sure of initially.\n\nCHOPIN was a gimme, obviously. Btw, I'm not a fan of the name, for this particular airport. It is located in the Okƒôcie district of Warsaw, and it is one of the oldest airports in this country - it is not only an important transport hub but also a piece of Polish history. It was simply known as \"Okƒôcie\" for decades. Then in the 1990s for promotional reasons it was renamed. Can you imagine renaming your oldest US airport, College Park?. The managers wanted a name easier to pronounce and remember for foreigners. There was also a nationalist motive: Chopin was French-Polish. Many Polish people suffer from an inferiority complex vis-a-vis other European nations, and can't bear thinking of sharing Polish icons with others. Making Chopin patron of *Poland's* busiest airport was supposed to show there was more Polish in him than French. (In a similar vein, a politician of the 2015-2023 ruling populist party publicly claimed in 2016 that sophisticated Polish people taught the disgusting, uncouth French how to use forks in the 16th century...).","createDate":"1727416491","updateDate":"1727551981","approveDate":"1727416493","recommendations":28,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136472897","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.43899333477020264}

In fact, it is a distinct word that existed in English at least a century before until, both as a preposition meaning ‚Äúto‚Äù and as a conjunction meaning ‚Äúuntil.‚Äù It has seen continuous use in English since the 12th century and is a perfectly legitimate synonym of until.\n\n‚ÄôTil and ‚Äôtill are much newer words, having appeared in the language only in the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively. Both are variant spellings of until and till. Writers of usage guides have roundly condemned ‚Äôtill as a barbarism (apparently because it seems to have added a superfluous L to the end of until). ‚ÄôTil, for its part, has been deemed inappropriate in formal writing.\n\nIn summary, until and till can be used freely and interchangeably, but you will probably want to avoid ‚Äôtill and use ‚Äôtil advisedly.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/until\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/until</a>","createDate":"1727483432","updateDate":"1727891942","approveDate":"1727483436","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136488261,"parentUserDisplayName":"Paul","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136488670","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8559606671333313}
