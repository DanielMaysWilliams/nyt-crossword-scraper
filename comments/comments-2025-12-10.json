I think I dozed off and woke up in 1999!\n\nYou might ask what the difference is between a nature preserve and a nature reserve. As far as I know, and I may be spitballing here, just a thought, but a PRESERVE is a protected area that allows public access and even some recreational activities, whereas a RESERVE usually has stricter protections, much less public access, with the emphasis on controlling ecosystems and allowing scientific research. Both focus on conservation, but you are more likely to be able to hunt, for example, in a nature preserve (it depends on who's running the preserve) than in a nature reserve.The two terms are used fairly loosely these days, and interchangeably, but apparently \"nature reserve\" is used more frequently to describe such areas in the UK and Commonwealths (we'll have to ask the \"ZED/ZEE\" crew from yesterday's teapot tempest about Canadian nature preserves/reserves). \n\nYou'll be pleased to know that there are quite a number of protected wetland nature preserves/reserves, mainly in Asia, that include rice paddies, including the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces in China, a UNESCO world heritage site. And one or two natural reserves right in the middle of Italy's rice producing epicenter, the Po Valley. \n\nThat concludes today's discussion.

I did learn (the hard way, naturally--this is, after all, me!) that I needed to use TACT--just as noted in today's puzzle--\"sensitivity\"--because now I am living in The Best of All Possible Worlds.  (Rousseau?  Who was that?  World Lit was so very long ago....)\n\nAnyway, got the puzzle!  So very happy that RERE is not a singer or rapper or philosopher or model or judge or jurist!  \nThe only nit I see that is worth picking is the pretense that anyone, anywhere, is actually going to REPAIR any of the issues besetting this public edifice (because I'm sure that's what is being referenced here.)  Don't cut me!!  I take it back!!  Everything is fine!!  More than fine!!!\n\nOne final word:  REIN.  I loved this!  It harkens back to...was it just yesterday that we had a similar clue/entry that required a similar double think?  Will this one elicit the same level of irritation?  220 Comments!... already make me think so!  Well, I'm off to see the wizard, er, what others have to say.

It's the best bread—ever! As many did (though I already made it on the regular) I baked it every week. It was great with freshly made mango jam (we bring back from Honduras every year) and with anything. We also would cook up a package of so very not VEGGIEBACON every week to use it throughout the week in whatever. Our favorite was turkey club (bacon) sandwiches on that amazing bread. Unbelievably good! \n\nThen, my husband needed to get stents for his arterial arteries and I bought an air fryer, vetoed bacon, and apologized for trying to accidentally k*ll him with that bread. We remain mostly on a Mediterranean-ish diet now, but we occasionally reminisce about those delicious turkey club sandwiches on that amazing bread.\n\nAnyhow, I haven't purchased bacon since then, though we might have some if out for breakfast, as a treat. But last week, someone gave us two pounds of it. We couldn't say no. The only reasonable thing to do was to eat it right fast to get rid of it, right!? Har!\n\nWell, we are sticking to whole wheat bread, but it's been meal after meal of splitting a turkey club sandwich and I've just been walking around the house patting my belling and saying, \"Dam-n, that was a good sandwich.\" or \"It could have only been better with my coconut bread!\" Mmm!

So “prerecorded” helps differentiate between a rerun which was recorded and a show which might seem live but isn’t completely or at all.\n\nAs an example…since the east coast, west, central, mountain are all different time zones the first show may have been live and then replayed later for the next time zone.\n\nSaturday night live is all over this mix.   They record the dress rehearsal at 9 pm…just in case there is a crisis at 11:30 pm they can instantly cut in a section of the dress rehearsal into the live broadcast.   AND SNL also records interludes and other skits for the main show which couldn’t be done live such as cartoons.  AND they show the show 11:30 in NY and then re-air it 11:30 California time.\n\n\nSo there is a lot of different timings of the recorded media which goes into a single show.\n\nNow that everyone has time shifted their viewing so much doesn’t match its official air time and date it doesn’t matter anymore.  But at one point it did matter.\n\n\nAnd as the brother pointed out in “Back to the Future”… “ What’s a rerun?”.
