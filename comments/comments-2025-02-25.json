The crystal might be made of glass, plastic or sapphire, depending on the watch.” Even if a smart watch doesn’t have an analog dial, the display and other internals (i.e., what’s in the smart watch’s CASE) are still protected by this sort of crystal—some high-end smart watches even specifically use sapphire crystal displays. Additionally, virtually all digital computers, including smart watches, have internal clocks that are needed to keep the time for regulating the execution of instruction and other purposes. I looked it up, and these internal clocks usually use the same type of quartz crystal oscillators that are used in more traditional timepieces. (Plus, most smartwatches currently available use LCDs—liquid crystal displays—though e-ink displays aren’t unheard of.)\n\nDIAL - This one is a bit better, but as others have mentioned, many people set their smart watches to display a digital simulacrum of an analog dial, and some fancy smart watches do actually include analog dials, including physical HANDS and chronographs.\n\nAgain, none of this affected my ability to solve the puzzle, nor the overall quality of the fill, at all, but I can’t say this theme was particularly well thought out.","createDate":"1740462404","updateDate":"1740535038","approveDate":"1740462405","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140064957","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5848729610443115}

At first I thought it would defeat me: there seemed to be too many terms and proper nouns unfamiliar to me in either the clues or the answers.

Also, I may be a gamer but I've never played anything from Nintendo (I'm a PC and Playstation person, and Atari before that) so I had no idea about STAR. I did not know ONE UP, either.\n\nI thought I would need lookups or maybe even auto check to finish - which has happened on Tuesdays on occasion before. In the end though I managed to fill the grid relying on crosses and some creative guesses. My solve time was slightly long for this time in the week but not Wednesday-ish.\n\nThe theme actually helped me, for once. To protect my privacy I don't use any \"smart\" devices (and I have all personalisation and surveillance switched off on my phone), but knowing watch parts helped get me more letters for crosses.\n\nBtw, Poland has been a tea-drinking country for some 200 years (coffee only became as popular as tea in the past few decades) so I'm quite passionate about my leafy brews.

By far the oddest one I've ever seen. Can't imagine that I would have any chance at solving this one. Anyway- A Sunday from June 16, 2013 by Mel Rosen with title: \"Question box.\" \n\nAlmost impossible to describe this one but I'll a stab at it. First - there were four long across answers (two 21 letter and two 18 letter) that were clued essentially the same. The first couple of examples: \n\n23a. Start of a trivia question : IFAGIRAFFEHASFOURTEEN\n\n34a. Trivia question, part 2 : MORETHANAWALRUSAND\n\nAnd the two were clued the same way with \"Part 3\" and \"Part 4.\" Those answers:\n\n94a.  ASQUIRRELHASHALFAS\n107a. MANYASAPIGWHATARETHEY\n\nAnd then... there was a 5 by 5 box in the middle of the puzzle, completely surrounded by black squares and there were no numbers on any of the squared in that box.and NO clues for any of the answers. But there was a Notepad with the puzzle that said: \n\"When this puzzle is done, take the answers to the 10 starred clues and arrange them across and down in crossword fashion in the central 5x5 box. The resulting five-letter word spelled out diagonally by the circles will answer the question asked at 23-, 34-, 91- and 107-Across. \"\n\nRan out of comment space.

However, fancy US-style beers are often not readily available, sometimes for interesting reasons. E.g., in Germany a product may only legally be sold as beer if its ingredients are limited to water, malt, hops and yeast. Since IPAs and other US-style beers often have other ingredients, too, they may not be labeled as beer, which reduces their appeal.\n\nItaly is not known for its beer, but actually, even the biggest Italian brands offer good quality and taste. One of my wife's and mine favorite Italian pastimes is to buy an extra large bottle of Birra Moretti from a street stall, sit down on a bench and drink slowly, enjoying Italian views and doing some people watching.\n\nIn France beer is good but very expensive - by glass (if not by volume) more expensive than wine.\n\nIn Belgium beers are malty rather than hoppy, and they are generally very strong, with the quadruppel offering wine-level alcohol content, but still sold in beer-sized portions.
