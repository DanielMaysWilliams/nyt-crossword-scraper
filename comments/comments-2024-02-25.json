On the sides of those roads and at roadside rest areas there were hundreds of stalls where Polish people sold wildly painted plaster garden ornaments, mostly gnomes, bit also deer, windmills etc. It was so horribly tacky it made my eyes hurt. All those pointed hats, dead, painted eyes, grinning faces, mooning buttocks... It was the stuff of nightmares.\n\nSo why all of the gnomes, and why in Western Poland specifically? Because the Germans loved their gnomes back then, and they flocked to Poland to buy them dirt cheap.
