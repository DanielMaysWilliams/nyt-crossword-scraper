Wednesday night, I predicted a 1000-comment section, and as of right now, we're only at 914, but those comments are still open, so have at it if you want to get it into quadruple digits!\n\nAnyway, some observations from that marathon session:\n\nEven though they are known for their less-than-stellar track record with electronic solves, it should be obvious to solvers that if the NYT runs rebus puzzles regularly, there's a way to solve it online.  Complaining that there isn't when you just aren't aware of how isn't a good look.  Especially since if you'd just ask, someone would tell you how, as did happen several times.\n\nThe fact that the puzzle got you doesn't make it a bad puzzle.  Maybe you're new and weren't expecting that kind of a puzzle, but you might be more prepared next time.  Unfortunately, there's no good way to warn newcomers of rebus or other tricky puzzles in advance without ruining it for the rest of us.  \n\nAnd maybe you're not new and are just not catching on.  It's still not the fault of the puzzle.  If you don't like rebuses, there are many crossword outlets out there that don't use rebuses.  The USA Today and the Washington Post come to mind.","createDate":"1719585221","updateDate":"1719672320","approveDate":"1719585223","recommendations":11,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134224219","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9006174802780151}

In it he hypothesizes a conversation between a Phoenecian trader and his Greek customer, describing this new-fangled think called \"writing\" (The Greek had apparently forgotten all about Linear B). The Phoenecian: \"OK, this mark here stands for 'Aleph . . .no not Aleph, 'Aleph!--can't you hear the difference?\"\n*Writing Systems* is a fascinating read--at least for language geeks--and is real scholarship, but not so obtuse that an amateur linguist such as myself couldn't follow it.\n\n***   ***\n\nAh, the Diaeresis!

I have to go out for dinner soon (ironically, sushi) so I ended up giving the roll a lookup and was rolled over by the answer! Oh well! Besides, I should have come up with ALOUD and T SHIRTS sooner, those are absolutely in my wheelhouse!\n\nNice puzzle! Funny enough, for the tough spots, I kept wanting to enter a rebus to make my wrong answers work! 😆 It seemed so natural after yesterdays dozens of super fun rebuses!! \n\nI see yesterday's puzzle is up to 940 comments!! Wow! Go us!!  My work/life schedule rarely allows much comments participation on Thursdays but it did yesterday, so I did my part!! \n\nOkay, off to sushi... hope there won't be any SPEAKING ROLEs....   \n\nOh, I do amuse myself!! 😂","createDate":"1719616368","updateDate":"1719687583","approveDate":"1719616370","recommendations":15,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134243478","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-28","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5338016748428345}

In German, it's an umlaut, and it serves to alter the sound of the vowel it's above.  In French (and in words borrowed from it in English), it's a DIAERESIS, and it serves to separate vowels that normally would form a diphthong, like Noël and naïve.  Some publications like the New Yorker also use it on English words like reëlection, whereas most others just insert a hyphen.  In Spanish, the diaeresis is only used on the U, which is normally silent after a G, as in guitarra, but when it is pronounced, as in bilingüe, the diaeresis indicates that.
