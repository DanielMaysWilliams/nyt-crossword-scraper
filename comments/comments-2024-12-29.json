Comfort indeed.\n\nFurthermore, what a lovely theme, with those dashes forming LINEs one way, and acting as hyphens the other way – wordplay and word manipulation, both which I adore, all rolled into one.\n\nEven a moment of silliness, when my brain tapped me on the shoulder and told me that MUST READ is an anagram of “e-mustard”, a non-existent concept that made me smile, and, for a moment, riff on.  \n\nWow build, cozy solve, with a dash, as it were, of whimsy – this was one lovely outing for me, Harry.

Got the theme very quickly, but found it rather uninspired, and, for me, the many short hyphenated themers simply made for dull fill.\n\nI suppose any puzzle that involves hyphenated words invites nitpicking. Or is that nit-picking? Perhaps all the thematic verticals *could* be hyphenated, but \"midair\" and \"lipread\" at least are not flagged by my spellchecker. (spell-checker?) It would be especially nice if no non-thematic vertical required hyphenation, but I suspect that TP-ED does. CEELO seems to appear as CeeLo, Cee Lo and Cee-Lo, which makes it any interesting name to include in this week's puzzle.\n\nLASSO is apparently derived from the Spanish \"lazo\", the plural of which is \"lazos\". So \"LASSOS\" isn't jarring to me. WHARFS is, but perhaps the constructor is fond of British usage (like HOOP rather than \"wicket\").\n\nGuess this puzzle won't generate 1.5K comments like Art Heist of two week ago did.

Nothing makes sense until you get the trick and then the scales fall from your eyes.\n\nI was baffled and frustrated in the NW.  Every Down answer I wanted wasn't the right length -- until suddenly it was!  And all the hyphenated answers were precisely the original answers I wanted but couldn't make fit.  That's really good cluing.\n\nOnce I had the DASHED LINES in the NW, I looked for all the other long answers that would begin with the word LINE.  I filled them all in before checking what the hyphenated DOWN words would be.\n\nOf course I might have gotten the NW much more quickly if I'd paid attention to the title from the GET-GO.  I can be so dumb.  But since I don't time myself, it really didn't make any difference.\n\nI wrote in DOTTED LINE immediately.  But that's what you sign on, not what you cut along.  The phrase DASHED LINE does not come trippingly to my tongue, but there's no doubt that that's what those things you're told to \"cut along\"* look like.  Is that a term that's familiar to everyone else?\n\nA wonderful idea, wonderfully executed.  It's one of those themes I wish I'd thought of myself.  A clever, enjoyable Sunday.\n\n*Small rant: They used to make those DASHED LINES in a way that you could easily tear them off.  (Does this give away my advanced age?)

I'm sure a reasonable argument could be made, but given the revealer (DASHEDLINE) and the vertical crosses (all of which could be written as hyphenated words), using a string of hyphens seems like the best solution by far. The down clues simply don't make any sense with the letters L,I,N,E stuck in the middle but they do make sense with hyphens, while the themers also make sense with \"----\" interpreted as a dashed line, and read as \"line\".\n\nfor anyone that actually uses the en dash (–) or em dash (—) characters instead of the hyphen (-) with regularity (or even knows how to generate them on your phone or computer keyboard) there might be some confusion - but at least on the iPhone games app, those characters cannot even be generated with the keyboard that the games app gives you.\n\nMaybe it would have been better if the themers had a string of hyphens that were 3 or 5 elements long (like ---DANCE or -----DANCE).

How was I supposed to know that they wanted me to put in dashes???\"  Rather, I suspect, most solver would say, \"Oh, I didn't see that before.

Thanks to Mr. Zheng and everyone who makes these possible for us everyday. \n\nToday was also a day where I got to see how I have gotten so much more flexible in my thinking during crosswording. Nothing mind-blowing, but some areas where my initial entries were problematic and I easily took them right out. I used to be more inclined to stick to whatever I entered but now I'm better at removing things that don't serve the crosses. I had a number of those today. Once in awhile I discover I just needed to take a thing out to see a different thing and my first inclination was right, though that was definitely not the case today. It's a good lesson for puzzles and life. \n\nI enjoyed the shout outs to one of my favorite TV shows, FARGO, and two of my favorite foods, ALOO (gobi) and HASH! This good Midwestern girl certainly does love her potatoes!\n\nThere were a number of names I didn't know but they were all pretty easily getable on the crosses. My toughest was down in the lower left, where I didn't know the pitcher or the director and I had a hard time seeing YES-MEN for a while. Until I did. That was my last fill. \n\nI solved on my mobile app and had no problem entering rebus squares, once I realized I needed to. That realization came when I didn't get the happy music.

A complaint about what is accepted by the software is not the same at all to a complaint that a crossword should be only letters (didn't see any of those).\n\nBut the complainers have a point - \"----backer\" does not equal line backer, so we're already granting leeway here. Why, for the sake of ease of entry (four taps on a screen vs one) couldn't the word \"line\" stand in for a metaphorical dashed line for the downs? We've seen crazier.

There are a lot of regular (and irregular, like myself) posters here who I suspect put up some pretty speedy numbers.  I clocked in at just over 19 minutes today.\n \nSpeed is learnable, btw, and with solving streak you could probably increase your speed quite a bit. Device matters - I solve on my phone, which adversely affects my time, both in terms of fat-fingering letters as well as how many clues I can see at once.  The latter is particularly important as it limits available strategies like clue memorization, solving the downs, etc that a lot of really fast solvers use.  (I can use those tools to get some decent times but I cannot *touch* competitive solvers' times.

You then spend another 13 mins trying to find your error before trying the word LINE instead of the dashes… and then you get the music and star.  Frustrating, right?\n \nI recognize that the revealer is meant to indicate adding dashes, but I don’t think it’s a big stretch to assume the word LINE is representing dashes in this case and feel confident you have those 5 clues right.  Often the puzzle accepts variants or similar answers that demonstrate that you solved the gimmick… if you didn’t understand the gimmick, you’d have 20 down words that made no sense… so it’s frustrating to figure out the trick and get every other clue solved correctly and not get the star.  \n\nThat is why haters are hating… it’s the 15 mins spent searching for errors that weren’t there.","createDate":"1735449248","updateDate":"1735557028","approveDate":"1735449252","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138605279,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jamie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138606007","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-29","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6792157888412476}

(Which, as I remember, was called a \"crossword,\" not a \"crossword puzzle\"--but I could be wrong about that.) In those, images combined with letters to stand for words or syllables. Later, when beginning to solve NYT Sunday crossword puzzles in puzzle books, I discovered that some of them called for little drawings in the squares, such as a sun or an eye. I figured that out by looking at the answer key. When these puzzles first started appearing digitally, I was afraid that would be the death of the rebus. But I was intrigued to discover the NYT had come up with a solution: instead of entering a picture, there was a handy little rebus button where I could enter the word, which then got replaced with a picture upon successful completion of the puzzle. \n\nNow, any time that button is used, we tend to call it a rebus, even if only letters are entered.\n\nToday, because the dashes represent \"dashed lines\", to my mind they are a rebus in the old sense even though in the desktop version the rebus button was not required.","createDate":"1735493871","updateDate":"1735550160","approveDate":"1735493876","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138608654,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ellen","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138612507","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8718460202217102}
