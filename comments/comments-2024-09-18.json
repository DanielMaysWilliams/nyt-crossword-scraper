I can promise you that neither of our puzzles tomorrow will have tiny little circles.  Will knows of my complete lack of interest in how tiny little circles can be manipulated within a grid by constructors -- and he is always kind enough to humor me when we collaborate.\n\nOf course Will can construct ANY type of puzzle with any type of collaborator.

It certainly was a challenge but also fun and enlightening when I finally got there. I’m old, so I’ve watched the old (and delightful) film, “Desk Set” (starring the great duo Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) many times. The other big star of that film is a very large early computer which they called EMERAC, (or “Emmy”). When I saw the clue, I thought of Emmy right away, but I also knew the name ENIAC from something—maybe another film?—and that was what I put in that space. I had a lot more luck with the bottom half of the puzzle than I did with the top. As Sam points out, the crossing fill was crucial for this one. I never would have gotten the church without crosses.
