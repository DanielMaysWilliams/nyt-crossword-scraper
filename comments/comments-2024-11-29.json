FELLing is the treatmet of a fabric's surface (blending, softening, etc.--by brushing, generally) and FELTING (usually achieved by boiling the woven fabric) shrinks the fabric, making the weave tighter and even somewhat waterproof.  There is a segment of quilters who do wool applique--usually with FELTed woolen fabric.  The brilliant colors and texture are quite wonderful.

For a Friday, there seemed to be relatively few obscure (for me) items (AYI, LUMIERE, KINPIRA, KCUP) but all were finally gettable from the CROSSES.\n\n In a themeless puzzle it’s always fun to find correspondences among the entries: here SANTA FE and SAINTLY echoed at a distance across the grid’s diagonal axis, while the light of LUMIERE matched the heat of CALORIE. Among the several French entries there was also one cleverly fractured word: (5D) TOMB - (16A EAU (de Napoléon). \n\nThis was, I think, my first exposure to KCUPs.  It occurred to me that if we replaced the initial W of 38A WAXFIGURE with an M, it would make an ideal cross with 32D.","createDate":"1732912943","updateDate":"1732938140","approveDate":"1732912946","recommendations":12,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137952448","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-29","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7398936748504639}
