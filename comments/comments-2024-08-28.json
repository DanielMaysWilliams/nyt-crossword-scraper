Well. My brain found this theme to be divine.  It was given a new kind of puzzle to crack, had to think on its feet, and came alive.  \n\nNormally, in crosswords, you have the clue, and from it you deduce the answer.  But today, in the theme, the clue led to ANOTHER clue, which led to the answer.  Two riddles for the price of one!  When the first theme answer came, it came with a huge aha at how it all worked so perfectly, and amazement at how Jesse came up with it.\n\nBut that‚Äôs just one angle.  If you had crosses in the answer, you could guess what it was and try to plug it in the blanks of the original clue, and if it worked, well, for me, it also brought a huge aha, not to mention another jaw-dropping ‚ÄúHow did he think of this?‚Äù.\n\nAll I know is that after I got my first theme answer, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get to the others.  My brain was crackling with life, astonishment, and happiness throughout.\n\nSome commenters and a certain blogger complained mightily about SHOVERS.  Hah! This was a highlight for me.  That word embedded in ‚ÄúThey push over stuff‚Äù ‚Äì double hah!  Triple hah!\n\nThis was one of my favorite puzzles of the year.  This was a treat.

There are twelve (12!!!) theme clues -- which is absolutely amazing theme density -- and I thought all of them were smooth as silk.  I define \"smooth\" as an answer completely in sync with the clue, so that the puzzle is completely fair to the solver.  And Jesse has a limited amount of space to play with in his theme clue writing.  I spent some time wondering if I could have pulled this off?  My conclusion:\n\nMostly worsely\nAnd much less tersely.\n\nI think most solvers will find that this plays quite a bit easier than it looks. The blank spaces seemed a bit formidable when I first perused the theme clues, but once I saw what was happening,  I parsed everything without any hiccups.

So much that here I am, still dwelling on it on Thursday mid-morning... \n\nI really wanted to comment yesterday morning the second I completed it, but had a busy day. When I returned to the column last night, I got sucked into reading all the euphoria that surrounded others' experiences of this puzzle! Having now read all 360 previous comments (I never do that!!), I still feel the need to chime in. \n\nSo much to love in this puzzle! I'm a bit surprised at all the confusion over PEE: I have learned the hard way (and thanks to the Wordplay columnists) to read question-mark clues as self-referential, and this one fell into that category easily for me. Also, CHOLER following down-grid from ROMEO put extra shine on that answer. Loved the empath Deana TROI relating to KLINGON language, too... \n\nI flew through it, completing almost two full minutes faster than my average -- and I don't solve for time, and paused to relish the themers! \n\nSpeaking of themers, I'm in agreement that 39A felt a wee bit forced... But now for two days I've had this 90's classic in my head. Coincidentally, it was just on the radio earlier this week; it's like having a mosh pit in my brain.
