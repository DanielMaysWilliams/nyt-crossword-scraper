The solve may have been quick but it provided no enjoyment for me. Bummer.\n\nThe only semi-interesting thing about Poland the grid inspired me to say has to do with ROTC. We have nothing of the sort over here, possibly for historical reasons. \"Studium wojskowe\" (\"Military course\") was an obligatory month spent by male students on army training under \"communism.\" (Men who did not go to university spent a year or two in the army). Most people in the studium wojskowe, like my dad, ended up with the infantry, and some with artillery, like my father in law. Of course they learned very little. My dad mostly remembers the rock-hard, salted herring they were served at the cantina. The concept of studium wojskowe, like almost everything else tied to the old, pre-1989 regime, was phased out under democracy, and it's unlikely to ever return by association to \"communism.\"","createDate":"1754285188","updateDate":"1754374789","approveDate":"1754285190","recommendations":41,"replyCount":13,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144010340","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5231641530990601}

The truth is that this is a cop-out clue to force something that isn't a word to become a word, and I'd prefer some more transparency there, or at least a cuter clue. For example \"ANAG\" could've been something like \"someone who is always getting on your case\" as in \"quit being such a nag.\" Is it the strongest clue?

He was an astonishing ball player--power hitter, and less known for his rocket arm from right field.\n\nHe only played for the Yankees a few years, once of which he topped Babe Ruth's season home run total of 60, although Maris played 162 games in that season, but Ruth only 154.  He failed to hit 61 home runs in his first 154 games.\n\nHe was widely hated in New York, because he was not press savvy like Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, and others of the Yankees from that era.  The press thought he was surly, and to an extent he was.  But it was mostly misunderstanding.\n\nHis story is brilliantly told in the HBO movie 61*.  \n\nHe died very young, 51, from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Thankfully, Yankee fans accepted him as time went on.\n\nAnd yet, he's *not*, I repeat NOT, in the Baseball Hall of Fame.  He had a single season home run record that stood for 37 years.  Before the steroid era.  This is, in my opinion, the second most embarrassing omission in Major League baseball, right after ignoring the Negro leagues for decades, even though the Negro Leagues were every bit as good as the Major Leagues.\n\nI saw him once at an old-timers exhibition game at an All-Star Game in the early 80s.
