I could not make a connection between a LIGHT SLEEPER and literally light bed paraphernalia, especially having read a lot about weighted blankets and how they supposedly help people sleep better.\n\nBtw, I woke up again at an ungodly hour (3 AM this time, 1 hour before the puzzle is released in my CET time zone). LIGHT SLEEPER indeed... Hopefully I will manage to get a few more hours of shut-eye once I put the phone away.\n\nThe only stumper for me in the grid was Jack SPRAT. As you can imagine, I know no English language nursery rhymes (actually, I'm only familiar with two Polish ones), so the clue meant nothing to me. When the answer revealed itself via crosses I was surprised. Why? Well, I do know the name Jack SPRAT, but only as a restaurant in Treasure Beach, Jamaica, where my wife and I feasted on crab in 2011. There was also a record shop there. We still have their t-shirts. I needed to Google the clue to understand what was going on after the grid was done.\n\nThis made me wonder about nursery rhymes in general. Maybe they are much less of a thing in Poland than in the US? I googled Polish examples of commonly known \"rymowanki dziecinne\" (literally: children's little rhymes), and only got the two I remembered from my own childhood, and another one I haven't heard about before (probably because it's from the Kraków region).

I think in Polish culture the line between a nursery rhyme and a poem is blurred. If it's old and of unknown authorship, it's more likely to be called a rymowanka ([nursery] rhyme). If it's more recent and penned by a known author, it will generally be called a wiersz (poem; if you see a hint of the word \"verse\" in \"wiersz\", you're right: the etymology is the same, from the Latin versus). Thus, \"Wlazł kotek na płotek\", which originated as a folk song 300 years ago, is a rymowanka, and \"Lokomotywa\" by the famous Julian Tuwim is a wiersz, even though kids are its only intended audience.","createDate":"1748928206","updateDate":"1748984711","approveDate":"1748928208","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142551248,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142552293","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8678408861160278}

Featherbottom managed to transform the mundane reality of an empty room into a canvas for existential inquiry. It was a performance so daring, so utterly devoid of conventional theatrical artifice, that it transcended mere entertainment and ascended to the realm of pure philosophical statement. One left the \"theatre\" (if one can even call it that, in its glorious emptiness) with a renewed appreciation for the profound significance of what is not there.

It was a thing at school, both primary and high school, and also my parents and grandmother took me to Warsaw's best theaters from time to time, probably trying to provide me with the sort of education and experience one expects of the son of university and research institution professors (what we call \"inteligencja\" over here; I think one translates that as inteligentsia).

Artificial? yes, that's it, artificial! - the spectacles felt. The set was just that, a set, an obvious decoration, the epitome of fakeness.  And the acting was, well, theatrical, the emotions exaggerated or understated, the lines painfully unrealistic, more like the actors were reciting poetry or philosophy rather than trying to draw me into an actual story about anything that felt real enough for me to care about.\n\nThen I went to a production of Richard III, where the set was a few rough-hewn boards thrown together, and actors all wore leather jackets and pants.
