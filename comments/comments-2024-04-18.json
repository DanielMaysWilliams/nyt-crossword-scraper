They typically indicate that the clue and its answer are part of the theme.\n\nIn Mr. Kwong’s puzzle, the stars mean something else, and solvers must read the revealer at 63A in a different way in order to figure it out.\n\nCan you solve this puzzle without doing so? Probably. Should you? In my opinion, no, because then you’ll miss out on all the fun.\"\n\nBy starting this way, you encouraged me to return to the puzzle without reading more. \n\nI'd made several passes and was getting a word here and there, but no foothold. As soon as I went back after your intro, the asterisks started clicking as missing letters. And then the revealer movie revealed itself, and how fun to have used your intro as the needed foothold. I then returned to enjoy the rest of the column, and some of the comments.\n\nSolvers upset at the use of 'star' for 'asterisk' might take a longer look at those two words themselves. \n\nThanks for the foothold and encouragement!

Seven of his 23 Times offerings fall on that day.  And what trickery today!
