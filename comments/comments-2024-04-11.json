So I decided to solve while also watching some recorded stuff in the background.\n\nBig mistake. By the end, I decided to just put the TV on pause until I finished.\n\nI started by putting PREP in 1A. A slam dunk, right? But then 1D had to be FALCO, and 1A turned into FOOD because ANNO was a gimme, LICE made sense, and COURT kinda halfway made sense.\n\nThat's when I realized it was the return of the tricky Thursday that's been missing the past few weeks. I knew something was afoot with FOOD and COURT, but not quite what.\n\nThe big issue here was that the other two entries on each line weren't clued with hyphens this time. They had real clues, so it was less apparent that unorthodox tricks were at hand.\n\nWell, eventually, I got the trick and filled in the first two.\n\nBut then, because I was splitting my attention, I completely forgot what was happening when I got to the bottom two. That made the SW corner a debacle for me.\n\nUntil I paused the TV, and said, \"Wait a minute!  I know what's wrong!\" Up till then, I couldn't figure out for the life of me why PRIMER was \"Valuable property\". Finally finished at nearly double my average, but it wasn't the puzzle's fault.\n\nMultitasking is way overrated.\n\n* Sitting in traffic so epic the NYT had a major article on it yesterday.","createDate":"1712834240","updateDate":"1724828718","approveDate":"1712834243","recommendations":24,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132467548","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6917686462402344}

The theme answer in the top row, for example, has three words, their letter counts being 4-3-6, which means the theme answer in the bottom row must have a count of 6-3-4 to meet the requirements of symmetry.  But not only that, only certain letters could go into the black squares of those rows.\n\nTough, tough, tough to find answers that would work, and work smoothly!\n\nMost importantly, how was the solve? Sweet! For me, there was a terrific “Hah!” when the theme became clear, and the SW fought me hard there for a while – much to my brain’s delight.

Some TIL's, even if unknown, were crossed fairly & let things flow— but w/a wonderful crunch!

I very occasionally (maybe once every two or three years) get a chance to play Trivial Pursuit in a specific large group setting, but that's about it.\n\nBut as Spacebabe said, I didn't need personal experience playing Clue to solve the puzzle.  Just a vague idea of how the game is played was enough.\n\nBeing good at crosswords means that you absorb a tiny bit of things you're not that interested in, and in that way, you become both more culturally literate and more proficient in crosswords.\n\nJust being generally observant in the world, and also not ever saying \"I'm glad I didn't know that answer\", as someone else said in another comment, helps a lot.  The crossword is not for the incurious.\n\nHope the next one suits you better!","createDate":"1712833082","updateDate":"1712877803","approveDate":"1712833084","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132466112,"parentUserDisplayName":"Kimiko","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132467392","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5046315789222717}
