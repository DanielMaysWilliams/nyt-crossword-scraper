I feel bad for the employees as I must have been a frightful sight, and not something they should have to deal with. They were wonderful though.\n\nSo I'm sitting at a table with a glass of ice water they brought me, trying to collect myself. Then-kapow-I spent a minute or three on fire, sweating profusely. Huh. So my fever broke and I hadn't even realized I was sick.\n\nI felt a bit better after that and walked home. I don't know if it was the flu or something else, but the symptoms weren't too bad so don't cry for me Argentina or any other country.\n\nMy nose wasn't stuffy or runny. Minor sore throat. Slight headache. I almost feel guilty because the worst symptom was also a saving grace: I was utterly exhausted. So rather than lying in bed suffering, I slept. The whole day. Woke up a few times feeling too hot or too cold, but quickly fell back asleep.\n\nAnd now I'm almost completely recovered, wondering, as many of you here are wondering about Saturday puzzles, is the flu getting easier or am I just getting better at it?","createDate":"1705168049","updateDate":"1705189304","approveDate":"1705168051","recommendations":4,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130435456","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.652701735496521}
