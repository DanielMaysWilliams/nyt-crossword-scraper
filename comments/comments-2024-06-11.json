I'm having a hard time keeping up with the dates, and the puzzles used to be a good way for me to do it. Yesterday was a real Monday, for me, but today was not very Tuesdayish. I guess what I object to is not the puzzle; once I understood it, I was okay with filling in the missing clues. It was just that it didn't feel like the usual smooth solve I've come to expect on a Tuesday. I have to admit it...it felt like work.\n\nBut not every puzzle will be on my crudité board, and someone will always love a puzzle that I don't. So, I'll be glad that I finished it, even though it took longer than usual. Today isn't a volunteering day, so what was my rush?
