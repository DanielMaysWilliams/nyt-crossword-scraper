Although Brian Eno coined the phrase \"Ambient Music,\" one could argue that the real father was the French composer Erik Satie, who, in 1917, came up with the idea of what he termed \"musique d'ameublement\" (\"furniture music\"). Of course, the concept--music to to played while something else is happening, and not really listened to--goes a lot further back than that: Georg Philipp Telemann's 1733 collections of Tafelmusik come to mind (\"Table music\"--i.e. music that is to be played as background dinner music). \n\n***   ***\n\nAnyway, Eno insisted that the best Ambient music should be \"interesting, yet ingnorable.\" And I would be remiss not to include a youtube link of a piece every Wordplayer should acquaint themselves with: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsDcAcANGE\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsDcAcANGE</a>\n\nThis former O.hi.o-an had no problems with the [tractor] metaphor, but there are a lot more tractors in I.o.wa than in Ohio--perhaps John Deere should consider a (two-wheeled) redesign.","createDate":"1720092983","updateDate":"1720190154","approveDate":"1720092985","recommendations":18,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134406392","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8955949544906616}

I figured out the theme early on after SENSEI, since I already had the revealer. Knowing the theme actually did help me because I had no idea where Gonzaga was but knowing that it had to be a can sound led me right to Spokane. It was also helpful in confirming MILEAU and ODYSSEY. \n\nWent through it faster than normal for a Thursday, which is kind of funny because when I first saw the grid layout before I started puzzling, I thought it was kind of unusual so I was prepared for super tricky or difficult. I always like to spend a few seconds looking at the grid before I start. I'm not sure why, I'm not looking for anything in particular but some grids are just pretty to look at!\n\nPersonally, I prefer to compliment my eggs with, \"They're EGGs-cellent!\"\n\nYou couldn't pay me to eat another Red Delicious apple, but bring on the Honeycrisp! Fun fact, I proudly work at the college that developed the Honeycrisp! In fact, I was recently at a wedding in which the person who is behind the Honeycrisp was also in attendance. I was pointing him out to my husband like he's a rockstar, which he is, little apple nerds that we are!\n\nOkay, now I know it hurts to say goodbye, but it's time for me to flyyyyy, Time for me to fly!","createDate":"1720114269","updateDate":"1720196052","approveDate":"1720114272","recommendations":16,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134414488","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8126683235168457}
