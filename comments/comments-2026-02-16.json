I fully understood what she meant and why she said it once I got there.\n\nAs for the MIT Mystery HUNT, when I went to MathCamp (which is exactly what it sounds like), they had a similar puzzle weekend based on the MIT version. A lot of the counselors were MIT grad/doc students. Our team won. We stayed all night, solving the final puzzle around 4 AM. The prize was getting to design the hunt next year.

There are some very famous ones such as Ypres and La Somme, but as Canadians we of course went to Vimy Ridge, taking a train from Lille to Arras. That day is still with me. The first part of the tour is given by Canadian college students in park ranger uniforms. They show you the trenches and tunnels, and recount how the battle played out, emphasizing the Canadian know-how, discipline and grit. It's incredible to hear this story standing where it all happened. But the most moving part of the visit is when you walk up to the towering stone memorial on the ridge, which remembers some 60,000 Canadian soldiers killed during the Great War.

I don’t really know from Jazz. But I had first entered “scat”, which I believe is vocal improvisation in jazz. But with the crosses later came around to VAMP (i knew the term was used in jazz, but not the exact meaning). Looking it up later however, I could find no definition that claimed that “vamping” meant improvising - though I guess one could improvise a vamp and then iterate it (which I suppose might satisfy the “it’s a valid clue” crowd). However, based on your (and other comments) and my inability to find an any definition that claimed “vamping” could mean improvising. I would call this at best a bad clue (especially for a Monday)- unless someone can point me at some common usage examples.","createDate":"1771271151","updateDate":"1771285084","approveDate":"1771271154","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148923666,"parentUserDisplayName":"Wayno","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148931123","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8333420157432556}

My immigrant father, who arrived in NoAm with not a word of English (five other languages... but not English) bought himself a shelf-ful of Churchill to teach himself English from the best. He also got Shakespeare, Bartlett's Famous Quotations, and plenty of poetry. So I learned early on to love and respect English-- not just as a tool of persuasion or, worse, deceit, but for its beauty.\nSo, sometimes I feel compelled to call out misuse and 'cheap shots'.
