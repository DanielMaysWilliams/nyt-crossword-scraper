Anne Boleyn was beheaded (she is one of Henry's ...axes) as was Catherine Howard, but there is compelling speculation that Catherine of Aragon, whose marriage to Henry was annulled but who died very young (36) by no apparent cause, was poisoned. \n\nIn any case, if Henry VIII bellied up to the bar, got out his royal wallet, turned to any of the women in his vicinity, proclaiming aloud in the sudden subdued silence, \"Drinks on me,\" this would cause quite a bit of UNEASE in the crowd.

Everything had gone smoothly through the main course, and they were sitting with coffee.  I came around with a carafe to top up their cups, and was behind one of the guests when my to stubbed against a crease in the carpet and a dollop of steaming joe spilled out and landed on his shoulder.  Nobody saw this happen.\n\nNow this scalding liquid had some distance to go before reaching this guest‚Äôs shoulder.  It had to soak through the jacket, shirt, and perhaps an undershirt as well.  This was that longest moment, that agonizing wait, two seconds probably, that felt like an eternity.  I was frozen, speechless, helpless, not knowing what to do.\n\nOh, the burn came, I saw a moment of confusion on his face, then he rubbed his shoulder with his hand, quickly stood and looked at me, jaw dropped, as I profusely apologized.\n\nIt all ended well (I paid for having his suit cleaned), but what I will never forget is that moment of waiting, waiting, waiting for the coffee to travel through the layers.\n\nThese are the moments that add texture to a life.  Now I laugh about it.

It was a gorgeous Wisconsin summer (yes, they exist), and we were sitting outside at the garden tables. I was wearing white jeans. Oops. The waitress brought our drinks, and mine was a red sangria. The table was of the iron variety, with an openwork makeup. \n\nI could see the problem before it happened; the bartender had filled the drink to the rim, in a martini-style glass. As she put it down, her hand shook oh-so-slightly. My white jeans were now red. All five of us...four at the table and the waitress...let out an audible \"oh no!\"\n\nI spent the rest of that meal trying to eat my delicious lunch while the waitress, manager, and bartender each brought me a solution (Try this club soda, here's some baking soda, get them dry cleaned and send us the bill...) as I in turn tried to reassure them (it's okay, don't worry about it, I don't blame you, it happens). I did get them cleaned (and did not turn in the bill), the stain remained. They were Chicos, and I loved them, but they weren't new, and today, they would no longer fit me. It's just fabric, and it really wasn't her fault. \n\nBut when I saw the theme, I thought of this episode as well. It was a fun puzzle, nonetheless.
