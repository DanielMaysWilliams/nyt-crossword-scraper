The more things change...\n\nBut one thing that did change was that the \"new format\" for comments actually went live sometime today.  When it was first offered as an option, I tried it for a day or two, and went back to the old one, hoping they'd eventually give up on the new format.  It just doesn't work well here, where people reply to an original post, then someone replies to the reply, and then several other people reply to subsequent replies.\n\nThis makes for a hierarchy of progressively more indented replies.  And then, you have to notice that there are replies to replies that actively have to be opened.\n\nReading elsewhere in the paper, I see that this phenomenon is unique to the crossword comments (and maybe some of the other games comments).  Most news articles' comment sections do not have long threads of replies and replies to replies.  \n\nIn other words, it might work really well for the rest of the paper, but it's horrid here.\n\nI guess we just get used to checking for threads that are totally hidden.  But I've found myself paying more attention to opening hidden replies than actually paying attention to what people are saying.\n\nSad.  Easy puzzle, difficult comment section.","createDate":"1770779761","updateDate":"1770849415","approveDate":"1770779763","recommendations":21,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148805191","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5605596899986267}

Andre does what lawyers do best... argue cases, which he appears to do quite well. If there is no case, counsellors will devise one; it's what they do. I mentioned that to him a few days back, but it got lost in last week’s Great Erasure scandal.\nI've referred to a few of his highly critical comments, but gave him the credit (blame?) for it. I realize my comments can come across boorish and snarky, albeit some by design, but they pale in comparison to his poignancy and unmatched candor. Although there are other commenters here with equal zeal, his are relentless.\nAs Agent J says in MIB, \"You know what the difference is between you and me? I make this look GOOD!\" (That would be he, not I saying that)\nIn conclusion, unless you're either a) trying to call him out (yeah, that’ll work), or b) enticing him to write a legal brief on the topic as your lesson in litigation, consider how a deep thinker's mind is wired. And, should you ever get an \"Ooh, respect\" reply, you've just been granted a temporary stay of execution.\nGood luck with both. ;)\n\n\n\nIf this survives the cut, there are simply no standards here.","createDate":"1770832162","updateDate":"1770881423","approveDate":"1770832163","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148819090","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5557749271392822}

Andre does what lawyers do best... argue cases, which he appears to do quite well. If there is no case, lawyers will make one. I mentioned that to him a few days back, but it got lost in the Great Erasure scandal.\nI've referred to a few of his highly critical comments, but gave him the credit (blame?) for it. My comments can come across boorish and snarky, albeit by design, but they pale in comparison to his poignancy and unmatched candor.\nAs Agent J says in MIB, \"You know what the difference is between you and me? I make this look GOOD!\" (That would be he, not I saying that)\nUnless you're either a) trying to call him out, or b) get him to write a legal brief on the topic as a lesson litigation, consider how a deep thinker's mind is wired.
