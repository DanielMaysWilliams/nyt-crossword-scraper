This is basic stuff for web/app designers. In today’s puzzle, the circled letters are essential to completing the grid and I can’t see them. \n\nIn dark mode, the circled squares are virtually invisible. Personally, I use dark mode because I do the puzzle when it comes out at night and I like to minimize my light exposure, but there are people who use dark mode to compensate for a visual impairment. It is a valuable accessibility feature. \n\nThis is easy to fix. Make the circles yellow in dark mode so that they are visible. If you would like to replicate what I see, solve today’s puzzle on an iPhone 15 pro max with the screen brightness almost all the way down and the puzzle set to dark mode. There are other visual accessibility issues with your app, like how difficult it is to see the numbers, but this is a really easy one to fix, so it’s a great place to start. \n\nThank you,\nTorey Adler - avid solver, currently on an 893 day streak.","createDate":"1742383678","updateDate":"1742431295","approveDate":"1742383679","recommendations":10,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140704342","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5136053562164307}

You and Jeffrey make a great team and I can’t wait to see more of your puzzles in future. This was so much fun to figure out, such an unusual and clever theme. I hope you can ignore the curmudgeonly comments from a few people who perhaps are having a bad day. This will go down as one of my absolute favorites of the year. \nI had a bad night’s sleep and was a little grumpy when I started doing my puzzles this morning, but this gem put a smile on my face. 😊","createDate":"1742402942","updateDate":"1742434221","approveDate":"1742402943","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140717458","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9859113693237305}

I speak perfect Polish and very good English Soni have expertise to evaluate this.
