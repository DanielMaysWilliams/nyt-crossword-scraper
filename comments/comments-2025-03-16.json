Les Mis is the correct spelling, now and forever ;) It drives me nuts that this foolhardy affectation of using a Z is dug so securely into culture.  It makes no sense visually or vocally or even for economy.  It's just cutesy for cutesy's sake.  So very d_mb.  (And I know the nickname took early in the show's run; an affectation with legs.)\n\nAnyhow, the flyspeck that actually held me up was amine instead of amino.

Those of you who don't bother looking at the Sunday titles are doing yourselves a great disservice.\n\nThe hint in the title, plus the non-clues for the two-way words, should be enough to figure out what to do.  (Of course, you have to know that when several clues are just a hyphen, that means the theme involves continuing an answer from somewhere adjacent.  One isolated hyphen clue could just mean that the answer is MINUS or something similar.)\n\nAnd whenever you see a pattern of answers being one letter too long, or something similar, you know where your theme answers will be.  That clinched GOODOH for me, and even though I wasn't really familiar with that expression, it's in all the dictionaries.  \n\nNewcomers have no concept of how obscure answers once were.  That didn't make them better puzzles, just more obscure, so I'm glad they aren't around much anymore.  But names like LORCA and NEUER aren't really obscure.\n\n\nSeveral solvers complained about Naticks.  I didn't know ADENOIDAL, but because I saw \"swollen glands\" in the clue, I was able to figure it out.  \n\nFor what it's worth, xwstats.com rated this puzzle HARD, with the median solver 7% slower than average.  That comports well with my experience, which was about 2/3 the time given for the median, but about 10% slower than my Sunday average.","createDate":"1742094498","updateDate":"1742199457","approveDate":"1742094500","recommendations":12,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140618524","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6118548512458801}

Much like words like “irregardless” and “affect” vs. “effect”, and phrases like “could care less” and “extract revenge”, I hear or see this commonly misused mostly by English native speakers here in the US though seldomly by those “whose first language is not English.”  So, I do find it a bit of a condescension on your part by your calling out that particular group.

You of course get the same loss of nasal resonance if the velopharyngeal valve is blocked by large adenoids.\nVarious well-known people in the UK are commonly described as having \"adenoidal voices\"---presenter Melvyn Bragg, politician Ed Miliband, comedian Frank Skinner, all spring to mind.
