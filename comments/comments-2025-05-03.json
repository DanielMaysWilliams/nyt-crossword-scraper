I did not finish it cleanly. I had to reveal two squares in the upper left (I prefer to do that over lookups because the reveals deny me the gold star). \n\nAlso had to change SnIT to SKIT when I still didn't get the happy music. Not knowing the food name (though I have had it), that was the only thing I could see that might be wrong, though I only think of SkITs as comedic. \n\nThe reveals were the A and I in ADLAI. I just couldn't see any of those crossings. I tried ADLER, foolishly missing that ADLER was filled in by crosses in the lower right. Oh, also had to fix GLiON at 35A. Some real tough crosses for me.\n\nIt's all good though. I had fun despite a current bout of vertigo, which slowed me down but didn't cause my problems.

I learned about the ZOOMIES, big time! \n\nPoor pup already had anxiety issues and must have thought he'd been abandoned again. I'm glad we could help but it freed me from wanting a dog.

Barbecuing on balconies is illegal, and on the lawns between apartment buildings it is frowned upon. However, every Polish city and town has a communal barbecuing area, sometimes officially designated by the municipal authorities and the fire department.\n\nUnder \"communism,\" the authorities wanted people to do everything together rather than individually - this also applied to recreation, rest and relaxation. Communal recreational areas were created, with sport, cultural and leisure facilities, often in forests, on lakeshores or riverbanks. It was one of the pretty cool features of that regime.\n\nThese places survive, like the Park Kultury (Culture Park) in Powsin, on the edge of the Kabacki Forest, just south of where I live. I used to go there as a kid with my parents, and it is one of my favorite destinations for long walks even at present.\n\nWell, anyway, democracy and market economy brought with them barbecuing culture (unknown in Poland pre-1989: back then we baked sausages over bonfires and baked potatoes in their smoldering ashes; nobody owned a grill, and we did not know hamburgers). Those \"communist\" recreational areas have become top barbecuing spots, with hundreds of people grilling away on weekends, and the Long Weekend, too. \n\nUkrainians have had a similar communal culture for decades, so they gladly come to places like Powsin, too. Ukrainian of refugees and expats is almost as common as Polish there now.","createDate":"1746251731","updateDate":"1746344492","approveDate":"1746251733","recommendations":28,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141877619,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141877681","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.750885009765625}

Consider the possibility that it's a temporary bug, you experience it when no one in NY is working, or it's platform specific. Possibly user specific. I don't mean to sound critical, because that's not what I'm thinking, but many times you have a software issue that I do not have. It's not easy to keep up with all the different platforms. First there are apps, which are OS and hardware dependent, then there are browsers, which are also quite variable.\n\nI don't know what platform you are solving on. If it's an app, Apple runs a tight (and expensive) ship. Their apps tend to have fewer problems. Android, on the other hand, is a wilder experience. Not only do programmers need to keep up with multiple OS versions, they need to be hardware specific. \n\nIf you're solving in a browser, which browser? I have three or four loaded on each of my devices. Chrome is a little too \"evil empire\" for me, but it also has the fewest site problems. Try dealing with the notorious French bureaucracy on Firefox. Yeah, no chance. Very buggy.

Remember that before that, the local Arabs refused a partition of what is now Israel and the occupied territories that would have given them more land than they have now.  \n\nRemember that Arabs who are citizens of Israel constitute about 20% of the population, and are afforded the same rights as Israeli Jews.\n\nThe more you look back, the more cut and dried the story is.\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/mu8djtn6\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/mu8djtn6</a>","createDate":"1746308340","updateDate":"1746328796","approveDate":"1746308342","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141886988,"parentUserDisplayName":"N","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141887983","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-03","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6373844146728516}

I specifically said I didn't want to argue.  I really wished you'd left it at that, and not tried to convince me that only one side is deserving of any consideration.\n\nHowever, I will say this:  I am a little shocked at your unwillingness to consider the horror that *everyone* is facing in this horrible situation.  Palestinian kids, whether they've been called that forever or not, are *still* kids, who hurt and bleed and die.  Likewise they mourn their dead parents, just like Israeli children.  And the parents on each side both feel the loss of a child.  \n\nA flip historical summary that blames the \"other\" group or doing or not doing something completely ignores the humanity of both sides.\n\nAnd if any story in the history of humanity has had two sides, this is one of them.\n\nI really don't trust *anyone* who thinks this is a clear cut problem with an obvious good guy and an obvious bad guy.\n\nI wish you had just left it alone, like I asked, because I can't unread your post.  Nor can I not defend a group of people who, while imperfect, and still suffering horribly.\n\nI'm sorry that any sympathy or consideration for their problems bothers you so much.","createDate":"1746311415","updateDate":"1746329089","approveDate":"1746311415","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141887983,"parentUserDisplayName":"N","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141888586","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-03","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8199750781059265}
