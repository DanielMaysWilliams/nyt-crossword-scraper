But cray cray is pretty close. And the rebus haters will remain silent, we p(RAY). \n\nSpeaking of quick finishes, I recently watched WORDPLAY for the first time. I think it's from 2005, and centers around Will Shortz, some of the top competitive solvers and a few constructors. Probably most of you have seen it, and I wouldn't be surprised if a few of you participated in the tournaments. Top tier players can complete a Monday puzzle in well under 3 minutes and the Sat-Sun puzzles in 6-8 minutes. Sheesh!\n\nThe tournaments, you could tell, were lots of fun, lot of love and warmth and good humor, close friendships, nerd utopia. Maybe they still are. The emphasis is on speed for the competitive solvers, although Shortz and the constructors emphasize the beauty of xwords, their playfulness and restorative effects, and some of the celebrity solvers -- Bill Clinton, Mike Mussina, Indigo Girls, John Stewart -- also extol the play, art, charm, poetry, healthfulness, and bonhommie of doing xwords. Is there a way of balancing the two? Keeping a fine clip but appreciating the minutiae and finery? I haven't found it, and am a habitual last guest to leave, so I think these tourneys are not for me.

Throwing a mechanic into the puzzle that breaks the rules without telling people does not \"add to the fun\" if you don't even know that these mechanics exist, so you never know to even try them. It's 2024. We've got decades of research on how to design good games thanks to the video game and board game booms. There's no reason for crosswords to still be stuck in the 70s and smugly setting up artificial barriers for newcomers. Rule 1 is to make sure players have access to the rules in one way or another.

When you can't even break 100 on a good day?  \n\nSolving quickly is a sign of experience combined with awareness of the outside world.  Intelligence figures into it somewhat--see my reply to Alice a little earlier--but largely is not a major factor.  Experience is the factor that helps you realize you're looking at a rebus within the first corner of the puzzle.\n\nIs the typist who can do 75 words per minute particularly smart?  Is the world's fastest runner necessarily the world's smartest person?\n\nWhen you have solved for decades, you will probably solve in 12 minutes or even less.

I often find myself taken aback by the reproachful replies here to those professing their dislike of rebus puzzles. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and preferences, but some commenters seem to take it personally. Weird! The oft replied \"skip Thursday and Sunday puzzles\" seems reasonable to me, but I find it unfair that some are telling you to \"just not do them\" today, as we have no way of knowing it's a rebus puzzle before attempting to solve, and, of course, it's Wednesday.\n\nWhile I don't think they should stop publishing rebus puzzles altogether, enough people seem to agree with you that I think NYT should consider adding a setting that could be turned on/off which would then display a notice (perhaps on the info page) when the puzzle contains rebuses. That would also be a good place to include a link/instructions on how to enter a rebus as not everyone is familiar with them, and there is some confusion every time they pop up.","createDate":"1732127140","updateDate":"1732135289","approveDate":"1732127143","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137747148,"parentUserDisplayName":"Alan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137758143","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-20","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6297332048416138}
