It was a gimme because I've seen it so many times in clues here! For once an American abbreviation did not give me any trouble 🤪\n\nFor somebody who speaks German, sticking an S at the end of DELICATESSEN looks so wrong! I know this is English so it's ok but wow... My brain.exe will always freeze for a moment upon seeing that. The Polish word for delicatessen is \"delikatesy\", which just like in German is plural already. Originally in Polish the word did not even have a singular form, and was used to describe not only a kind of shop but also any fine and luxurious food, very different from what people usually ate. If you were invited to somebody's home for a fancy supper, you might comment about the food being \"delikatesy\". These days that usage is dated. However, \"delikates\" (the singular of delikatesy) has emerged as slang for a delicate person, eg. somebody who faints at the sight of blood or can't stomach hot foods. I'm a \"delikates\" when it comes to sadism in movies, for example.\n\nIn general this was quite a pleasant puzzle. I had to look up some stuff, but much, much less than on many a Saturday. Perhaps 5 lookups was what it took? One of them was for the baseball stat, of course.\n\nThe baseball long answer I had to get from crosses but the others were easy to figure out.
