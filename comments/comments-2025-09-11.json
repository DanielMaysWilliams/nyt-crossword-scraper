I had no idea what a Graycoat might be or why it would solve to REB. That was unfortunate as the cross of the first letter of REB was the answer to a clue I did not understand, either - I don't know what a blowout is. That in turn crossed with another unknown, of EULER. My best guesses around there were jEB (I thought Graycoat might be a guy's name), jOlT, and ElLER. When I did not get my gold star upon completion of the grid, I realised my mistakes had to have been there. In the end I only resolved that with lookups, learning what a Graycoat was in the process. \n\nElsewhere I was confused by TEE SHOT. No wonder - I still know nothing about golf, and have zero motivation to change that. I didn't understand Lush/SOT either - I got the answer from crosses but had to look up what it and the clue meant. Drunkard... OK. \n\nCAIT looks like a random letter salad to me.\n\nI never watched Seinfeld but I learned ELAINE from Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nIn a non-touristy region of Jamaica my wife and I trekked through the jungle with a local guide (just the two of us and Francis the guide) to visit a cave where bats lived.

I wrote that comment before I did the puzzle because I assumed the Thursday puzzle would take me a good long time. Instead it was my second fastest Thursday ever. \n\nTo sum up about Stacey Abrams, she was even better than I could have possibly imagined and I was already a big fan. If you ever have the opportunity, give her a listen! The show that I watched with her in it was in Minnesota Public Radio program called Talking Volumes. If you can catch it online, I highly recommend it. Incredible!! 😍😍\n\nTo sum up about the puzzle, well, I really like rebus puzzles... This one was a little more apparent than usual. I also really love EmDASHES, Even though it wasn't the right answer, they're just so elegant!! \n\nIt was nice puzzle overall, but not quite what I've come to expect on a Thursday. \n\nI also seem to have a thing about APEs being used disparagingly in puzzles... I've mentioned before that I hate when they clue APE as an imitate or mimic... Well I find myself really disliking today's WENTAPE too...

I got it from crosses myself and never gave it another thought. \n\nApparently in theory the matter of dashes is as complicated in Polish as it is in English. I just checked professional Polish websites, and I learned to my surprise that they recognize three types of dashes:\n\n1. The longest one is called myślnik (literally, one related to thinking) or pauza (pause), and it - your em dash - is used in the middle of a sentence, eg. I did not cry — in fact, I laughed!\n\n2. The półpauza (half-pause), your en dash, is slightly shorter than the myślnik, and it's used to denote number ranges, eg. 2023–2025 has so far been my period of activity on the NYT crossword comment board.\n\n3. Finally, dywiz (a word meaning roughly the divider), also known as łącznik (the one who joins), is your hyphen, and it is used to connect words, like in a double-barrel surname, eg. Kowalska-Nowak.\n\nNow, in practice, no normal Polish person makes any sort of distinction between the three types of dashes. Almost everybody uses dywiz in all contexts and to perform the functions of all of the dashes - probably simply because it's easiest to enter on a standard keyboard.\n\nI was not taught about different dashes at school, despite having great teachers. That must have been because in the 80s and 90s we only studied cursive writing, not typing. Actually, despite 2 decades of publishing papers, I only learned about there being 3 rather than just 2 dashes today.","createDate":"1757586136","updateDate":"1757649899","approveDate":"1757586137","recommendations":38,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144925037","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6476820111274719}

That time we just flew into Montego Bay, rented a car, and drove around the island for two weeks. We skirted all the resort towns, trying to find much more special places. We spent several days at Blue Harbor, Noel Coward's old property. There we stayed at the same cabin his celebrity friends had decades earlier - Sophia Loren had swum in the infinity pool at our doorstep. However, staying at a slightly dilapidated, colonial mansion in the middle of the jungle, owned by two American researchers studying the local wildlife, was definitely the highlight of our Jamaican trip. The hosts had a Harlequin Great Dane called Quarterdogs, because it cost a quarter of a million of Jamaican dollars to have her imported into the country. She was the only purebred dog we encountered in Jamaica, and seeing her run around the ruins of colonial British barracks in front of the mansion was quite surreal, like something out of an indie movie. A guy from the village (where Usain Bolt was born) came in to cook for us and the hosts in the evening, and we enjoyed suppers on the verandah, talking with our new American-Jamaican friends into the night. It was awesome.\n\nI like Curb Your Enthusiasm because Larry David's character reminds me of myself 🤣 (at my rare worst, anyway).

Everyone knows Nancy. \n\nTrixie was so much more delightfully real to me.  \n\nHere's what Gemini says: \nWhile both were popular mystery series for young readers, the Nancy Drew books were significantly more popular and had a far greater cultural impact than the Trixie Belden books.\n\nHere is a breakdown of their popularity:\n\nSales and Longevity\nNancy Drew has been a publishing phenomenon since her debut in 1930. The original series, consisting of 56 books, has sold over 80 million copies and continues to be published today in various forms. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, television shows, and films, cementing its place as an enduring franchise.\n\nIn contrast, the Trixie Belden series, which began in 1948, had a shorter run. The original series ended with 39 books, with sales that were a fraction of Nancy Drew's. While the books maintain a dedicated fan base, they never achieved the same level of mainstream success or market saturation.\n\nCultural Recognition\nNancy Drew is a global icon of juvenile fiction, with her name becoming synonymous with a young female detective. She is widely recognized, and her influence has been noted in the works of many contemporary authors. Trixie Belden, while beloved by her readers, did not reach the same level of cultural recognition.","createDate":"1757618488","updateDate":"1757653012","approveDate":"1757618488","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144939330,"parentUserDisplayName":"HeathieJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144939656","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5021719336509705}

In modern systems that support Unicode, a distinct \"true minus\" sign (U+2212 ) is available for mathematical contexts, designed to match the height and thickness of a plus sign, while the hyphen-minus is shorter and sits lower.\n\nSo:\n\nEM dash - widest (as wide as a “m” letter)\nEN dash - in-between width (as wide as a “n” letter)\nHyphen-minus - shorter than EN dash\nTrue minus - most of the time same width as hyphen minus - but sits higher from baseline than hyphen-minus - at the same height as the horizontal part of the plus sign.\n\nOn the plain QWERTY keyboard - most of us use minus and hyphen with the same key.","createDate":"1757615481","updateDate":"1757654429","approveDate":"1757615481","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144926080,"parentUserDisplayName":"Cristian","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144938608","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7215760350227356}

I actually tried to introduce it into Polish, but it always got edited out of any of my scholarly papers.
