When I got to the train station I was told that all trains for the day were delayed indefinitely, and that my best shot was to hire a taxi for the hour-plus journey. Well, the man at the ticket window couldn’t have known about my aversion to taxis, of my life-long HATRED of that dreaded mode of transport, that my childhood pet aardvark had been run over by a speeding taxi cab in front of my home, so when I launched into a screaming tirade, stomping my feet, pounding my fists, and verbally eviscerating this pour soul behind the glass until he began weeping openly, it might be said that I behaved somewhat unfairly in that moment.  Nevertheless I cabbed it to Toledo and arrived outside the Church of Santo Tome some seventy minutes later.  I was there to see the great masterpiece “The Burial of Count Orgaz” but inside the church I was told by a kindly old docent that the tower in which it was displayed was temporarily closed for cleaning, and that it would be some thirty minutes until the wing would re-open.  Well, that docent couldn’t have known of my hatred for thirty minute intervals, that my college mascot was killed by a thirty minute interval, so when I flew into a shrieking rage and dumped a bucket of gazpacho over her head, it could be said that I wasn’t being particularly charitable in that moment.","createDate":"1771909222","updateDate":"1771946553","approveDate":"1771909223","recommendations":3,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149106509","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7876419425010681}
