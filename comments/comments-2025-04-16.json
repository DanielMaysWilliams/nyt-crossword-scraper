Each time I heard amazing jazz—live.

It may have been different before 1989, when Western music had very little presence here, and the government did not promote what it considered Western and decadent, like pop or rock.

It needs a bit of a cultural change, though, since there is a degree of stigma associated with asking to take the remains of a carefully prepared meal home in a bag to reheat---you're seen as undervaluing the work of perfectly timed preparation and plating, somewhat.\n\nIn pizza and tapas places in the UK, thougb, where more food is served than many people want to eat, a doggie bag is often offered if there's food left. My SIL routinely orders enough pizza for two meals, and talks half of it home, for instance.\n\nPersonally, I just never go back to places that serve massive portions---my appetite deserts me as soon as a heaped plate lands in front of me.

Ja Rule (a few days ago), where did that come from? \n\nBut I also keep up with pop culture (don't have kids so it's not as easy for me as for my siblings).

(Looking at you, Chappell Roan.)\n\nMy weakest area is sports, and that's not age-related. \n\nI also think that the more you solve, no matter what your age is, the better you get. I watched the Wordplay documentary a few weeks ago and was very impressed by the 20-year-old guy who won the American crossword tournament. Wow.\n\nAs for this current puzzle, I didn't grow up eating any of those cereals, but I saw all the commercials for them and have been to a grocery store. I finished the puzzle without lookups, but there were quite a few answers I had to guess and figure out using logic. That's what you learn the more you solve.","createDate":"1744846750","updateDate":"1744866088","approveDate":"1744846750","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141482233,"parentUserDisplayName":"Niki B","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141488270","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8973705172538757}
