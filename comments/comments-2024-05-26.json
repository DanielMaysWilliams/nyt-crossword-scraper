Humor warms the soul.  When a puzzle combines the two, well, it makes me feel good all over.  And that’s just what John Kugelman does time and again.\n\nThis is, after all, the man who previously brought us [“I know they’ve had them on all day, but let the kids eat their candy.  After all, a Ring Pop is a … “] for WEARABLE THING TO TASTE.  Who clued JUNK DRAWER as [Erotic artist?].\n\nAnd today the wit combined with the twinkle in the eye continues.  Everyday phrases reimagined by taking a word meaning “insult”, and using one of its other definitions to marvelous effect.  \n\nWhat makes the theme answers sparkle is not only the wordplay, but their clues – funny, right on the mark.  Clues made by an artist, IMO.\n\nPlus, this is one of those themes where the cat is out of the bag after the first theme answer, leaving six more to try to guess with as few letters filled in as possible – something my brain relishes.\n\nIn addition, some excellent cluing originality, new clues for answers clued many times before: [Get off to a flying start?] for TAXI, and [It’s bright when its full] for MOON.\n\nTaken all together, your puzzle produced a spontaneous mental standing-O, John.  I laughed.  I wowed.  My brain’s work ethic was satisfied.

I believe the last time it was clued otherwise was on 2/15/2009, when the clue was, “Fox News anchor Pemmaraju”. Prior to that you have to go back to 3/21/1993 when the clue was, “Fringefoot”, a type of lizard (also clued like that 10 times previously throughout the 70’s and as far back as 1967). Between 1942 and 1953 it was clued 5 times as today to the Hindu goddess. The first time the actress was the clue was 5/2/1990, “Actress Thurman of ‘Dangerous Liasons’”. a movie made in 1988 when she was just 18 years old. Of note, she appeared on the covers of British “Vogue” when even younger in 1985 and 1986. It anyone wonders about the connection between the actress’s name and today’s clue I suspect it has to do with her father Robert, who was a former Tibetan Buddhist monk and my professor of Eastern Religions at Amherst when I was a Freshman there in the 70’s. (Her mother was Timothy Leary’s ex-wife). I long time ago I linked this article from the NYT about their family, but if anyone missed it last time, it’s worth a quick peek…\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/4f2aejbe\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/4f2aejbe</a>","createDate":"1716733327","updateDate":"1716744230","approveDate":"1716733330","recommendations":11,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133469874","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.715746283531189}
