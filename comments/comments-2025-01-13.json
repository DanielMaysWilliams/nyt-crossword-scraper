I remember being taught that, like modern French or Spanish, English used to have two forms of \"you\", one more formal and one more familiar. I was taught that, somewhat counterintuitively, thee/thou had been the more familiar; God the Father was family and loved us, so we addressed him familiarly.\n\nDown the rabbit holes I found precisely that info, but also its direct opposite--that we address God more formally using thee/thou to show respect.

I offer as an alternative that when we see something that reminds us of bad current events, we might stop and stop and take a moment to contemplate the current event and wish for an improved outcome. Removing anything that reminds us of something bad could make the world bland. It’s not like the clues said anything specifically about Southern California burning or loss of life or property destruction. No one writes crosswords intending to hurt people’s feelings. They are just words, and sometimes words remind us of other stuff. That’s not always a bad thing, it gives us the opportunity to stop and think about something that hurts.

Instead of the closed loop of the original runic character, scribes began to open the loop, making the thorn look very like a lopsided y. This was so confusing that there are examples of scribes placing a dot over the real letter y to distinguish it from þ. That sort of thing couldn't last so there was a drift towards using the Roman digraph th instead of þ. The open-topped þ then persisted in only a few conventional short words and abbreviations, among them þe (the), þs (this) and  þt (that), looking like ye, ys and yt.
