Part of the problem was that I had CAse before CAMP (you can make a case or break a case, right?), and so I thought this themer might be requiring the coxswain to tase the rowers. Ah, no.\n\nOther than those hiccups, this was a smooth solve. I love the fresher cluing of ECO (we've had our fill of greens lately) and ORCA (hey, that's a killer clue about brain size). \n\nSam, regarding your column title, subtitle, column photo and caption, it seems to me that Chloe and Alissa are \"best buds\" when it comes to SHARING the duties for creating this crossword, as exemplified by the two flowers in the photo.

Hoping the former, but it always feels like the latter especially when muttering profanities after 20 plus minutes of head scratching.  It’s a weird thing with these puzzles, there can be such a fine line between fun/clever/tricky and downright annoying.
