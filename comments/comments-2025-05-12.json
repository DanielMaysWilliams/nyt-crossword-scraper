I didn't understand the theme even when all its elements emerged from the puzzle, and even having read the column once. Then I reread it and it dawned one me. OK. The themed entries are AND-Y as a mouth is tooth-y. The slightly depressed curmudgeon in me does not love the theme, but he is not annoyed by it, either. I'll call that a win 🤣\n\nI filled the grid in standard Monday time, but as I was solving it seemed hard in places, to me, for a Monday, with quite a few unknows, including some of the themed entries. I don't drink cocktails so I'm hopeless with their names - back when I was an alcohol abuser I just drank straight whisky by the glass, and these days I stick to beer (most often non-alcoholic), wine, and an occasional cognac or brandy. \n\nCANDYLAND came up in these puzzles once before in the two years I've been doing them, but I only remembered it when I had almost the whole name from crosses. It's not popular over here, or it wasn't when I was a child.\n\nI also realized I have no idea what a MALT is. The word comes up in these puzzles quite often, and I think a malt shop featured on Gilmore Girls (yes, a middle aged curmudgeon may enjoy a light hearted, human interest show), so I thought I'd look the product up. There is no Polish version of the \"malt\" entry on Wikipedia, but one of the examples given is the Polish \"podpiwek\" - a drink I know well, and enjoy from time to time. Obviously though malts are less popular here than in the US.","createDate":"1747026315","updateDate":"1747108443","approveDate":"1747026316","recommendations":23,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142054783","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5001387000083923}

When a typical Polish person, especially from my youth, drank vodka, it was about getting drunk, quickly, as a goal in itself. Shot after shot after shot, bottle after bottle. Sad at best, disgusting at worst. I'm ashamed to admit I engaged in heavy vodka drinking once or twice, in the company of fellow legal scholars on conferences, and the memories are anything but nice.\n\nAlso, for me, the spirit itself does matter. Vodka is bland and tasteless, and it looks like plain water in your glass - it's about the alcohol content alone. Now take dark rum, with its warm hues and rich flavour, and an aroma evoking burnt sugar. There is no comparison between the two, really.\n\nOne of the reasons I dislike traditional, Polish weddings is how there will always be hundreds of bottles of vodka. Bad music, bad food, cringey speeches, the worst alcohol of all, and sweaty men in cheap suits drunk on it, everywhere.

This approach could be intended to streamline the viewing experience, reducing clutter in threads with many nested responses. However, I understand this makes the VAR function appear inconsistent, especially since it used to show after 3 replies, and now it’s not triggering reliably.\n \nYour workaround of clicking the timestamp to display all replies, and the fact that emailed links show all replies, aligns with this explanation, the timestamp likely forces a full thread reload, including nested replies, while the email link bypasses the streamlined view. I’ve tested the thread you shared, and I can confirm the VAR button isn’t consistently appearing, which suggests a potential change in how we display replies.\n \nI'll note this ticket as feedback for our team to review and consider as we continue to look for future improvements for our solvers, thank you.\nLovedeep D.\nCustomer Support Specialist\nThe New York Times\"\n\nMore in the next reply.","createDate":"1747064074","updateDate":"1747112548","approveDate":"1747064075","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142061407,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142067360","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-12","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.651390552520752}
