Always \"rigmarole\" (minus an A). So that held me up for a while. And the convoluted Merriam-Webster etymology is also new to me.\n\nIn Scotland, the Ragman Rolls of 1296 are notorious---instruments signed by the Scottish nobility, under duress, pledging allegiance to Edward I of England and his puppet, John Balliol.\nThe 2000 signatures made it a complicated document to prepare and sign, and as an act of betrayal of principles, it had negative connotations. Hence, the story goes, the origin of \"rigmarole\".\n\nThe \"ragman\" aspect has various suggested origins:\nThat there was once someone named Ragman who had prepared a similar document. Meh.\nThat the \"rags\" are the multiple ribbons attached to the seals of the various nobles (the \"men\").\nBut I think I'm on board with Nigel Tranter's suggestion (IIRC) that \"ragman\" was a dismissive reference to the humbled Scottish nobles themselves. Seems obvious, but I don't know if that sort of usage is otherwise attested from the time.","createDate":"1748095798","updateDate":"1748125654","approveDate":"1748095799","recommendations":12,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142366092","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5526455044746399}

When I looked at the second word I saw that RIGAMAROLE would fit, and later when I started working Down I was able to use that as a basis for four more guesses. 34A, 39A, and 57A were other possible guesses, but as bedtime approached, I decided to peek at the column.

Elsewhere, Luke uses the word \"pandocheion\" to refer specifically to an \"inn\" (which would be more accurately described as a caravanserai) in the parable of the Good Samaritan. And the KJV elsewhere translates \"katalyma\" as being some sort of guest room.\n\nSo one alternative reading of the story is that Mary and Joseph had planned to stay with friends or relatives, but the upper guest room was too crowded to accommodate them, so they were housed downstairs, with the family and their livestock---it being common to keep the animals indoors for safety (and central heating!) Hence, then, the ready availability of a manger for a crib.\n\nSo no heartless innkeeper!
