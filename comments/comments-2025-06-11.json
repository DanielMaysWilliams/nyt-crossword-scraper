When I was a child in the 1960s, I got a birthday present of a US map as an inlaid puzzle. Each piece was an individual state (except for the very small adjacent ones fused together), so I got the tactile as well as the visual input as to the shape of each one. I loved playing with it, seeing the state nickname and flower on each piece, figuring out where it went and wondering about what to me were exotic western states like Wyoming and Nevada, places I couldn't imagine ever going to. \n\nSimple as it was, it was one of the best learning tools I can remember. To this day I can fill in all 50 states on a blank map. Highly recommended for kids or even adults. I hated geography in school and now I find it fascinating. (Travel helped too.)

An odd plural, to say the least. Of course, it's there to supply LA and MS. Both of which have small issues of their own.\n\nYes, most of LA is west of the river, but the terminus of the river passes through the interior of the state. All the other states are (essentially) on one side of the river or the other, as indicated by their positions in the grid. And MS is MISSISSIPPI, which already appears, albeit as a river, in the grid. \n\nAnd poor KY is wholly neglected, as is MN. \n\nAs a lover of geography and maps, I should have enjoyed this theme. But I just didn't. (Maybe I would have if I were not a lover of geography and maps?) Getting the various states in correct positions both E to W and N to S using just four themers (with MISSISSIPPI down the center) is certainly quite an accomplishment. But perhaps that feat is more exciting for constructors than for solvers.\n\n\"Does some creative accounting?\" for SPINSATALE was cute, and SUPERMOONS is a nice long vertical. The rest of the fill didn't impress me.\n\nAn easy solve---faster than yesterday's---but not a really a satisfying one.","createDate":"1749647971","updateDate":"1749709195","approveDate":"1749647971","recommendations":2,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142768137","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.49854180216789246}

No matching links that I've seen, but @Justin posted lyrics to Big River.

Thanks for your addition! (I told my husband about all of the references and now we're listening to their first album.)\n\nI myself (redundantly) have had this in my head as I read through the comments.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/TvMS_ykiLiQ?si=tAmQFMwX9vCeyncH\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/TvMS_ykiLiQ?si=tAmQFMwX9vCeyncH</a>","createDate":"1749685374","updateDate":"1749687447","approveDate":"1749685375","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142786987,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eric Hougland","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142788508","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9259280562400818}
