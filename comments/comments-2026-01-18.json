I have PROBLEM at the end of one theme answer and ARMOR at the end of the other.  Will this be clever and fun?\n\nBut there's no way around it.  I cannot find out without dealing with trivia nonsense like home planets in Star Wars and Instagram posts and a rock band and discontinued IPods and I just don't wanna.\n\nI did the Cryptic instead.  Instead of tiny little squibs of useless information, every answer was its own exercise in deduction and puzzle-solving acumen.  I found this one very easy for a Cryptic at the top and crunchy at the bottom.  Had to cheat on 3 clues to finish.  Looked up synonyms for one word in each clue for 16D and 20A.  Used Anagram Solver to get 5D.\n\nUnlike cheating on a regular puzzle, cheating on a Cryptic requires skill.  You have to know WHAT to look up.  Old hands at Cryptics may be able to guess what I looked up for those three clues.  Non-Cryptic solvers won't have the slightest idea.\n\nThis one's easier than many Cryptics and it plays very fair, which many Cryptics don't.

No one needs to prove their right to speak.\nBut we all learn that not every truth needs to be spoken. (\"Do these pants make me look fat?\") Some things can and perhaps should remain unsaid.\nSo which principle dominates at which moment? And who decides? \nLast question first. The backstop on who decides is, I very much regret to say, the emus. This, like a mall, is a seemingly public but technically private space.  The NYT owns it, even though we pay for its use via our subscriptions. They can shut it down.\nBut itchy trigger fingers lose customers. So does ill-tempered fractious wrangling among the locals. Fortunately for the NYT,  they're pushing an addictive substance. So they can give us a long leash.\nDo we have the right or power to censor each other? Legally, probably not. But equally, we should use our speech considerately. No blanket condemnations, no evictions, no flouncing off in a huff. Just some reasoned expression of why what you said has affected me this way and, in reply, the same to explain why we didn't expect your response or, if we did, why we felt something more serious overrode the courteous regard for our shared space.\nGood gray tedious compromise between reasoning people, boring though it may be, and a healthy dose of regret and recalibration all around.","createDate":"1768784541","updateDate":"1768795477","approveDate":"1768784543","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148174021,"parentUserDisplayName":"Esmerelda","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148174526","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5745864510536194}
