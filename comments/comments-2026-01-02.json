I was intrigued.\n\nAt the end of the first class, the instructor said off-handedly that we'd be doing a show at the end of the class.\n\nI did not know what to say! I can't do a show! Get on stage without a script?!?! No way! \n\nAll my classmates seemed pretty psyched about it, but I informed them, sheepishly, that I would almost certainly not be able to perform in a show on stage.\n\nWell, now I've done 100s of shows, and, while I don't enjoy watching improv, I do enjoy performing. If the audience doesn't like what I do, that's on them. I perform for me. My partner and I also do scenes at home all the time. It's fun ... and there is always truth, which is cathartic.\n\nImprov gave me the confidence to approach life more freely. It also gave me the ability to fail publicly without wanting to literally die. (Okay, I'm still working on that, but I'm a lot better.) I quit drinking. I got out of a long-term relationship that I'd figured I was destined to die in.\n\nAnyway, that's part of my story...","createDate":"1767356954","updateDate":"1767421645","approveDate":"1767356955","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147702217,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147702519","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6239690780639648}
