My situation: On Tuesday, I went to bed after completing the Wednesday puzzle.  I possessed my usual self-satisfaction, smugly content my 500+ puzzle streak was intact.  To my alarm, on Wednesday, I realized I had forgotten to do the Tuesday puzzle, and after I did it, I observed an ugly blue square in my archive of golden boxes.

No longer will they have to feign being impressed or even interested when I work my streak into a conversation about their cat.  Likewise, I’ll feel better not having to deal with eye rolls and sarcasm every time I tell them how hard the Saturday puzzle was.  I’ll also get sweet release—no longer will I carry that streak ball-and-chain; instead, I can focus on politics, current events, and other non-distressful things.  \n\nOn the other hand, Tuesdays are gimmes, and I did one puzzle each day.  Why should I lose my streak if they were switched?  Also, facts don’t matter—having been alive the last 10 years, I now know they don't exist, and I can live in my own reality.

CRISSCROSS was easily gettable but APPLESAUCE confused me. I entered it, very hesitantly, once crosses indicated what it would be, but I don't get it. Is the only reason for the latter phrase being there that it rhymes with the former? Anyway, in Polish sitting with ones legs folded is \"siedzieć po turecku,\" literally \"sitting Turkish\" (unlike English speakers, we don't use capital letters in adjectives derived from proper names).\n\nI had to guess FEDEX based just on the final X, and it was similar with SHAW and RILKE: I knew the names but not the quote or title, so I had to rely on crosses and trust myself to enter the missing letters.\n\nFor a minute I wondered if there might be a Friday rebus, because the only rapper Banks I am familiar with is Azealia.\n\nI did an alphabet run for the crossing of SAPI(D) and (D)ART.\n\n\"Asfalt\" is the only Polish word to describe an oil-based road surface, and since I am not familiar with American ice cream types, the entry of ASPHALT was very easy for me. I don't think I've ever seen it here before though, and I've done well over 1000 NYT crossword puzzles.","createDate":"1765514996","updateDate":"1765605550","approveDate":"1765514997","recommendations":18,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147253028","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5907868146896362}

Don't lie. \nIn ethics, the generally held position oscillates between /never/ lying and only lying in extreme circs -- e.g., to hide an innocent from a would-be murderer presently able to carry out that intention if the innocent's location is disclosed. (Remember, some say you can't lie even then. Regrettably, Victim is going to be offed but your moral stance remains intact!)\nCalling it \"pretending\" doesn't make it not-lying, unless you're five.

Even if no one else ever knows, /you know/.\nNow, if your query isn't about ethics, do whatever you want until you get tired or slip up, or your family stops listening. Just don't imagine you're doing something right or even tolerable. You're treating your family as  less worthy than you.

On the other hand, the Native population has always been here, and western movies were much more popular.\n\nHowever, sitting that way mimics how you sit for yoga, and how Indian gurus are commonly pictured as sitting.

I was raised on the real thing: The Grimm Brothers, H.C. Andersen, and scores of mythological tales. Let’s just say that, for better or worse, I wasn’t a Barbie girl. \n\nI was at a party a couple of years ago, and the couple’s daughter came in for a bit. We made small talk. She was reading Andersen, was reportedly enthralled by him. “Oh yeah?” I said. “So was I at your age,” and I got on the floor with her to see the book. “What was your favorite story?” the mom asked (I think I was being not-so-covertly quizzed on my kid-friendly credentials). “Oh, the one about the paper ballerina and the tin soldier,” I said without hesitation. The mom—and the grandmother, who’d come in with the little girl—were confused. “I don’t recall there being one,” the mother said. “How does it go?” So I recounted it—without any problem after 40 years, I might add—right down to the ballerina burning up and the soldier melting down. The two women still wore blank looks. It turns out, our American version of H.S. Andersen’s tales couldn’t Disneyfy that one, spin it all rosy and uplifting, so it’s excluded from what the kiddoes get to read. \n\nHere I’d spin off into a long monograph on the ancient psychological and sociological reasons non-rosy and non-uplifting lore had been fed to kids by cultures through history, but I’m out of characters and need to work anyway.","createDate":"1765535814","updateDate":"1765585612","approveDate":"1765535816","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147254171,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ιασων","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147254320","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6938907504081726}
