The only* drawback (which was emphatically not Hoang-Kim’s fault) was that I was able to figure out the theme from the title and Will’s note (with the hint “fitting, given the theme!”) even before filling in the first entry. As a print solver in the magazine, I saw the ten hyphen clues right away and guessed what was going on. While I didn’t think immediately think of a (TEN)T DRESS, I saw the trick at ALUM(NINE)WSLETTER and from there was able to drop the numbers into their spots.\n\nWhile that made for a bit of a speedier solve, and dispensed with the usual buildup to an “aha!” moment, none of that detracts from a terrifically impressive construction. Thanks Hoang-Kim for the fun puzzle. \n\n*PS — I understand the concern about 45A and was grateful to learn something new (although I think it could have been introduced into the comments with a bit more grace.)

The virtuosity of the count-down numbers -- in order, all going down, is extraordinary. Little things caught my eye: aspirer resting easily atop \"Don't work too hard\"...the threesome of freight train / red cap / steel ...the Italian sub theme of Corleones  (and their various alliances and avengers) / meatballs / Nero & Sixtus / Michelangelo's pieta ...the rhymes of owlet & snippet, phono & exacto...\n\nYet overall I had mixed feelings about the countdown theme, wanting it to end with a cool graphic takeoff effect (bound not to work on various apps and platforms, since the tech emus in the Games Dept. don't always BETA TEST, yo!) or some fill at the end to blast us off. Instead, we get the opposite, \"Concern at the end of a space journey.\" I so wanted something to happen after I did the count down, which is all about the anticipation of release. Relief denied is justice delayed! Or something.\n\n\"Red caps\" have an interesting history. They were first worn by Black porters, starting in 1890, to distinguish them from the blue caps (mainly white) who had other duties. The red cap then became symbol of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters as they organized under the guidance of the great A. Phillip Randolph, which was largely Black until well after desegregation. As I rarely take trains I'd be interested to learn if there are still red caps and if a racial element is still associated with the term.","createDate":"1709434449","updateDate":"1709564513","approveDate":"1709434451","recommendations":25,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131574843","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7644925713539124}
