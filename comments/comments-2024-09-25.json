The senator, school and AIDS researcher I had to get from the crosses. Some trivia I looked up, especially in the trivia-heavy W half of the puzzle.\n\nEven though I know the \"do re mi fa sol la ti do\" thing - those names are the only thing I remember from the incredibly useless music lessons in 1980s Polish primary school - I did not understand the theme. I needed the column to get what was going on, and I didn't find it particularly interesting for personal reasons. I can't play any music any more. Not that I ever could do it well, anyway. I *sort of* played the flute in school - we all did, as it was the only instrument we were taught how to play (probably because it was the only one simple and cheap enough to be mass produced for millions of \"communist\" children), and very, very badly, too - but I forgot how to quickly. Also, I never really could read music - I only knew what I had to do with that stupid flute to get the corresponding sounds, but that's it - I could not hum or whistle the notes. So yeah, even once I understood it, the theme left me cold, with memories of time wasted in those ridiculous music \"classes\" with an alcoholic misanthrope for a \"teacher\".","createDate":"1727241410","updateDate":"1727308517","approveDate":"1727241412","recommendations":19,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136425446","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7479294538497925}

From the deepest layer of cerebral cortex, the Sunday puzzle's rainbow rebus brought back vivid memories of my first year out of college; living in my own apartment, too poor to afford a bottle of wine I came to appreciate after taking a wine appreciation class instead turned my interest into savoring good coffee. My Sunday morning routine was to take a quick walk to the nearby newsstand to buy the Sunday paper, brew a good cup of coffee and begin solving the Sunday crossword. Back then, I would struggle and it would take me an entire week to crack the puzzle if I was lucky. I've just begun solving crossword around that time and I remember this particular puzzle very well - it was one of the first rebuses I've encountered. Once I realized I could squeeze in letters into one square, I colored them in instead. \nThe color filled squares, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the clanging of hot water radiator of the apartment... as I started filling the squares tonight, this time on screen, they all came back along with answers like Violets Are Blue (123A), Geegaws (51A), but clues for Carnac (22A) and Cat (91D) needed a little refresher.

By TV I mean the only two channels there were. Channel 1 ran a daily cartoon at 7.00 pm, before daily \"news\" at 7.30 pm (\"news\" rather than news as it was almost all propaganda and lies). I really liked those Polish and Czech shows at 7.00. But Western cartoons were the real treat, and very elusive. In the mid 80s my parents spent a fortune on a VHS machine (you had to pay in dollars for one; the price was extortionate at the then exchange rates) and on the black market they got me bootleg tapes with Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. No Casper though, I don't think. I *did* see him somewhere though, just a few episodes, but I can't for the life of me remember where and under what circumstances.\n\nBtw, you asked about Europe. Do keep in mind the Poland of my childhood in the 80s was behind the Iron Curtain so my life experience from back then does not in any way reflect a European average.","createDate":"1727274491","updateDate":"1727304448","approveDate":"1727274495","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136430770,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136431932","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6321162581443787}

No muss, no fuss, no bother.  Nothing to \"puzzle out\".  But what if all those RINGTONES had gone, unclued, in black squares ringing the puzzle?  Or, alternatively, if they were to be written outside the perimeter of the puzzle?  Plenty for the solver to have to figure out!\n\nAnd instead of an easy Wednesday, you'd have a really, really hard Thursday.  Or even a worthy-of-the-day Saturday.\n\nThus does my mind work, Peter.
