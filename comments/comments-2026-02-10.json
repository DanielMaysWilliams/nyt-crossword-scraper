The book highlighted in the puzzle, Coming Into The Country, is a complex portrait of many aspects of life in Alaska. I’ve read it at least four times.  Other books about the New Jersey Pine Barrens, life on a Hebridean island, Princeton basketball player, Bill Bradley, tectonic geology, oranges, and birch bark canoes, to name a few, are all great reads.","createDate":"1770693896","updateDate":"1770775614","approveDate":"1770693897","recommendations":46,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148771595","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-10","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9706295728683472}

For 17A, I briefly had POwER PLAYER, until I realized that 3D MAwE... didn't look right. I had the EI of 21A and still didn't realize it was EILISH, but a few more crosses made that obvious.  I sailed through to the bottom.  I didn't know MCPHEE, but the crosses filled it in.  I managed, despite doing the lower third almost completely via Across answers, not to notice ST. LEO there, but if I hadn't gotten it entirely via the crosses, the words \"Catholic\" and \"lion\" in the clue make it a gimme, even if I'd never heard of the place. \n\nOverall, another easy puzzle; completed it 10.8% faster than my Tuesday average.\n\nSome nitlets, though:\n\nAgain, the formal name is PANERA Bread.  Yes, I know, even their own commercials call it just PANERA, but it still is an (Informal) usage.  And isn't it more of a fast casual restaurant than a bakery chain?  (Yes, I know you can buy a bag of baked goods to go.)\n\nAlso, NEE means \"born,\" not just [Formerly named].  You can't say \"Jacqueline Onassis, NEE Kennedy,\" only \"NEE Bouvier.\"  (Yes, Simpsons fans, that's where Marge's maiden name comes from.)\n\nNeither of these things make their clues wrong, just a little askew.
