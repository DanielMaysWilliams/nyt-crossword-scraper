But in this puzzle's landscape, it's best to be a little paranoid and stick to the recipe. The NSA is about, and if not them, then NASA, or maybe the FBI (represented here by \"Edgar\" as in J. Edgar Hoover), too. \"I see you\" is more a threat and a warning than a statement from them. Or they may simply raid you.  And at that point you better A) have plenty of ammo or better yet, B) Boo-gee. As in, \"I see you...later!\" Sooner or later you'll be forced to fess up. And don't start with that \"I thought I was growing fiddlehead ferns\" line. They've heard the soli from that opera.  Those lyes will only make them loch you up quicker, and in one of the uglier prewar hulking jails, not some modern facility where you could do SAT prep for the younger inmates.
