At the time I only had the NE corner filled completely, and just a few words elsewhere. But then I thought: OK, I'll give it one more try. And... I filled the grid without outside help! A lot of (intelligent?) guesswork was involved, but I did it and I'm proud.\n\nMy biggest surprise? It took me 20 minutes, which is just a bit slower than a typical Wednesday, and considerably faster than an average Friday. I was so engrossed in the solve time wasn't really registering.\n\nInitially I wanted to complain about all the proper nouns and trivia, but since I managed to complete the puzzle not knowing most of it, it must have been well implemented into the grid - to be gettable with crosses and a bit of creativity. The constructor of this week's obnoxious Wednesday puzzle should learn from Erica Hsiung Wojcik.\n\nNice puzzle, IMO.\n\nLucyfer the puppy is doing great. He is already visibly bigger than he was when he joined our family just over 2 weeks ago. He weighed 9,9 kg then, and now he's up to 11,4 kg. At this rate he will grow to be a really tall standard poodle, which is cool as we like big dogs. The rate at which he learns new things is impressive.
