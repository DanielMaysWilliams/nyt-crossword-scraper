I am curious to know if any other long time puzzle solvers find the same shortcomings I do with current puzzles.  One, they are, other than on Saturday, too easy by far.  Two, they are too repititious, using the same short fill words and phrases --like ado, todo, qasamI, ole, gala, okay, isee,and about 10 others--over and over again.  This suggests to me they rely on AI or computerized searches for input and that is,Three, mechanical, not organic.  This makes me  sad, because it precludes the joy of aha!.

Unfortunately I can't come up with one right now, but I bet you have your favorite.\n\nAlso there is a lot of discussion about the puzzles getting easier over the years.  I'm sure you'll understand is quite deflating to any newer solver who's always wanted to be able to solve NYT weekend puzzles, and finally thought they had done so, only to find out they've been \"dumbed down\".\n\nSo in the olden times, in the 90s and 00s, did a lot of puzzles hinge on marginal spellings of slang?

It feels weird to me though, because in Polish we have the word \"rehabilitacja\" but it means only two things:\n\n1. The process of returning to good health or physical shape, as by physiotherapy and exercise.\n\n2. Restoring a person's good name. For example, all the anti-communist conspirators sentenced to death and executed in the Stalinist era in Poland were rehabilitated after 1989.\n\nA Polish dictionary lists more meanings, but they are effectively dead in modern times, and none has anything even remotely in common with renovations, anyway.\n\nPS. You do some interesting things with my name 🤣. Given how it's spelled, I can't blame you though.","createDate":"1748669910","updateDate":"1748729106","approveDate":"1748669911","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142498622,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142498988","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6508496403694153}

The genre achieved success in the 1990s with the popularity of bands like Helmet, Tool, and Alice in Chains. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal achieved mainstream popularity with the mainstream success of bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, P.O.D., Papa Roach, Disturbed, System of a Down, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Deftones and Staind. After the mid-2000s, nu metal's popularity began to decline, with many nu metal bands moving on to other genres.\n\nI think it's a case of this is a puzzle not a dictionary. I did resist if for a while, but ALT anything can be deduced. Reading the wiki entry, which takes all the enjoyment out of the music, I think grunge can be considered a subset of alt metal.","createDate":"1748676381","updateDate":"1748730700","approveDate":"1748676384","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142498971,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142499253","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6407671570777893}
