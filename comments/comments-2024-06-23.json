My only regret is that all the artists are white males, and I say this with all due respect, being one myself. To find alternatives by women is extremely hard, however, since the  visual arts were historically so male-dominated that very few female artworks have reached that iconic status that would qualify them for inclusion here. Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed is hardly well enough known that cluing it as [Two stamens (1936)] would just irritate everyone. Likewise, [Four butterflies and one eyebrow (1940)] would probably not make Frieda Kahlo's \"Self Portrait With Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird\" spring to mind, plus it's 43 letters. Two non-paint artworks, Dorothea Lange's \"Migrant Mother\" (1936) and Judy Chicago's \"Dinner Party\" (1979) with its iconic 39 place settings probably are famous enough to work, but they ain't paint.  Sadly, if you google most famous artworks by women, more than half of the top results are by men. \n\nLikewise, we all have heard of Basquiat, Jacob Lawrence, Kerry James Marshall, Romare Bearden, and Kara Walker, but how many of us can name a single painting by them that's achieved some status in our collective art consciousness?

I would have been the perfect person to \"test solve\" it over at the NYT because even though what I don't know about Art History would fill every museum in the country, I knew all the titles.  Not only that -- I could envision all of the paintings in my mind's eye.  \n\nBut I didn't know these paintings well enough to count the objects.  Did Michael?\n\nOkay, so I knew that there are two people in AMERICAN GOTHIC and that there is one earring in GIRL WITH A PEAR EARRING.  But the number of orbs?  The number of timepieces?  And most seemingly un-countable of all -- the Basque villagers?\n\nI Googled THE STARRY NIGHT (my first themer in) and tried to count the number of round things in the sky.  But the photo was too small and I wasn't all that sure.  Unless the orange thing in the foreground is also a clock (too blurry online to tell), I could only find three timepieces in THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY.  I decided that trying to count the villagers in GUERNICA would probably be out of the question.\n\nWas Michael able to tell by perusing the Internet?  Is there a reference work that gives you this info?  Or did he go in person to every museum and do his counting there?\n\nWhatever he did, this is an interesting and unusual theme with dense fill.  And it actually teaches you something, too.\n\nOne question for all you Art History majors out there:  Why on earth is a painting of four melted clocks called THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY?

Yesterday, I was almost so proud of myself because I got about 90% of it myself—no helps at all—but I could not bring it all the way home. It took me so long and so many breaks that I didn't even read the comments... especially because I didn't want to see if it was too easy for a lot of folks. When I finally hit \"Check puzzle,\" I had only one thing wrong (TESTErS) but I couldn't work out the last few things.   (MESS KITS, ENTRACTES, and KAPPA.) Oh well, one of these Saturdays...\n\nAs for today, I enjoyed it though I struggled with it more than I usual for Sunday, especially since the theme was straightforward once I got the revealer. I got most of the themes quickly, but I didn't recognize GUERNICA or THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY.

So I went on a little investigation and found out about the newer classification schemes. The protista are such a problematic group, and trying to classify organisms  in a way that makes evolutionary sense, almost demands that some of the algae be lumped in with the land plants. \n\nI would imagine some people also gnashed their teeth at the idea that birds are reptiles, but I wasn't one of them when that came around many years ago. It was obvious that this was the case to anyone familiar with vertebrate evolution. The plant/alga situation is not exactly parallel to the bird/dinosaur/reptile situation, but they are somewhat comparable. \n\nFYI, a case could be made that mammals are also reptiles, but modern re-definitions of reptiles exclude that possibility -- I do wonder if reptiles were redefined merely to exclude the mammals!","createDate":"1719165782","updateDate":"1719235828","approveDate":"1719165784","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134088224,"parentUserDisplayName":"Joe","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134089479","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-23","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5457975268363953}
