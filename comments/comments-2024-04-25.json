I had no issues; I entered \"HOLE\", didn't get the happy music, flyspecked, found a typo, fixed it, and suddenly Ford's in his flivver and I hear the happy music. \"HOLE\" shows up in all appropriate squares in the solved puzzle graphic. But then I read about all the folks who are looking at \"empty\" squares--i.e. \"holes\". So when I get home I look on my chromebook and yes, it doesn't say \"HOLE\", it says... well, nothing. They're all blank.\n\nThe fact that so many people had trouble is... troubling? In the past entering the first letter of a rebus has always been acceptable. Why not today, and on which platforms?  There will always be folks flummoxed by their first rebus, but this was different. \n\nFYI Sam has already said this elsewhere, but for those of you who lost a streak do not despair. email them and ask for your streak back.

The A11 and A12 Checkers were basically unchanged in their design since 1961 and on the streets well into the 1980s, big grilles, raised double headlights on either side that gave the car a pleasantly intelligent, if bored, visage; a ponderous, heavy car with a roomy interior, and a distinct smell, musty seedy notes of wet wool, quiet desperation, cigars, mammalian and boozy, which I found heavenly, at least in my current nostalgic haze. 90 years. I know some of you are close to that (among my favorites here), and she still does the puzzle in pen, rapidly with that confident perfect handwriting; when I visit she might save a few words for me to fill in, never pretending she found them too difficult to do herself, for she prizes honesty above all other virtues, just to share, that's all.

I didn’t even make it halfway through this one and ultimately gave up. For a novice crossword puzzler, this was quite difficult. \n\nMy rule of thumb on whether I keep trucking through (or quit and have the app reveal the entire puzzle without me completing it) is based on how much I’ve relied on the various clue helper sites to determine that clue’s answer. I champion the creators for requiring Internet assistance to look up various locations, specie names, or antonyms/synonyms for various words. I don’t count that as assistance because I’m learning. I’ve only been actively solving or puzzles for about a month now, so I know, I still have a lots of word and figure out, but this was not one of my enjoyable puzzles.
