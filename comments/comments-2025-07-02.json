It has never been the most common spelling, but it has been in continuous use from the 1890s onward.  It had peaks in the 1900s and the 1950s, when it registered at just above half (1907) and just below half (1954) the frequency of its counterpart with a J.  See the Google Ngram for details.\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/mr4yc27p\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/mr4yc27p</a>\n\nAs you can see in the Ngram, usage of NAVAHO has trailed off considerably in the 21st century, but it's still seen occasionally.\n\nNote that the Ngram measures usage in books, so these are edited works.  For words like NAVA(H/J)O that have unambiguous meanings, Ngrams are highly accurate.\n\nAlso, please note that among the Diné people, it doesn't seem to cause a big uproar how we non-Natives spell the other word.  And they don't seem to take much offense over it, either.\n\nAlso important, you should note that the [Var.] notation, not freely given these days, is in force, telling you to look for a less common version of the word.\n\nSo please tread lightly when you have an opinion that you haven't researched a little before stating it.","createDate":"1751462825","updateDate":"1751542437","approveDate":"1751462825","recommendations":24,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143247321","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.85025954246521}

And 23A had to be either GRAPHICDETAIL or BANKSTATEMENT.\n\nAs an experience constructor, Mr. Caprera would have considered the various possible placements for these four entries *before* attempting to fill the the non-thematic portions of the grid.\n\nI can only assume that his experience (and, perhaps, his software) suggested that PUBTRIVIA at 17A and GRAPHICDETAIL at 23A was the most promising of the four options he had.\n\nGiven that, our constructor then needs to fill 6D with something fitting the pattern ??V?H?. What would you put there? I don't have professional software and a word list on hand, but I can't imagine there are many (any?) options other than NAVAHO.\n\nSo what to do? Discard or reject the puzzle simply because it's NAVAHO (Var.) and not NAVAJO?\n\nMaybe folks should consider how challenging it is to construct a puzzle as solid as this one.\n\n(That said, if we had WOAH in the grid, well in that case ...)","createDate":"1751465946","updateDate":"1751510459","approveDate":"1751465946","recommendations":18,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143249293","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.854034960269928}

Varsity?  Variegated?\n\nI think that \"Var.\" has been used so rarely lately that younger/newer solvers have never seen it before, but come on!  You couldn't figure it out?  Seriously?\n\nThe last time NAVAHO appeared was about 15 years ago; it was a frequent entry at one time.  Today was the first time it appeared with a \"Var.\"  Fifteen years ago, it wasn't as much the variant that it now is.  \n\nPay mind to the setting of the clue: the WWII code breakers.  In that era, spelling it with an H was quite a bit more common.  Never the more common spelling, but seen often enough not to evoke the rage seen here today.  \n\nThis is a skill issue.  The clue is perfectly pitched for the answer:  NAVAHO is indeed a now-rare but once-common variant spelling, well documented during WWII, and reaching a peak around 1957, when it was about half as common as the J-version, but very much in use.\n\nAnd though you didn't bring it up, others have:  yes, the  Native name for themselves is Diné; however, NAVAHO and NAVAJO are not considered slurs, and the land they are sovereign to is called the Navajo Nation, not the Diné Nation.  There have been efforts to change it, but the majority of the people prefer not to.  One reason is that Diné just means \"the people,\" and can mean human beings in general.
