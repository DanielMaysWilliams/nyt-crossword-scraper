As a person who loves an ad hominem attack, as long as it's not directed at me or anyone I respect, like or love, I don't think they're all fallacious. Sometimes a person is simply so odious that going all A-hom on them is totally reasonable & rational. \n\nCrazy, but I actually knew Laura Dershewitz's name as an author of one of my grand-niece's favorite books: \"The House That Cleaned Itself: The True Story of Frances Gabe's (Mostly) Marvelous Invention\" -- a kid's book that came out a few years ago about a real inventor's madcap ideas which she turned into reality. Dershewitz is, if I remember, the main author. It's a lovely book, wonderful illustrations, and my niece, who was seven at the time we gave it to her, still references it at age nine when it's time to clean the dishes. \"I wish Frances Gabe were here to help!\" I recommend it for the kids in your life.\n\nSecond favorite nun joke (one of many variations):\n\nA woman joins a convent that requires a vow of silence, allowing nuns only two spoken words a decade.\n\nTen years pass. The nun tells the Mother Superior, \"Room cold.\" They give her a heater.\n\nTen more years go by and she says, \"Bed hard.\" They give her a new mattress.\n\nTen more years go by. \"Food bad.\" They change her DIET PLAN.\n\nTen more years go by and the nun says, \"I quit.\" The Mother Superior says, \"Fine by me.

Much slower than my average.  Some scattered thoughts:\n\nAfter solving the puzzle, it was a truly “D’oh!” moment for me in not appreciating, until I read Sam’s Wordplay column, the constructors’ brilliance in using the homonymic phrase — there probably never was such a thing until now — “ad hominem” as a stand-in for “add homonym”.\n\nTsk, tsk on Sam for virtually splitting an infinitive: “How to not” instead of “How not to”.\n\nSorrey to all you American folk, but as one of this crowd has already correctly pointed out, “story” is not how you spell the word that describes one of several levels of a building (or of anything else, for that matter).  “Storey” it is and you will always lose two marks for a spelling error when I am grading your test paper.  I don’t care what your story is in defence (not “defense”) of your carelessness or ignorance.\n\nThis reprimand will no doubt annoy many of you, in the same way I was upset with my high school Latin teacher who gave me 98 by taking two marks off my spring exam paper for translating “wood” as “silvae” instead of “silva”.  And to add insult to injury, she gave me a final course grade of only 99, by averaging it with the perfect 100 I had scored on the fall exam.","createDate":"1711448313","updateDate":"1711509327","approveDate":"1711448316","recommendations":8,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132101278","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-26","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6334354877471924}

I was not sure how the revealer was supposed to work, exactly. Add homonym, indeed!\n\nAs always, my problem had to do with a different pronunciation of the same phrase in the US and in Poland. Apparently we pronounce AD HOMINEM differently than English speakers do, and as we say it it definitely does not sound like \"add homonym.\" There was also the problem I wrote about below - in Polish a homophone is not a kind of homonym. E.g. \"zamek\" means both a castle and a lock, and thus we are dealing with a homonym. \"Bóg\" (god), Bug (proper name of one of our largest rivers, akin to the Ukrainian Boh), and buk (beech) sound exactly the same, but mean very different things, and thus we are dealing with homophones rather than homonyms.\n\nI had Latin classes in High School. The teacher discussed with us the issue of Latin pronunciation. I have no idea if what I learned almost 30 years ago is still considered true, but we were told that nobody knows how ancient Romans pronounced their Latin, and the most common, modern pronunciation was influenced by Italian, due to the Catholic Church's use of Latin and its links to Italy. Ancient Latin may have sounded more like ancient Greek, with its song-like quality. The teacher asked us to abandon the Italian pronunciation and just use a standard Polish one - obviously not an English one.\n\nWho could have predicted that three decades later that would make a NYT puzzle harder for me?","createDate":"1711442307","updateDate":"1711576221","approveDate":"1711442310","recommendations":25,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132100350,"parentUserDisplayName":"Janine","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132100523","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6077800989151001}

According to Merriam-Webster:\n\nWhat are homonyms, homophones, and homographs?\n\nHomonym can be troublesome because it may refer to three distinct classes of words. Homonyms may be words with identical pronunciations but different spellings and meanings, such as to, too, and two. Or they may be words with both identical pronunciations and identical spellings but different meanings, such as quail (the bird) and quail (to cringe). Finally, they may be words that are spelled alike but are different in pronunciation and meaning, such as the bow of a ship and bow that shoots arrows. The first and second types are sometimes called homophones, and the second and third types are sometimes called homographs—which makes naming the second type a bit confusing. Some language scholars prefer to limit homonym to the third type.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homonym#:~:text=Homonyms\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homonym#:~:text=Homonyms</a>\n\nHope this helps!","createDate":"1711477133","updateDate":"1711523388","approveDate":"1711477135","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132109438,"parentUserDisplayName":"Detroit","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132114727","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8725453019142151}

Many people here and in the wide world falsely remember it otherwise.\n\nI have been going through the archives in order, deliberately strictly in order. I am now in mid-May 1998 (five years into Will Shortz’ editorship), and there is as yet no sign whatsoever of the fabled progression and order.\n\nRebuses on any day; tricks on any day; themes/themeless on any day; easy or hard on any day. That’s the reality.\n\nYes, Sundays are 21x21 and the others usually 15x15. Yes, Sunday usually has a special theme and Saturday is usually very hard (but definitely as likely themed as themeless). But I’m still on the lookout for when what people think is law carved on stone tablets may appear.","createDate":"1711487186","updateDate":"1711656534","approveDate":"1711548752","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132106986,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eddie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132119506","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7787437438964844}
