Alas, as is often the case, American brands and abbreviations were my undoing.\n\nSurprise, surprise - I have no idea what a metal producer based in Pittsburgh may be called. The abbreviation for a member of a conference had me stumped, too.\n\nWhy do these two things matter?\n\nBecause PROCESSIONS CONfEctIONS looked like it made sense, as did ALfOA (as much sense as a letter-salad brand name may ever make, anyway; it looks no less reasonable than ALCOA to me). Almost never being able to figure out American abbreviations, I didn't even think what cCH might be. Of course, I should have paid more attention to General TSO, one of Crosslandia's favorites, who ended up being TtO in my version, but I was too fixated on CONfEctIONS being correct.\n\nAlso, I've never heard of either TO POT and PRAT (as clued today). I had TO rOT there, and the nonsensical rRAT. I accepted it though, parsed as r RAT - that looks vaguely like it might mean something.\n\nThe thing is, the Sunday grids are so big that when I don't get a gold star I just can't be bothered to look for mistakes. So today, after 1 hour and 2 minutes of solo efforts, I used autocheck to reveal my errors. Not caring about my streak is such a blessing - it saves me so much grief! \n\nBTW, in Polish \"konferencja\" only ever means conference as an event for people coming together to talk about science or business.

Fast and fun! Very light-hearted theme and fill, and who couldn't use a little light-heartedness these days!?\n\nRe THETAOOFPOOH, It was the first thing I thought of, but I couldn't remember the author's name to verify it and my copy is in a different room so I couldn't just casually stretch and look over at the bookshelf...  So I rejected putting it in for a long time because it couldn't possibly have been from 1982! \n\nLater, when I happily realized it had to be that, I remembered that the copy I have was given to me by a friend was in like 1990... So 1982 was entirely possible. My sense of time these days is so outrageously out of whack. It doesn't seem like it could be that long ago. \n\nAnyhow it made me smile and I was happy to plug it in and be wrong! \n\nMy husband asked me today how old our nephew is now, my response was, \"The real question is how old am I?\" He was able to answer that and all we have to do is subtract 30 years and two days and that's how old my nephew is. \n\nAnyhoooooo....  Nice puzzle. Very close to being my fastest ever, but I found I had some little error where DRINKYPOO AND POSY crossed, so looking for that took up too much time.
