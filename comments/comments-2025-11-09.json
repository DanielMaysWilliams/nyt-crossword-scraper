Don’t get me wrong, I love rebus puzzles, and I very much appreciate two way rebus puzzles—but there has to be some rhyme or reason to it, and the title “Swing States” and the revealer WESTERNUNION just doesn’t cut it for me, especially for a big Sunday puzzle and only four rebuses. For one thing for a two way rebus, once you get one direction it should give you a hint to the other direction, which isn’t the case here (unless you are going to run every Western state abbreviation, which I had to at MOMTOBE since I didn’t remember HBCUs). Maybe, maybe if they were bordering states it could pass, but just because they are all Western states is not enough justification. I didn’t think the themed entries—or the majority of the puzzle, for that matter—were that sparkling enough either (although I smiled at IMNOTAKIDANYMORE). The editors are usually very stingy about passing two way rebuses, I’m surprised this one got through.

But that's where my fun ended.\n\nThe grid was very naticky for me in places. Despite my best efforts several areas of it were largely empty so I started looking up my unknowns. The cluster of the film quote, geometry term, something related to American sport, and a Hebrew feature was my undoing. I sort of knew the quote - I've never seen \"Taxi driver\", but that line from it featured in one of Poland's most popular comedies of the 1990s, \"Killer\", or maybe its sequel. I entered Ya TALKIN TO ME. It looked good enough, as did the resulting ISaGON. The sporting thing was a huge enigma though (the missing letter in DO_, the Hebrew thing, was no help at all) so I looked it up... And spoiled the final rebus square in the process 🫤\n\nNow, maybe the above was my personal experience only, but I really dislike it when a rebus falls on the cross of two entries I perceive as trivia. \n\nI like rebuses in general, but once I had unwittingly spoiled the solve for myself, I just revealed the rest of the puzzle 🤷🏽.\n\nAlso, what's a flippin' HBCUS???","createDate":"1762668710","updateDate":"1762769624","approveDate":"1762668712","recommendations":12,"replyCount":33,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146518921","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5651307702064514}

There are no indicators, like circles, to give that away, and the puzzle’s title certainly didn’t holler “Rebus!”\n\nSecond, finding the rebuses.  They are not symmetrical, or only in the longest answers.\n\nThird, seeing that each rebus square has two elements.  A double-element rebus is a layer more difficult than a single element one. And figuring out, thanks to the puzzle’s title, that the elements were state postal codes.\n\nI’ll continue with what I liked most of all.  \n\nThere I was, after figuring out the above, filling boxes in, workman-like. \n\nThen I uncovered WESTERN UNION.  Hah! – Now THAT was a special moment, combining surprise – that there was an in-grid revealer at all (Sundays often don't have them), not to mention that I hadn’t realized that the states were all in the West – and delight at its scintillating wordplay.  \n\nFor a moment, the air filled with sparks and the puzzle went from being good to being sublime.\n\nYou happified my brain’s workout ethic, plus you surprised, and wonderfully tricked me, Amie.

The problem was that I had entered my answers in the form NM|OR, which the puzzle refused to accept as a correct answer. After looking over all my answers, I went back and tried different formats for the rebus squares. The problem is that I can never remember the valid rebus format.\n\nIdeally, the online puzzle should have a better rebus-entering interface. Some rebuses are a cluster of letters that work in both directions, and some are like today, where it is a pair. The interface should allow us to choose which kind we are entering, and display the square appropriately, such as a diagonal line with the two answers in the NW/SE corner, or perhaps an alternating display like you see with the completed puzzle. Having four or more letters horizontally makes it extremely difficult to read.\n\nI realize this is a bit a of a programming task, so a much easier way of making our lives better would be to just have the puzzle validator ignore all non-alpha characters in your answer. We should be able to enter : , * / | # - or really anything to separate our pairs. This is also a simple one-line code change and doesn't require any new UI elements, and would work the same for all platforms the puzzle software runs on.","createDate":"1762700518","updateDate":"1762706259","approveDate":"1762700519","recommendations":4,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146523188","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.449242502450943}

Voters at the poll actually vote for these electors, who are pledged to the candidates.  Sometimes, the candidate with the most overall votes loses, because the other candidate has more electors.\n\nAt this point in our history, most states are reliably Democrat or Republican.  Those that can go either way are called \"swing states,\" and of course, that's where the candidates campaign most.   \n\nBut more importantly for this puzzle, you don't need to know any of that.  All you need to know is that the title is a hint to how the puzzle is solved.  \"Swing States\" tells me that you have to put a different state code in each direction to solve the puzzle.

I just turned 78, yesterday, and I've usually lived at least 800 or more miles away, and only been back a couple of times since then, so no reinforcement for NYC news, neighborhoods, or other city-specific features over the last 60 years.\n\nIt took me a little while to get over my initial resentment about the NYC-specific clues, but then I realized that the main focus for the paper is, and should be, the NYC and metro area population, even though it's available in print in many other locations, and available for anyone online.\n\nOne positive is that usually the NYC-USA-specific content is discoverable/discernible via the crosses, which has made the correct answers appear in more than one instance for me. When it isn't, and the crosses don't cooperate, I feel there is no shame or streak-breaking by doing some research to find an answer, like the recent \"controversial sculpture in a specific park\" clue.

And yeah, I see how the tone of the rebus page could irk someone who is already annoyed, but it’s meant humorously (angering subscribers isn’t a good business model) and given a little time I think you’ll be able to read it that way and even look back with a smile on today because, again, this is something of a rite of passage for nyt puzzlers.

The MLB All Star Game still has fans decide the starting position players. I think part of why it avoids being all Yankees & Dodgers is that enough people actually vote based on who they think is deserving, not just their favorite team or players. Also, the newest voting format involves two rounds with a limited number of players to choose from in the second round (three for infield & DH & I can’t remember how many outfield). I believe the first level of backups is decided by a player vote. The All Star managers then fill out the rosters with a few more position players & all the pitchers. (The rosters are larger than 26 players.)  \n\nOther American sports have fan votes count as a percentage of the votes for starters or something like that.
