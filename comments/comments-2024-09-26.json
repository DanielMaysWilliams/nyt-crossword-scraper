Well, today proved me wrong. I enjoyed this puzzle greatly, and for many reasons.\n\nFirst, the construction was impressive. I was amazed by the themed entries being actual words when arranged both ways - I can remember a puzzle from a few weeks ago where some of the themers were gibberish when read this way or that. No such clunky problems today. Truly awesome 🤩\n\nSecond, the theme was sport-based, and American sport, too, yet I dealt with it 💪🏾!Obviously I had no idea what the revealer might be right off the bat (please appreciate the baseball idiom. Soon I'll be an Ameircan. Too bad I couldn't think of a football expression to better match the grid). However, crosses gave me what could only have been the word REVERSE, and everything clicked into place. The theme helped me with the fill, which happens rarely for me and was most enjoyable.\n\nThird, there wasn't as much trivia as there sometimes is on Thursday, and what little of it there was I mostly knew. Finally I remembered KOTB and IDA without Googling! I did lookup the Greek letter and that Latin term for the thing under your nose though. \n\nFourth, RUNUP ties in nicely with today's article in The Guardian on UK terms in US English: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/26/other-british-invasion-how-uk-language-conquered-the-us?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/26/other-british-invasion-how-uk-language-conquered-the-us?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other</a>\n\nWho knew Thursdays could be as great as this.

Maybe I get it.\n\nThere's a restaurant I like to go to but I only like one thing on the menu.  They serve it every day except Thursday, when the chef likes to be a big showoff and make something that is too clever by half. I mean, it's not even what I consider to be \"real\" food, just some weird hybrid they try to pass off as a meal.  Just to spite everyone, I go each Thursday and get the \"special\" dish, and of course, I don't like it.  I then complain about my meal  and loudly bemoan the fact that my favorite dish is unavailable on Thursday.  I often get angry and say things that other diners (who seem to love this nonsensical excuse for food) label as \"unkind\".  I let them know that the chef is lazy and the support staff is incompetent for allowing this poor excuse for cooking.  I'm sure you'll find this hard to believe, but some people actually seem to think that *I* am the problem.  I'd like to make them understand that I'm right and that the chef's real goal is to make me feel unsophisticated, but they are all just so smug and self-satisfied that it might just be beyond them.","createDate":"1727348592","updateDate":"1727660896","approveDate":"1727348594","recommendations":111,"replyCount":22,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136453287","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-26","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6445329785346985}

They are more complicated than being simply anagrams, as they involve turned-around letters in specific places.  Did you write a computer program?  Did you search words manually hoping to find candidates?\n\nThird, did you come up with additional theme answers?  This seems like a tight theme, and I’m guessing it is, because worthy alternative theme answers aren't showing up in the comments, but my guess could be wrong.\n\nJesse – can you chime in here?  Crossnerd me, and I’m guessing others, would find the answers very interesting.  \n\nI love this theme, Jesse.  I love word quirk themes, so you pushed my happy button today.

The revealer is DOUBLE REVERSE, which is a hint to reverse both groups of shaded letters.  The gimmick answers are also real words, but don't connect to the clues per se, only when the transformations are made.\n\nThis is the kind of puzzle to be on the lookout for on Thursdays, when the tricky puzzles come out.  When words fit but don't answer the clue, you can just enter the answers that work with the crosses and move on, expecting that in the end, it'll all make sense.\n\nFor a puzzle like this, there will always be a revealer that will point you in the direction of what to do.  (Yesterday's slightly tricky puzzle had not one, not two, but three revealers!)\n\nOnce you realize that Thursday puzzles are often offbeat and tricky in different ways every time, you're prepared for them.

Your analogy would advise that those who know they won't like the Thursday puzzle should just skip it instead of doing it and getting mad about it (e.g. why go to the restaurant on Thursday?!)\n\nBut the true analogy is that you purchased a special meal plan with the restaurant to serve you dinner every night of the week and you are continually annoyed with the Thursday menu.  If you buy the subscription for NYT Games, you expect to be able to play them every day... it's not like you get to choose 1 day each week to complete the puzzle and these poor souls keep trying the Thursday hoping it will be different.\n\nShould the same cast of characters complain and moan about Thursday knowing that Thursday is purpose-built to be different?

That is a difficult enough feat of construction that it should be admired in its own right, and IMO makes for an excellent and NYT-worthy puzzle.\n\nIn some other similar cases, solvers have suggested maybe hinting at both answers in the clue.

The quarterback takes the ball and starts running with it in one direction.  He then hands the ball to a teammate running in the opposite direction. If done correctly, this throws off the defense's balance, and it leads to a big gain.  This is known as a reverse.\n\nA DOUBLE REVERSE is when all the above happens, and then the second ball carrier hands the ball off again to yet another teammate, who runs again in the opposite direction, which is to say, the original direction that the quarterback started running.  The hope is that the defense will be so off-balance by then that a huge gain will be gotten.  \n\nOf course, a good defense knows when to be on the lookout for such a play, but it often works with the right personnel.\n\nSometimes, just a fake of a handoff to another player will throw the defense off enough for a substantial gain.","createDate":"1727321906","updateDate":"1727538386","approveDate":"1727321909","recommendations":23,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136451059","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-26","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.544173538684845}

Recent ones include the rebus squares being [PB/AU] representing the alchemical transmutation of lead to gold, and one where the across part was a playing card value and the down part was a suit (e.g.  JACK/HEART) representing a single playing card en each rebus, with the rebi taken together forming a poker hand.\n\nIn this case, a rebus was not necessary, and I think the simpler/more elegant solution without rebuses makes more sense. But I like the idea of seeing both the clued and unclued answers in the grid. 🤓\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/crosswords/rebus-crossword-puzzle.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/crosswords/rebus-crossword-puzzle.html</a>","createDate":"1727355122","updateDate":"1727364623","approveDate":"1727355126","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136452781,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shrike","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136454992","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6464617252349854}

When someone says \"Impossible\" baldly and unadorned, it sounds to me like a peremptory judgement.  As it is clearly not impossible, other information should be included, otherwise why comment.  I am, for example, always interested to hear why people find things difficult or impossible for them.  Note the words \"to me\" above.
