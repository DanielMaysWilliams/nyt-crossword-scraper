For example, if the tying run comes home on an error (or even because of an error earlier in the inning), it's a blown save, but the ERA of the pitcher is unchanged.\n\nIf a pitcher blows a save, his ERA usually goes up.

In 2023, 91 constructors made their debuts.\n\nAnother way to look at it: In 2000, more than 30 percent of the published puzzles were from the six most frequently published constructors: Manny Nosowsky (24 puzzles), Rich Norris (22), Nancy Salomon (21), Elizabeth Gorski (17), Peter Gordon (17) and Joe DiPietro (15). The last year that anyone had more than 20 puzzles published was 2019; Erik Agard had 21 that year. In 2023, the most frequently published constructor was Jeff Chen, with only 10 puzzles.\n\nWith so many more people submitting puzzles and being published, I think it’s inevitable that the quality of grids is going up. Editors are selecting just their favorite 3 percent to 5 percent of submissions, which means we can afford to be pickier. Especially with themeless puzzles, we tend to avoid grids with too many obscure entries, because there are so many quality options to choose from.","createDate":"1726245486","updateDate":"1726501559","approveDate":"1726245489","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136164964,"parentUserDisplayName":"Marie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136167221","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9038920402526855}
