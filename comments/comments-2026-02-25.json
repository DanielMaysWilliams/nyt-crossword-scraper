I’m sorry that technical problems soured this for some people, I did fine by assuming the picture stood for the letter and not filing anything in there; I would have thought they would have treated them like black squares and not allow you to fill anything there if that’s what they wanted. So if that messed people up that’s a shame.\nBecause I thought this was a pretty layered theme. At first I didn’t noticed the shaded areas and just thought we were replacing letterings with gymnastic moves. But in addition you had three very nice themers with hidden dances broken up by the letters which was nicely done, and a very clever revealer.\nI’m also surprised everyone found this so easy. Not hard for me for a Wednesday by any means but at least average. Notice the double 10 stacks on either side in addition to the theme which is pretty unusual for a Wednesday and some clever clues—sound-track for ECHOLOCATE in particular, and CTSCAN for “healthy self image”.

An amusing irony considering the technical issue. \n\nI  very much enjoyed the clever theme and the artistic vibe of the puzzle. VINCENT VAN GOGH, the inner BALLET of HANNIBAL LECTER (picture that, if you will), and the “sound-track” of MADONNA, HIHAT and CLEFS. \n\nOn Sunday, in the midst of a blizzard, I saw The Sleeping Beauty ballet, which was a magical experience. Perhaps the lingering high from that experience made me enjoy the dancing silhouettes even more.\n\nA lovely puzzle, thanks Brad!","createDate":"1772013027","updateDate":"1772053293","approveDate":"1772013030","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149136685","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8877646327018738}

At the first place where I encountered one of the small images, I tried entering the T in CREDIT SCORE but when no T showed up in my gird, I decided that the trick was to let the dancing images just stand in for the letters. When I finished the grid, not filling in any of the other squares with images in them, I got the close but no cigar message, then spent five minutes going over and over and over the grid. When I found no errors, I broke down and looked at the completed grid the Wordplay column links to just to finish the thing...and found no errors, and the squares with the dancing images are blank. Finally, I decided to try treating each of the three squares as a rebus, but with only one letter in it...and got the star.\n\nWhat puzzles me is that if we were to do that, enter a letter in those squares, since I did not even try to enter a letter in the \"dancing squares\" at 29A and 46A, but there needed to be something there, why did the puzzle give me message that I had completed the grid but had errors message...and why did the model grid show blanks in those three squares?\n \nAside from that, the puzzle was fairly easy -- even with spending five minute searching for errors, I still finished roughly 30 percent under my Wednesday average.\n\nI did want to say that I appreciated the juxtaposition of 31D and 32D (HEAR and HUSH)...and also the cluing for 11D (\"Sound-track?\") for ECHOLOCATE.","createDate":"1772030543","updateDate":"1772030998","approveDate":"1772030545","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149143003","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5780930519104004}

I can be a little slow but I realized that I could find out whether there was a problem by checking the comments. I did think to order them according to the number of responses. But I had already done what people were saying worked for them. Since I was working on my (Android) tablet using the games app, I decided to try something else.

It's not like this is the Connections where made up words are tolerated. ;-)\n\nFor all the folks who got stuck with the glitch - I ask for grace for the Gameplay team. The crossword started in 1942 as a diversion for the American people after Pearl Harbor.  \n\n54 years later, the first NYT crossword for the web was introduced in 1996 - it was a sign that the Times was embracing and not trying to bury their head in the sand, about what the world wide web was going to mean to their industry. \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/14/crosswords/new-york-times-crossword-timeline.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/14/crosswords/new-york-times-crossword-timeline.html</a> \n\nThe web itself has upped the ante for all content creators to embrace gimmicks and stunts, and the Times is trying to keep up while still maintaining its intellectual standards. I am going to guess that most of us are tail end boomers and early gen xers - The Times needs to fill the pipeline of later generation users and that means embracing the trends. They had 54 years to perfect the paper crossword puzzle, and we need to allow them room for error as they embrace technology.","createDate":"1772036859","updateDate":"1772036860","approveDate":"1772036860","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":149139987,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shaun","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149147514","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7669351100921631}
