It's rare for me to not have some tiny error in the big ole Sunday grid, but today I got the gold star right away. \n\nI was wondering if the theme was going to be wedding-related somehow because I first had idoS at 43 across, though VOWS still allowed me to keep my theme in mind. And I originally had SAYSyes at 74 across before changing it to SAYSIDO, which is what made me go back and change 43 across...  We also had AMO, ALOHA, and LOVETO and even SENTIMENTS to make me feel warm and fuzzy. \n\nAnyhow, I'll just let it be a little mini romantic theme in my head for the I Think Knot theme and what(k)not.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the clue for NINELIVES at 107 across.\n\nI'm grateful that puzzles typically give me a complete respite from the ANGST of current events and other life difficulties. There were a few non warm and fuzzy things in this one that jarred me out of puzzle mode into unhappily thinking of current events but I know that the puzzles are done in advance and they can't predict what will come or when so I don't fault anyone.

I am just now finally getting a moment to say so. \n\nI think the thing that impressed me the most was the rather unusually large volume of 3-letter answers, and that so many of them were surprisingly fresh! (Either the words themselves or the clues to more typical answers.) I happened to enjoy all the measurement terminology, almost a mini theme: the adacent AMP, OHM, PSI and then BTU down the grid. These and other tiny words made way for some really nice long answers! \n\nI first tried CATlike and then found CATTISH awkward... But by the time I read Caitlin's writeup, I realized I really like it as a word. Going into regular rotation for this cat lady! ;) \n\nAt the opposite end of the puzzle -- and puzzling -- I was happily shocked that YOGA MAT was correct on the first go! Most of this puzzle was like that for me, making for a fairly perfect Sunday solving experience, IMO. \n\nI will just add that the incendiary clues and answers in the middle of the grid made me mentally wince, given the horrible situation in southern California this week. Publishing schedule constraints are not something I've given much thought to 'til now, but I'd imagine there wasn't a way to modify those clues.

For people to say what they like and don't like, yes. Definitely. In addition, if someone is a puzzle constructor themselves, then it makes sense that they could offer usable, realistic suggestions. (I am not, and find I understand about as much about puzzle construction as I do about oral surgery. I can voice my opinion about my experience of it, however.) \n\nIt's hard to see how criticizing a puzzle as \"lazily constructed,\" for instance, would be helpful, and it's unpleasant to read. It just comes across as wanting to tear someone down rather than wanting to help them \"perfect the product.\" All of these puzzles are created by unpaid volunteers, and I hope that doesn't change. It means we will continue to have a variety of solving experiences--we never know what to expect each day.\n\nMuch of the criticism I see here would appeal to only a part of the puzzle solving public, which prompts others to chime in to balance things out.
