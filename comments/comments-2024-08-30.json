And the neologism \"VEEPstakes\" made for a post-solve look-up.\n\nYesterday we had OSCAR WILDE; today we had (A)ESTHETE (how I wanted to enter the digraph √Ü as a rebus!) Yesterday we had TOGAE, which prompted my comment about assassins hiding daggers in theirs; today BRUTUS made his appearance.\n\n***   ***\n\nThe novelist/poet Robert Graves and I have difficulty thinking of \"Psyche and Eros\" as a genuine myth--in the sense of a shared cultural meme. Rather, it's a contrived allegory of the Soul and Desire, most of the details (full of PLOT_HOLES, dontcha know) invented by the Roman novelist Apuleius. At the end of story, after all Psyche's trials, Hermes, in his role of psychopomp, conducts her up into Olympus, and to her wedding with Eros. How pretty!\n\nMy close friend Tom--a composer and painter--recently passed away. In his will, he bequeathed me a painting which he titled \"Chromapotheosis,\" itself a deconstruction of the marble of Hermes and Psyche, by 19th c. sculptor Reinhold Begas, which stands in the National Gallery in Berlin (<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/6bprxxb6\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/6bprxxb6</a>). It hangs proudly in our living room. \n\nSo you see, I have a bit of emotional attachment to the story.","createDate":"1725026219","updateDate":"1725069661","approveDate":"1725026223","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135825708","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-30","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6279417872428894}
