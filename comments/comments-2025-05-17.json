Meh. This was an ideal example of the kind of puzzle that's personally hard for me in the most unenjoyable kind of way - much like last week's Sunday was.

I have no idea what ACC may be, where Miami is supposed to be.\n\nCultural references were my undoing, too. SLIMED? I had Nickelodeon on satellite tv in the early 90s. My parents had a satellite dish installed on the tiny balcony of our apartment (with a pirated card in the decoder 🤣; almost nobody here  could afford Western subscriptions then, and they weren't even offered to us Slavic pariahs for years) despite financial difficulties most Poles shared at the time - to let me watch TV in English. However, I never liked Nickelodeon much. There was something about it... I don't know... Uncouth? Boring, nerdy preteen and teen Andrzej preferred Nat Geo, Star Trek on British Sky TV, and the odd bare bosom on late-night German channels. I wasn't popular at school 🤣\n\nMy grid is punctuated by the red marks of reveals - once I realized how much arcana there was, I did not even bother to look things up. My few gimmes (ARLO Parks of the angelic voice and moving lyrics; Rita ORA; OMAN) helped little.\n\nBtw. RIDES UP was a gimme, too. For years I struggled with underpants riding up my legs during climbing, and bunching up under the harness. Under Armour Performance underpants were the answer.

Always a good reason to stop and consider the peripatetic orthographies of our (largely) bilingual continent. If only the IPA had been around when Hernán Cortés (*not* Cortez) was pillaging and plundering young Mexico-to-be while  Spanish chroniclers were MacGyvering their own ad hoc system of transcribing Nahuatl with the Latin alphabet and monastic spelling, er, habits. Just think: They could’ve just preserved mexcalli as /meʃˈkalːi/ (or something very close to that), then sat back and waited. Presto, a few centuries go by and, poof! the Spanish monks are gone, and we Americans can start spelling /meʃˈkalːi/ as meshcali as we take the Southwest for ourselves. No messing around with mexcalli/mezcal/mescal and its, er, prickly etymology. Then we just call it mesh—because if there’s one national trait we all share, it’s to compulsively abbreviate everything. Obvi. \n\nNot a bad Saturday, though a quick one. A whole spanner dedicated to a sitcom? That always seems like a wasted opportunity to me, but I’m shouting into the wind as usual.

So many long gimmes without needing any crosses: 6D BANANA SPLIT came first with no crosses.

TEES brings to mind a photo of my brother playing tee ball in the 70s.\n\nFor others, I was on the right track but needed more crosses to get the exact phrase: was pretty sure 3D had something to do with Amazon, 11D had to be a convenience store at a gas station (was that subliminally suggested by 17A?), 41D was probably something you use or take for a cold, and 36A had something to do with a wedgie. (Very surprised and delighted no one's complained about the impropriety of that one, or maybe I just haven't seen it.)\n\nI even reasoned out some sports references. ASTROS are from Houston, right? A star and an H make sense. The RAVENS are obviously named for POE. That one should have been a straight gimme because I do live in Maryland, but it wasn't a gimme because sports.\n\nThe stickiest section was NE.

The old system had been in crisis for years, and then it collapsed, leaving a mess that took years to sort out. Living standards dropped year after year before they finally began to recover, and then improve. It's very hard for me to think of any of us enjoying any particular advantages then.

Sitcoms about family-owned small businesses are common and often feature a business name, like “Cheers” or “Bob’s Burgers.” The clue’s use of the term corner store, which is a little uncommon, suggests the deliberate avoidance of a more common synonym. There are a few of these, like mini-mart (used elsewhere in the puzzle) or bodega (but this is in Canada, not New York). Convenience store is such a synonym, one widely used throughout the English-speaking world. I wouldn’t have guessed it without crossings, but the clues providing the C and the V were fair and after that CONVENIENCE jumped out. That left four letters, with a good chance of being a name, possibly a possessive. We know the family is Korean, which has a small set of surnames, the most common being Kim, which is often in the news. KIM’S CONVENIENCE offers the charm of alliteration. Crossings confirm it. I know this is long, but I offer it only as an example of something I see all the time, apparent trivia that offers a fighting chance even when one lacks particular knowledge. A smattering of general knowledge, broad but shallow, can carry the day. Being old helps. And it seems to me that the constructors and editors are sensitive to accusations of too much trivia and try not to be tricky with these.","createDate":"1747487888","updateDate":"1747570605","approveDate":"1747487888","recommendations":29,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142190116,"parentUserDisplayName":"spurious","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142192284","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8496578335762024}
