As such, they often inaccurate as concerns completeness or chronology. For instance, Vivaldi wrote hundreds of concerti (along with operas, sacred music, etc.), but only a few dozen were published in twelve opus-numbered collections. As far as chronology, the symphonies of Dvorak and Bruckner are particularly messy. And if a composer dealt with more than one publisher, things could get very confusing.\n\nA better system are the catalogues done by musicologists for most major composers--more complete, more accurate, and besides, you get to name the catalogue after yourself. Thus Hoboken XXI:3 (*The Seasons*, by Haydn); Schickele 1/2tsp. (*The Seasonings*, by Bach)(RIP). But even these catalogues present problems--musicologists are constantly revising the scholarship, new manuscripts are discovered. And the rivalries!: in the case of Dominico Scarlatti, there are *four* competing catalogues!\n\nAt least in academic discussion, no musicologist would use the term \"Opuses\"--the plural is \"Opera\"--abbreviated \"Opp.\"--as in \"Opera omnia\", an edition of the complete works of a composer.\n\nAh, Musicology! No wonder HESSE imagined it as the best preliminary study toward mastering The Glass Bead Game!

(I am speculating that it is due to the crosses facilitated by a four-letter word that has this many vowels.)\n\nWhile it may be common knowledge south of the border, I was fascinated recently to hear about the history of the OREO cookie; particularly that it was a knock-off of an earlier cookie comprised of intricately embossed chocolate wafers sandwiching a sweet white filling.  The original was a cookie that went by the name “Hydrox”.  The story is engagingly told by a former advertising man, Terry O’Reilly, in a weekly radio program on our Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) called “Under the Influence”.  The story is told in written form here:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/the-best-selling-cookie-in-the-world-is-a-copycat-brand-1.7080582\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/the-best-selling-cookie-in-the-world-is-a-copycat-brand-1.7080582</a>\n\nBut O’Reilly is such a consummate story-teller on the radio, I would encourage you to listen to him in a podcast of this particular episode from January 11th.
