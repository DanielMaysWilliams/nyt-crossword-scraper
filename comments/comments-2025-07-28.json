However, one of our linguistic staples is the dyktando - the word may look familiar, because it is related to your \"dictating\", as in reading out loud.\n\nDuring a dyktando, a person reads a text full of complex, unusual words and punctuation (where to put a comma is much more complicated in Polish than in English), and participants attempt to write it down.\n\nDyktando is one of the basic components of Polish language classes in primary school, but there are also advanced dyktanda (that's the plural of dyktando) for adults, prepared by best Polish linguists, like Jerzy Bralczyk. They are so fiendishly difficult I would never be able to complete one without errors, even though my Polish is basically perfect. The thing is, an adult dyktando is a bit like a Saturday puzzle at the NYT: tricky on purpose, and dipping heavily into the repository of the language's most obscure words.","createDate":"1753677684","updateDate":"1753729902","approveDate":"1753677685","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143845706,"parentUserDisplayName":"Marcia Fidler","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143847186","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7212188243865967}

The thing is, english lacks some of the grammar and syntax constructs that necessitate the use of a comma in Polish, so I can talk about this stuff in Polish only.\n\nAlso, another major feaure of Polish is whether to write down negation, such as \"nie\" (\"no\") as a separate word or as part of another. For example, \"unwittingly\" in Polish is \"niechcƒÖcy\" (nie, no + chcƒÖcy, willing). However, if I try to convey the same thing not with an adverb with with a verb-based phrase, it looks different: \"nie chcƒÖc\" (not willing).\n\nAs to your question if dyktanda are televised - I have no idea.
