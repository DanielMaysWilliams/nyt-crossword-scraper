It was just one of those puzzles that I had to tug, prod, and poke at until the answers start to emerge from the clues. Especially the NW and SW. Very nice, David.\n\nDeb's question and our constructor's quest for 13 sent me on a post-solve read of literary criticism of Wallace Stevens's poem, which I pulled from JStor. My conclusion is similar to Puzzlemucker's -- I think David is using Wallace's blackbird as a metaphor for this particular puzzle grid. Yes, it's exactly the same grid but what we get from each installment depends on the fill and the cluing. It's quintessentially impressionistic.\n\nI'll share an exposition of the third stanza that I especially liked from my readings. This comes from Price Caldwell of Mississippi State University, \"Metaphoric Structures in Wallace Stevens' 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,'\" published in The Journal of English and Germanic Philology (1972):\n\nThere are at least three movements in the stanza. First, the wind, invisible to the eye, is made visible to the imagination by the whirling blackbird. Second, the chaotic motion of the blackbird in the wind is structured as the formal, abstracted motion of pantomime is juxtaposed to it. Third, pantomime as a mental construction is realized as, in effect, the bird becomes its actor and the winds its stage. As in stanza I the lines create both thing-as-idea and idea-as thing.","createDate":"1704429841","updateDate":"1704646924","approveDate":"1704429844","recommendations":24,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130242172","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.49629274010658264}

Where is the junk?  Where is the junk in this ultra-low-word-count (66) puzzle?  Where is the junk despite that slab of white in the center?  Remarkable!\n\nI don’t know if it’s coincidence or design – and time will tell – but there are a couple of threads woven into David’s three puzzles.  One is marijuana, with today’s REEFER, puzzle #1’s SPLIFF, and #2’s SMOKE POT.  The second is quaint reactions, with today’s I’LL BE DARNED, #1’s GOLLY, and #2’s GOSH.\n\nI do know that with just three puzzles in, David has established himself, IMO, as a Crosslandia force, with a strong and capable voice, and I’m eager to see what’s next.\n\nThis, for me, was an outing rife with thorniness, humor, and beauty, a sumptuous trifecta that fills me with gratitude.

I’ll start with today’s, and if you didn’t do yesterday’s and don’t want spoilers, you can stop reading at the break. \n\nThere are some of us who have gotten pretty good at crosswords, and can solve most Friday and Saturday puzzles in less than 15 min. We welcome gladly the opportunity to solve a tougher one from time to time, even if it will pull our average down a bit. Today’s took me a shade over 20, and although it may seem wondrous to some of you, it was quite slow for a Friday. \n\nBut as an experienced solver, I can tell you that the puzzle was eminently fair. If you don’t know who Alan THICKE was, or why the MARE clue falls within accepted\ncluing conventions, that’s on you. You’re not expected to always know everything, and improvement and understanding come with experience, but it’s not the constructor’s fault that you couldn’t finish the puzzle. And don’t insinuate that he was being malicious because the puzzle was too hard for you. If you stick with it, one day you’ll be thrilled to get a puzzle that requires you to put things in and take them out. \n\nYesterday’s puzzle comments to follow.","createDate":"1704478550","updateDate":"1704716335","approveDate":"1704478552","recommendations":27,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130256211","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.747937798500061}

It was squarely the fault of the IT people at the NYT. There are test solvers, but it’s not their job to test every combination of apps and devices, so they’re not to blame, either. Apple is not to blame, because their software can handle underlined letters. \n\nThe tech people at the NYT should have discovered the problem before the puzzle went live. If they couldn’t figure out the right code to get the underlines to work, they could have informed the Games Dept. of that, and the fix they eventually hit on could have been rolled out before 10:00 pm. \n\nAnd the complaint should be that the IT people should figure out where these issues exist before the puzzle drops. Not that creative and innovative puzzles like this one shouldn’t be accepted. \n\nFor future reference, after a fix is applied, you can go to the puzzle in the Archive calendar,  long press on it, and the updated puzzle will install.","createDate":"1704479122","updateDate":"1704629741","approveDate":"1704479125","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130256211,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130256473","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.688503623008728}

I think that’s it, and it’s more than enough for me, though Henry su and John Ezra found some great possible connections to Stevens’ poem in David’s November puzzle.  If nothing else, I love the opportunity to re-read Stevens’ poem with each of David’s  puzzles.  Each reading is, in fact, different and takes me deeper into the poem.   In that sense, his project also involves 13 ways of looking at Stevens’s “13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird” poem — at least for those of us who read the poem again each time the next of David’s puzzles appears.  I have to say, I find this incredibly stimulating.  It reminds me of taking my first Modern Poetry class in college, when I felt such intellectual and emotional excitement about poetry.  So, thank you for that David.
