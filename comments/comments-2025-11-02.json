Saturday's was great. Usually Sunday themes make the puzzle pretty easy to solve; for me, they tend to take longer than Saturdays due to the size, not the difficulty. However, I blew through this one, 13 minutes faster than my Sunday average. Having the fewest entries in a Sunday puzzle should have made it challenging, but it didn't. I think it's the clueing. They're fairly straightforward, like a typical Sunday, except the straightforward clues for themed Sundays are supposed to help you deduce the theme. Obviously, that's not necessary here. When I finished this puzzle, I didn't have the feeling of accomplishment I get from a Saturday, nor did I get to appreciate a clever Sunday theme.

I thought the face was supposed to be a pumpkin, and I took one look at the grid and knew it was a themeless (come on, you can’t make a themeless with this few words, or if you do you’re even a bigger genius than I can imagine.) So I wasn’t disappointed trying to find one.\nI thought this was Friday level for me, or what I might imagine a Thursday themeless to be. It’s not that I didn’t know must of the clues, but it just seemed like I guessed wrong or was misdirected on many of them, or they were on the tip of my tongue and I just couldn’t get there. I had to jump around all over the place. This was exemplified by “Eccentric”—DOTTY? NUTTY? Oh, BATTY. Seems like that was my experience the whole time. Yes, you are right Barry there weren’t a lot of clever punny clues, but they were clever in other ways that they weren’t obvious to me and I had to stretch. I had the same Naticks as everyone but it seemed like at least one of the names was guessable.\nSo I was impressed even if others weren’t and I had a good time for a Sunday themeless. Oh, thanks for the shout out to RICHARD Feynman—I know there are a lot of RICHARD options, but the man was a genius both as a physicist and a teacher, and if you don’t know him please take the opportunity to learn about him.","createDate":"1762047713","updateDate":"1762116269","approveDate":"1762047715","recommendations":35,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146354735","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6632944345474243}

Having been avid Springsteen fans for decades, we were looking forward to it. We first saw Springsteen live in July, 1978, at the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium (which seated just over 1,7O0 people). It was a fantastic show. \n\nMy Facebook friend Edward Douglas is a film critic. Edward recently posted his review and said this movie was the best thing he had seen this year. That raised my hopes after some other things I’d read that were less positive.\nThe opening scene is Springsteen winding up a concert in 1981. I got a little misty-eyed at how well the filmmakers captured the excitement of one of Springsteen’s shows. The man has a fantastic stage presence. \n\nWe didn’t realize until later that Jeremy Allen White did his own singing (and guitar playing), though while watching it, we thought he'd nailed Springsteen’s speaking voice. We’d only seen him on “Shameless,” in which he plays a kid from a low-income family who gets into college.

The clues were totally not on my wavelength. Many of the guesses I had made turned out to be wrong. And even though the grid was not heavy on trivia, I knew almost nothing of what little there was of it.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nI completed the puzzle without lookups, and quickly, too - the solve took me a tad under 40 minutes, which is quite fast for a Sunday that feels hard.\n\nI almost broke down in the lower left (SW) corner - the only area with an accumulation of trivia entries, which also crossed. Even the non-trivia entry of PSA was clued \"trivially\" - why do constructors/editors do that? If a closed-off section of the puzzle already suffers from an overabundance of proper names, brands, etc., why not clue the other stuff there so that it does not require knowing trivia?\n\nAnyway, I knew Smokey the Bear so I handled it. But it was close. As I was looking at that SW triangle of death, my finger hovered over the onscreen button that initiates an AI search of whatever it is that I mark. \n\nIn the end I completed the puzzle without outside help. But did I enjoy the solve? Nah. I had to work too hard for this win to enjoy it. A regular-sized grid of this difficulty would have been fine. But. Sunday one... I found it too tiring.\n\nBut hey!

Since then, it's mostly polyester. Tough and not very dangerous/flammable. In one little neighborhood repertory theater where i worked in the '80s, we were still using carbon arc lamps, which used to be standard in cinemas until the '60s. This arcane technology involved two pencil-like rods of carbon pointed at one another and kept by a motor in (theoretically) ideal proximity to maintain an actual flame between them, the light from which shone the film image onto the screen a hundred feet or so away. The motor of course did not work ideally, so the rods were prone to fusing (getting too close and hot, so film frames burned) or separating (getting too far apart, picture goes dark) if the projectionist wasn't constantly paying attention and jiggering the spacing with a little knob. From the '50s back, film projection (and spectating) was a death-defying act!","createDate":"1762066143","updateDate":"1762125212","approveDate":"1762066146","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146355757","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8624901175498962}

They do get easy.  You've only been doing these for a year.

That realization is game-changing.\n\nNote that constructors generally put their tricky answers or unguessable names with gentle crosses.  That's why \"Natick\" became a phrase:  in that puzzle, NATICK crossed NC WYETH was uninferable, which was  exceedingly rare.  Today's REEM/ROSAMUND crossing approaches that, but if you can get PSU (Penn State University), ROSAMUND is inferable (as opposed to ROSALIND) as the only likely name.  \n\nUnderstanding that the constructor is not going to cross a not-universally-known name like REEM with an uniferable name, let's say \"Rosavend\" or \"Rosayind,\" helps you get through. \n\nDo these puzzles another year, and I guarantee you will be at a higher level, and perhaps able to manage Saturday puzzles.","createDate":"1762095836","updateDate":"1762117714","approveDate":"1762095836","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146356000,"parentUserDisplayName":"KFC","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146360483","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5328664183616638}

Maybe the character had just read too many women’s magazines. [A friend who read my post on Facebook knows someone who knows all the principal characters; she said that her friend thinks that Landau’s dialog is “mostly accurate.”]\n\nThere are a few characters who aren’t well-introduced, including Springsteen’s childhood friend and a record executive named Al Teller. You’re left wondering who these people are.\n\nI don’t think the film communicated Springsteen’s depression in a way that I could really empathize with, though I'm not sure what the filmmakers could have done differently in that regard.\n\nMy initial reaction was that this wasn’t as good as the Bob Dylan movie (“A Complete Unknown”).

This is, in fact, my favorite part of your haiku. \n\nAfter I saw your post this morning, I pulled up the original lines of C. 85 and took the time to think about them in English, rather than in Latin—mediating lexically rather than conceptually. (Of course this made my wont literality of delving into the structure of the language reduce the poeticality of the poem…) Here goes. \n\nI see ‘odi’ here as ‘I find [you/her/him] odious,’ not as I ‘hate.’ See, ‘odi’ is one of Latin’s defective perfects, meaning it has no present form. It literally means ‘I have hated’ (perfect), but functions as a present in meaning. So, grammatically and semantically, it’s baked in as a state resulting from past emotion—not the flaring, active passion of anger implied in the English ‘I hate,’ but rather a settled stance, a cool judgment. \n\nCatullus could have gone with something like:\n\nDetestor et amo—I abominate and I love.\nExsecror et amo—I curse and I love. \n\nBut he didn’t. Instead he is repelled, made uneasy. \n\nHe does the same with ‘fieri sentio.’ He doesn’t say, ‘I feel it,’ but ‘I feel it coming into being.’ ‘Fieri’ is a very passive-reflective construction, almost Stoic in flavor—as if he’s observing the externality of the process of these emotions happening to him. \n\n  — I’ll continue below","createDate":"1762094781","updateDate":"1762141400","approveDate":"1762094782","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146355649,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ken Burk","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146359887","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.63130122423172}

And I see the elegance of your semantically tying it in with ‘excrucior.’\n\nBut—and this is a big one. Catullus doesn’t say ‘crucifigor’—‘I’m being nailed to the cross,’ implying the piercing feeling in your haiku—but ‘crucior’—‘I am suffering the pain as if on the cross/rack/torture device’ (the ‘ex-‘ intensifies it). In my English rendering, the second line reads as, ‘I do not know, but I feel this coming about, and I bear the cross [of this feeling]. \n\nRemember that Catullus is writing in the 1st c. BCE. Being put up on the cross is a form of torture, but not the killing-the-Son-of-God, never-to-be-forgiven-and-rendered-in-art-and-the-written-word-with-varying-degrees-of-convincing-pathos-for-millennia-to-come kind of torture. Hence the usual translation of ‘I feel it happening and it torments me’ translations. I like preserving the ‘crux’ or ‘cross’ in my translation today, hence my rendering it it today as ‘I bear the cross.’ \n\nOK, my husband is having kittens because we’re supposed to be leaving for a dinner in 10 minutes. \n\nHappy Sunday.","createDate":"1762095361","updateDate":"1762141460","approveDate":"1762095363","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146359887,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ken Burk","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146360206","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6510612368583679}

Each of our reclamation projects had moments through the year in which they saved the day or astonished us. \nAnd so many of them played on, even when injured, even when it was against their long-term economic interests because they loved their teammates, they loved the fans,they loved 'their' country. They /cried/ last night, knowing how unlikely it was that they would have the career years that they had all so fortuitously happened to have simultaneously this year.\nWell, enough. That's baseball.
