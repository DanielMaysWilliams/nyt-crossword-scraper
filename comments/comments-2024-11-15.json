What’s obscure to one person isn’t necessarily that to another.

For me, it detracts from the solving experience because it is completely random. I have no problem with popular slang, even if I don’t use it.” — Steve Immelt\n\nFrom Christina:\n\n[see my previous comment]\n\nA small European town with the population of 2,000 is probably a “who cares,” unless there’s a significant historical event that took place there. The name of an author who won a Pulitzer could be in a puzzle, even if the editors weren’t familiar with it. Similarly, an actor who has been a minor character in five movies doesn’t feel especially important, but someone like AYO EDEBIRI, who had a major breakout role in “The Bear,” feels worth including in a grid. When we allow names that seem on the difficult side, we generally try to make the crossing entries fair.\n\nWhy do we allow proper names at all? If we limited grids to just words, there are far fewer possible entries to use, and grids would start to feel the same. Allowing constructors to highlight people or places makes puzzles feel more colorful and full of character. They can put references in the grid that reflect their tastes and people or places they care about.","createDate":"1731707681","updateDate":"1731757149","approveDate":"1731707685","recommendations":23,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137647000","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6761988401412964}

Some of the younger solvers may not realize that Casablanca came out while WWII was still blazing, the fall of 1942. Some of the actors in that scene were French refugees, including the tearful 20 year old woman (Yvonne Lebeau) who shouts “Vive La France! Vive La democratie!” at the end.\n\n“As it turns out, Lebeau herself had fled Nazi-engulfed Europe with her Jewish husband, Marcel Dalio, who plays Emil the croupier at Rick’s Café and who was already famous in Europe for his winning performances in Jean Renoir’s La Grande Illusion (Grand Illusion, 1937) and La Règle du jeu (Rules of the Game, 1939). In an ugly turn, close-ups of Dalio, taken from those films, were appropriated on anti-Semitic Vichy propaganda placards. Shortly before the German invasion of Paris, Dalio and Lebeau made their way to Lisbon, that prized destination for languishing refugees in Casablanca, and from there, using forged visas, secured passage on the S.S. Quanza, a Portuguese ship carrying hundreds of émigrés to the New World. Landing in Mexico, they were able to get temporary Canadian visas and, with them in hand, crossed the border to California and eventually to the back lot at Warner Bros.”\n<a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/winter/feature/in-casablanca-madeleine-lebeau-became-forever-the-face-french-resistance\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/winter/feature/in-casablanca-madeleine-lebeau-became-forever-the-face-french-resistance</a>\n\nThanks to the National Endowment for the Humanities for the nice background.

The Identity matrix (matrix analog of the scalar “1”) and null matrix (matrix analog of “0”) are just special cases of a whole universe of idempotent NxM matrices.  The algebraic properties of these special matrices allow us to construct many important tests (one small example: “hmmm.  Out of the thousands of data entries that my forecast derives from, this small subset seems to be having a large impact on my projection. (If I have any analytical integrity) I’d better double-check this subset to make sure my forecast, or estimated functional relation, isn’t being driven by a few erroneous data entries,”)\n\nSo, yeah, the word itself is pretty idiosyncratic if you haven’t studied matrix algebra and/or  (e.g.) its application to statistical regression.

Glad you liked it. I think many of us have been dissatisfied with the ability of the new editing team to keep up with crosswords that are solvable without extensive knowledge of trivia. \n\nThis one just seemed to be even more notable than others. A 3-column cross of French and proper nouns isn't a hard puzzle, it's just a binary of you know it or you don't, and many of us prefer the puzzle solve more than googling names.\n\nHow about this: at what percent of proper noun answers is the puzzle no longer enjoyable for you? Over 10%? What about 20+%, as today? 40%? Is there a number where the trivia makes the puzzle an impossible solve for even many experienced puzzlers without Google?
