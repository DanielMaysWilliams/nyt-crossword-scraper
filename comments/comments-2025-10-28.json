Yet, I must admit that for the most part it's simply personal prejudice combined with a certain snobbishness.  If language did not change, the English I love would never have come to be.  The drivers of such change are not for mere mortals to determine, but it stands to reason they would not be language conservatives like myself.  So, although the disappearance of the true meaning of \"enormity\" and the consternating substitution of \"loose\" for lose - among too many other changes to name - will continue to get my goat, I don't expect the English language will be asking my persmission to evolve.

For me it's not phrases though but sights. As kids my friends and I spent a lot of time outside, in the undeveloped no-man's-land between the apartment buildings of Warsaw's government-built Ursynów district. It had been designed as a beautiful and liveable garden city in the boom decade of the 1970s, but the economic crisis of the 1980s meant only the blocks of flats were constructed. The untended land all around, dotted with heaps of earth and mounds of concrete rubble left over from construction work was our playground. We loved it.\n\nThese days every time I see clumps of weeds it takes me back to my childhood. The pangs of nostalgia are almost too hard to take. Everything was so much simpler and joyous... Our forts were made of twigs, rubbish and construction detritus, but I had some of the best fun of my life in them.\n\nBtw. Nowadays Ursynów is one of Warsaw's greenest districts, among the best places to live in the city. The prosperity brought about by democracy and market economy finally allowed the realization of the original vision of its designers. Marek Budzyński, Ursynów's chief urbanist and architect - now in his late 80s - lives here. My wife and I bought a condo in Ursynów, too, and we love it. Everything is very different than it was, but the ghosts of my childhood are everywhere.","createDate":"1761632211","updateDate":"1761731641","approveDate":"1761632213","recommendations":27,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146243411,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146243715","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5241253972053528}

And how lovely that the Ursynów architect has seen his vision finally come to fruition—and to live in it, no less. \n\nMy husband talks about selling up in Washington when my contract here is up and going back home to Utah. For me it threatens to be too bittersweet, though: The adage about never being able to step into the same river twice comes to mind. I’ve even thought on occasion about, gasp! staying here longer. We’ve made some amazing friends here, the kind you don’t think you’ll make in your 40s. While I’m still acutely homesick every day for the smell of my sunbaked, cracked desert soil and purple sage, the depth of human relationships out here has surprised and delighted me.","createDate":"1761637460","updateDate":"1761740164","approveDate":"1761637461","recommendations":17,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146243715,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146244135","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9007554650306702}

Europe is so different from the US though I think I can imagine how weird it must feel to you.

There was an undercurrent of European heritage about most of the culture, but all the details - and much of the major stuff, too - was completely alien. The threateningly unfriendly police, the guns, the ever-present religion, the oversized cars, the rudimentary public infrastructure and services, the smilingly subservient staff at business establishments, the gargantuan portion sizes, the synthetic ingredients of the preternaturally moist and pale gas station sandwiches - it would all be too much for me to take in the long run.\n\nThat being said, my wife and I found the landscapes of the US, and of Utah in particular, incredibly beautiful. The grandness of the vistas, the striking colors - wow, just wow. The fake smiles of most servers and shopping assistants notwithstanding, we met countless friendly, wonderful people there, too.

I had one interaction with police in the US - for a minor thing that wasn't even illegal I was threatened with jail and encouraged to leave the state of Nevada. I have never experienced anything remotely as disturbing in any European country. The owner of a hotel in Northern California waved his huge gun before us to show us how safe his business was. I felt like leaving. We were asked about our religion at breakfast at a BnB by the other guests and we got strange looks when we declared our atheism, and a religious service was an integral part of a village fair in California. The Jeep we drove was described as mid sized by the rental company, yet it wouldn't fit in an average European parking space. The staff at most restaurants prostrated themselves before us - by a European standard, anyway - presumably working for their tips (which we always gave, even if the servers didn't sacrifice their human dignity for them).

To make things worse, Tuesdays aren't supposed to have such obscure (to most) crossings.\n\nI got it because ESME was the most likely name, and HAM was a word.  The crossing letter could have been T, since ESTE is a possible name (but is usually clued to Spanish), and HAT is also a word; if you don't know the right one, GO HAM and GO HAT make equal sense (or don't).\n\nBut I can easily see that it was a brutal cross, and my choice was definitely a guess...an experienced guess, no doubt, but still a guess.","createDate":"1761656145","updateDate":"1761672088","approveDate":"1761656146","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146243648,"parentUserDisplayName":"Yer","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146247458","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5616235136985779}
