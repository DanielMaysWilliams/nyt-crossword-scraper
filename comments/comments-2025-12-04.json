The theme was clever, and if I had some disappointment about it, it would be that that the choices for the theme elements seemed a little meh to me. I liked CARBONDATE and TOOKNOTICE; I’m a little leery of CARAMELDELITES, since that would only be spelled that way for the Girl Scout Cookie, which is a little niche, but given that MELD is a tricky connector I would let that slide; but NINETIESKID seems very green painty (I’ve never heard of that per se—is it any more special than an EIGHTIESKID or a SEVENTIESKID?) and CREEPINGOUT seems pretty meh. I haven’t tried too hard to look for better ones but it seems like you could have found better choices for PIN and TIE, and I don’t like that NINE has the same root as NINETIES. Also for a Thursday I would have liked the ends to be clued more wittily (Auto and Consumed? Also and Frozen Water? That’s the best you could come up with?)\nMy favorite parts were actually the NE corner, and then the SW, which had some nice ministacks, some more interesting clueing (I loved the PLAYDOH one) and a misdirect (USSR before CCCP).\n\nI hate to come off too negative because it was a clever idea, probably harder than it looks, and not a bad solve; just felt it had some more unrealized potential.

Oddly, my first thought for the letters on Drago's tracksuit was indeed CCCP.  Don't know why, since I never saw any Rocky movie after the first one. But because I solve on paper, I don't fill it in unless I'm sure. When PLAYDOH finally popped into my brain, I could actually still smell it after all these decades.\n\nBut the rest of the puzzle was a yawner. Even though I managed to get all four unexciting theme answers, I had no idea what CARAMELDELITE was, other than being annoyed by the spelling. Having now learned they're also Samoas doesn't help much, because I stopped buying Girl Scout Cookies even before my daughter was old enough to join, which she never did. And NINETIESKID???? What's so special about that term that makes it a heavy-hitting Thursday themer? Any different from Eighties Kid? Or Sixties Kid? \n\nOverall, this ranks with one of my all time least favorite Thursday puzzles, all the more disappointing because I usually associate Jeff Chen's name with positive puzzling.","createDate":"1764852544","updateDate":"1764872120","approveDate":"1764852546","recommendations":1,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147053293","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5352212190628052}

But then I get a stretch of a month when I don't get it at all.\n\nSome of it, I think, is the selection of acceptable words, but some of it is that I have busier and less busy times.

I especially cringe when I see “this was the best puzzle ever!” and nothing else; I don’t dismiss the poster’s right to an opinion but I’d sure love to know what they saw in it and what experience they have to satisfy my own curiosity.\nI’ve also seen people respond to D in a surprisingly condescending way when it’s obvious they are a smart  person and it’s not a question of misunderstanding. We saw this yesterday; I didn’t care for the tone of their comment either, but the response of basically “what, was it too hard for you” was uncalled for and not D’s point.\nI agree “lazy” is always triggering for me; I don’t mind “too clever by half”, though, because that just means the constructor sacrificed a good solving experience for a clever theme; I usually still appreciate those puzzles but certainly respect those who don’t.\nBasically my overall point is many of us are very quick to dismiss the negative posters when they often have legitimate points to make and we can learn from them. I will happily raise my hand and say I think Andrzej and D have made me a better constructor and I think about what their criticisms may be when I am creating a puzzle.

I know for a while their submission site has said they are particularly looking for Thursdays and Sundays WITHOUT rebuses, but that may just be the volume they get of them, not necessarily the trickiness. My last published puzzle was a double rebus and at that time they admitted they were trying to tone down on those as well unless they were particularly apt—they took it anyway and I’ve certainly seen a bunch more since then. I just had a rejection that had elements pushing out of the grid and they suggested they were trying to do that less frequently as well (although maybe it was just a polite excuse for rejection). I haven’t seen any official pronouncements otherwise.

I got it pretty quickly, got TOOKNOTICE on crosses, then saw KNOT in the middle and it was obvious that there would be a connecting term connecting the two words. It’s not ESP and it’s not suck it up, I would certainly prefer an extra theme entry rather than a revealer which didn’t need to be there. I personally would have preferred no shading which would have made it more fun for me, as well as more cryptically clued words on the ends, but I think those days of more challenging Thursdays may be gone with the wind, and would certainly have engendered even more complaints on this forum (“how can anyone have solved this thing”), and even if the constructors had planned it that way or preferred it would probably have been nixed by the editors who I really do think are trying to make crosswords more accessible, for better or for worse.","createDate":"1764883020","updateDate":"1764925327","approveDate":"1764883021","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147070932,"parentUserDisplayName":"MaryEllen","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147071528","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6164193153381348}
