Sorry about my strange comment about there being so few comments.  I usually do the puzzle after dinner while my husband does the dishes.  (I cook, he cleans.)  Last night we had late dinner and when I sat down to do the puzzle I did the newest one, not noticing that it was already the Wed puzzle.  After 7 pm PST.  I finished it, went to read column and comments as always, and was so surprised at only 75 comments.\n\nBefore going to bed -- now 11 pm PST -- I realized I hadn't finished the other puzzles, so went to do them.  That's when I noticed I'd done Wed, but never Tuesday!  I assumed my streak was blown.  But I did Tuesday before midnight, so it was still Tues, and the Stats page kept my streak!\n\nI knew that if I missed a day and did it before I did the next day's that the streak would remain.  But I didn't know I could do them out of order if the earlier one finished on its correct day.\n\nI've done 2800  puzzles, but streak is only 45 days, so not a big deal to lose it.  Longest is 625 days, but usually every couple of months I miss a day or two and start the streak over.  Not a big deal to me.  \n\nBut now it's Wed and the puzzle is already finished -- so I'm writing this long harrangue on the Thursday comments.  Again, it's after 10 pm in New York....","createDate":"1763003644","updateDate":"1763093735","approveDate":"1763003645","recommendations":22,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146610668","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7776690721511841}

I’ve come a ways, racking up over 3000 NYT puzzles (I play extensively in the archives), and feel confident solving every day of the week. I’ve branched out into cryptics (love wordplay), other crosswords (NYT will always be my first love), and logic puzzles. I’m so grateful to the entire NYT Games team, all the constructors, and the games community for creating this wonderful puzzle which sustains and enriches so many of us. Thank you, Deb, and best of luck on your next adventures! \n\nI’m beyond excited for Puzzle Mania (preordered my copy and also treated myself to Joel Fagliano’s Puzzle Mania book too!) I’m celebrating Shortzmas. Cool jazz, hot tea, holiday sweets, and Will Shortz puzzles.","createDate":"1763006062","updateDate":"1763102914","approveDate":"1763006063","recommendations":55,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146611296","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9676263332366943}

But I will give some constructive criticism. This wasn’t a bad puzzle at all and shows promise, but if you didn’t know this was a new constructor you might guess it. A lot of really questionable fill that a more seasoned constructor might have worked around—KUDO, LDRS, OHCMON, DCUP—and three letter glue like PEE and UHS and AHH. Some questionable clues that may or may not be the constructor’s fault—“make it”? Like “make a TAG” in baseball? MARS as something in the Milky Way? Um, so is my dog’s left ear and on a relative scale of things that happen to be in the galaxy, not much different. \nOn the plus side, a clever theme idea, but a bit of a letdown after a stellar early week—would have been better switched with yesterday’s where it would have been a fine Wednesday theme. Also suited more for a Wednesday as a challenge, the top was quite easy, the bottom a bit harder.\nI did have to flyspeck at the end (I see I wasn’t the only one)—I had TEAS right (nice misdirect!) and BADRAP right  (could’ve been BADREP) but had SHOOTSH(OMEH)OOPS which AI, when I asked it, encouraged me was a thing (it’s not)—not your fault it had to be UHS not UHH, but I had to read the column to be set straight.\nSo, congrats on your debut—this was quite an amusing theme despite all my nitpicking, and I look forward to more from you in the future!","createDate":"1763007813","updateDate":"1763056734","approveDate":"1763007813","recommendations":4,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146611716","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5795587301254272}

It ages well and is a completely everyday object here. Occasionally, a special edition is minted. For the Vancouver Olympics, the loon was shown wings lifted amid splashing water, with the Olympic rings above.\nThe $2 coin, inevitably called the toonie, shows a polar bear against a rocky background. Its format consists of a silver rim surrounding a gold-coloured central insert. It had a rough start; in the earliest coins, the inserts sometimes popped out of the frames! It too has had some special editions, including one in which the polar bear is shown with two cubs.\nBoth are solid, easy to handle, visually and tactilely distinctive,  and lovely to look at.","createDate":"1763071849","updateDate":"1763074454","approveDate":"1763071850","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146623509,"parentUserDisplayName":"Michael Weiland","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146631530","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8369907736778259}
