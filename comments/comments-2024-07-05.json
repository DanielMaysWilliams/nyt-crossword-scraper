Couldn't find it...had to think the old-fashioned way: using my brain. \n\nSecond pass through, I started to fill in answers, with a chuckle here (AD NAUSEAM) and an answer there (REN FAIRE) and I was on my way. Not a bad time for me, for a Friday, and a great way to start my day. (I didn't do well on Connections, but did great on Strands, so I needed this win to boost my ego.)\n\nNow off to my shift at the ER to see who will come in with an owie from yesterday's festivities.

Thinking back on the book, I don't think I want to re-read it anytime soon. Reality is more than enough for me at the moment. \n\nThought this was a terrific puzzle today! A few tricky spots for me, but I found the crossings gentle when I didn't know something. (Looking at you, SISAL!)  I did not get immediate happy music though... like many of u, I'd put a u in NAUSEAM and moved on. Would have been a Friday best otherwise but I should have known better there. SRSLY! Happy to have had no lookups or helps again!  \n\nMy favorite was \"Green juice\" for SOLAR POWER. \n\n\"Tom sporting a striped coat, say\" made me think of yesterday when I wanted to put Tom for, \"Peeper that doesn't make a sound,\" before I figured out EYE. \n\nDeb's column, always great, was extra terrific today! I appreciate the explanation of a themeless—and especially of soup dumplings! I've always been a bit curious but have so far stuck to the safer sounding regular dumplings... and then forget to look up what the deal is with soup dumplings. I'm going to get them next time!\n\nLastly, I add my voice to the praise for the constructor's notes. They were the brandy soaked Bing cherries on top! If anyone knows Gallup's \"Strength Finder,\" one of my strengths is interconnectedness, so this was totally my ASPIC, err, jam! \n\nBeautifully written!
