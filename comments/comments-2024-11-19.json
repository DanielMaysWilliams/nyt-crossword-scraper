I think he's a genius, or at least supervocabularic. Maybe it's his glasses and freaky hair, or maybe it's because his puzzles are so fun and he imparts wisdom so warmly, like in his notes that hope is a discipline. Words to live by, or, as in some people's cases, to live by words. \n\nI don't know if it's a pattern, but loved the plethora of people of color in this grid: Griner, Vivica, MLK, Shacarri, Shah, Carlos, Simone, Octavia, and Yoda (Cmon, he's BEIGE!). Also liked seeing HE/HIM along with a possible portmanteau of someone who's both: SHIM. \n\n[Like content that causes secondhand embarrassment] seems to call for an adjective, CRINGY (in itself, a cringy word) -- is CRINGE now an adjective? \n\nAlso good to see HOAGIE here. One of those words for such a sandwich that helps identify where you're from (subs, grinders...). I'm from hoagie country. \n\nAnd yeah, too bad on the Idaho/ID clue coming on the heels of an even better one a couple days ago.

Thankfully, she passed peacefully and with a minimum of suffering at the last. After making some phone calls that I needed to make to take care of arrangements for taking care of her body, and notifying other close family members I tried to get some sleep, but sleep would not come.  So I opened the NY T Sunday puzzle and worked it.  It was both therapeutic and poignant, as it was my mother who inspired in me my love of words, and,more particularly, my love of crosswords and other word puzzles.  From a very early age I can remember the pleasure she took from sitting down on Sundays after church and solving the NYT Sunday puzzle.  When I got older, I would sometimes help her with the puzzle, and when I got older still, we sometimes fought over who would have dibs on the first crack at the puzzle.  She remained a puzzler right up to the end, although she never graduated to solving on line.  So for me, sitting in my darkened bedroom, doing the Sunday puzzle was a comfort beyond words.","createDate":"1732030651","updateDate":"1732093653","approveDate":"1732030655","recommendations":100,"replyCount":19,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137723389","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.45023250579833984}

(My suggestion to them: don't spend all day writing in an online forum about $300 pens and how to be more productive.) I did find useful information there, once I waded through all the obsession about productivity and pens (among other things) but I don't visit there very often these days.\n\nConstructing a TIME BUDGET is a huge part of the entire GTD mindset.
