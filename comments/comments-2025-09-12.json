A measurement was given in decibels and it was also said that those standing proximate to the band when they were in full swing and Pete was whomping his guitar to death would probably suffer from some degree of permanent deafness. Even as a youngster, I found this claim to be a dubious one, as well as that The Who was indeed the world's loudest, and my doubts have only grown with age. But it's true that I have seen them live several times, and it's also true that I am growing deaf. The two might be related.\n\nBack to the puzzle. Case load - hah, good one!
