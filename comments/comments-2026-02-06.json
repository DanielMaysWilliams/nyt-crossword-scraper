I’ll try to have a thicker skin, but I do hope we can not only be more thoughtful and respectful ourselves but speak up when we see inappropriate comments since the Times really can’t moderate everything—and recognize that everyone may have different limits about what is tolerable. Enough said.\nAnyways I could hardly stay away from a puzzle that references Reds fandom, even tangentially. I figured it had to do with wine but couldn’t pull the term out—in fact that corner almost stumped me until JICAMA crept out of the crevices of my brain.\nI loved this. It started a lot harder than it ended up for me, but a lot of sparkling entries and clueing. I especially liked a lot of the creative clues for some short answers —OWL, BIB, APB, TAN. Loved PLOPART, will definitely add that to my active vocabulary. I can certainly confirm the difficulty of 14 letter entries, this was an elegant grid under the circumstances, surprised they didn’t cave and just use a 14 x 16 (how do I know? Just submitted one myself, we will see if it flies).\nMy only regret for the puzzle is the lack of a cleverer clue for ITSASMALLWORLD. Not that it’s a gimme—SPLASHMOUNTAIN has the same number of letters, ask me how I know—but get any piece of it and the rest is obvious, would have loved to have been stumped longer on such a fun entry.

But why has the spork never caught on, outside of the Great Outdoors? Eminently practical, especially when served apple pie, or birthday cake, a la mode.\n\nBut here's my linguistic discovery of the day: \"Spork\" was originally a proprietary trademark--this I knew, although I'm not sure who held, or holds the trademark. But \"Spork\" was already an entry in the 1909 edition of the Century Dictionary, where it was described as \"a 'portmanteau-word'\". Wait! The term \"portmanteau-word\" was coined by Lewis Carroll, in *Though the Looking-glass*, which was published in 1871.  By 1909, was the term common enough to be used as a descriptor in a dictionary entry?\n\nFinally, @Andrzej, I'm now reading Natalie Haynes' book of essays on (monstrous) women in Greek mythology, so a picture of a cute little echidna was happy coincidence!","createDate":"1770384415","updateDate":"1770414135","approveDate":"1770384416","recommendations":14,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148685483","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8644592761993408}
