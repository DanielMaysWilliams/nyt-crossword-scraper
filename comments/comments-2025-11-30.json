If I said the quote to someone, “Knowledge is power, France is Bacon,” they nodded knowingly. Or someone might say, “Knowledge is power” and I’d finish the quote “France is bacon,” and they wouldn’t look at me like I’d said something very odd, but thoughtfully agree. I did ask a teacher what did “Knowledge is power, France is bacon” mean and got a full 10-minute explanation of the “knowledge is power” bit but nothing on “France is bacon.” When I prompted further explanation by saying “France is bacon?” in a questioning tone, I just got a “yes.” At 12 I didn’t have the confidence to press it further.

And then he took another look and he saw something that made him set his pail down. There, in the center of the web, neatly woven in block letters, was a message.

I knew EATERY but not \"greasy spoon\".\n\nThe Polish equivalent of EATERY is \"jadłodajnia\", literally \"the place where food is served\". \"Jadło\" is an old Polish term for food (derived from \"jeść\", \"to eat\"), no longer used on its own, and \"dawać\" - a verb which shares a root with the noun-ish suffix \"-dajnia\" - means \"to give\". These days \"jadłodajnia\" is almost always used quaintly, virtually exclusively in proper names of old-school-y, no-no sense eateries serving a small selection of Polish staples, like \"pomidorowa\" (tomato soup) or \"kotlet schabowy z kapustą zasmażaną\" (thick loin schnitzel with fried cabbage). When I was a kid in the 80s, it was never a proper name, but always a generic one.\n\nI'm trying to think if we have a concept of \"greasy spoon\". The closes equivalent would probably be \"mordownia\", literally \"place where you can get murdered\", which denotes a dangerously dirty and raucous establishment. However, a typical mordownia would be a seedy bar rather than messy eatery - it's alcohol that makes it dangerous, and not only low hygiene standards 🤣.","createDate":"1764485417","updateDate":"1764557884","approveDate":"1764485418","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146954224,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146954376","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7137725353240967}
