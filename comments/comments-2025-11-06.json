I always say anagram puzzles need a raisin d’etre and I’m not sure this one has one. Sure, you found some languages you can anagram—good for you. (And you lose points for admitting to using a computer program instead of the old fashioned scrabble tiles). They will always be symmetrical since they are anagrams, and there will always be a translation so it’s not like you have to be too clever about it. Points for all the hoops you had to jump through to fit them into the grid (including finding a pair that cross with TONGUETWISTER) and that was an appropriate enough revealer. But it’s not twisty or challenging enough for a Thursday (the anagrams actually make it easier) so maybe if this were a Tuesday or Wednesday I would have appreciated it more.  I did like the SHEESH and YOWZAH placement and TIL that Swift invented the name VANESSA, so thanks for that.

But enough about somebody skating to Coldplay at a recent ISU Grand Prix event.\n\nI'm rarely impressed by the construction of a puzzle, but this came close. Finding words the English translations of which were anagrams of the name of the original language - and then incorporating it all into a mostly enjoyable grid - can't have been easy. Well done.\n\nThat being said, I was slightly put off by the themed non-English words being complete enigmas. Well, mostly, anyway.\n\nThe Croatian \"kabanica\" sounds much like an old-fashioned Polish word for a coat - \"kabat\", which actually helped me solve one of today's anagrams. The etymology of the Polish word is not clear (there are at least two theories), but it being so similar to Croatian can't be pure coincidence, can it?\n\nFor more language trivia: English has the word \"turncoat\". Well, in Polish the verb \"przekabacić\" (literally, turn a coat) means to cause somebody to go turncoat.\n\nKabaty also used to be a village that now is a sub-division of my Warsaw district of Ursynów. The village was probably named after its one-time owners, the Kabat family, who in turn somehow were named for a military coat.\n\nI solved the puzzle in Wednesday time but it did not feel easy, at all. I thought the difficulty was OK for this time in the week.\n\nAnd now for something completely different.

Maybe this is just the battle ground where theatre grads and film grads come to blows, but there’s more to Farce than just silly jokes; it’s a genre in which a whole conceptual escalation leads to ridicule, and Spaceballs is a ridiculous masterpiece but its core comes from, obviously, its distortion of its source material, and not from an original core concept.","createDate":"1762420996","updateDate":"1762460015","approveDate":"1762420997","recommendations":13,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146446499","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7730829119682312}

I really need to stop doing these puzzles at 4 am when everyone east of here is still asleep and I'm not ready for that.\n\nHad to smile at CROATIAN, evoking yet another memory of that first trip to Eastern Europe before the fall of communism. Those days there were no cell phones, no Apple or Google translate, and of course I didn't speak any of the languages. But I had what every traveler desperately needed: a Serbo-Croatian-English dictionary. We sat down to our very first meal in Croatia, lunch at an unassuming little outdoor restaurant. No matter wherever I traveled, I was determined to not get ripped off, so before we ordered, I translated every single item on the menu. I then ordered a \"hamburger s kajmak sirom:, which came with a cheese of that particular region. When the bill came, there was an extra charge for the cheese. I was livid, and actually fought with the waiter, pointing to the menu, then to my dictionary, back and forth, until he had to choice but to remove the extra charge, which couldn't have been more than 15 cents. But it was the principle. I couldn't believe I'd fought and won with nothing more than a dictionary.

Was SHEA Irish?\n\nNope. Shea comes from ‘si’, the word for ‘shea tree’ in Bambara, the most widely spoken of the official languages of Mali. Though Mali, like other parts of West Africa, was under French colonial rule until the 20th c., ‘shea’ comes to us via the travel literature of one Mungo Park, a Scottish explorer, who had managed to get to Mali before the French. The OED attests it first in his book titled ‘Travels in the interior of Africa, in the years 1795, 1796, & 1797:’\n\n“In clearing wood land for cultivation, every tree is cut down but the Shea.”\n\nWhat’s interesting is that English hadn’t pick up the already existing then French word for ‘shea’—‘karité’—before Park went traipsing through what is Mali today. By the time Park got to Mali, the French had been sitting in West Africa for some time (though not in Mali), and in the process they had imported ‘karité’ from Wolof, the language spoken today in Senegal, Gambia, and Mauritania. In Wolof shea is called ‘kaarite,’ which, acc. to Spanish Wikipedia, means ‘pan de mono’ or ‘monkey bread.’\n\n(@Andrzej, this is for you: No relation between Fr. karité and Sp. carite (mackerel) or Med. Lat. karitās (charity) or Anc. Greek χάριτα—khárita (grace). Sometimes a false cognate is just a false cognate is monkey bread [smile]). \n\nWell, I suppose ‘shea’ does roll off the tongue more easily than [gargles in preparation] ‘karité.’","createDate":"1762435355","updateDate":"1762480737","approveDate":"1762435356","recommendations":20,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146449677","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8559024333953857}

It even inspired me to find a couple of cricket games to watch, which was easy when we lived in the DC metro area with lots of people from India and the West Indies. I even organized two game-watching picnics as fundraisers for our church, complete with cress sandwiches, ginger beer and the right church members doing the play-by-play.\n  If anyone plays cricket in Poland, @Andrzej, I'd recommend at least dropping in on a game.\nOne of the coolest cricket rules is that you really often have to quit while you're ahead, because if there isn't enough time for your opponent to get in the required number of tries, you don't win even if you had a huge score. Of course this doesn't apply in various fast- cricket versions (designed to fit into today's hurried world).","createDate":"1762454940","updateDate":"1762486689","approveDate":"1762454940","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146446949,"parentUserDisplayName":"Cyndie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146461932","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8828111886978149}

Her prose manages something extremely rare - it is very simple yet refined. Tokarczuk has a talent for using minimalist means to maximum effect. She abhors big words and overly long sentences. Her Polish is not experimental. And yet she is better than anybody else at conveying whatever it is she wants.

What you describe as enjoyable (or at least what I can interpret from learning what you dislike) is what I find to be meh and apparently vice versa.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I didn’t think today’s puzzle was a triumph, but I do enjoy sticky clues that are hard to parse and require working through the crosses and maybe some starts and stops and restarts to decipher.  \n\nI’m sure I’m simplifying, but it seems you like a puzzle where you can read a clue and just type in the answer.  If you have to take extra steps (e.g. examine the crosses), that is less enjoyable.  For me, that’s a Monday or Tuesday puzzle and those are fun only in that I try to go fast and break my record.\n\nWith late week puzzles, the reward is often the eureka moment when you figure out that RAINCOAT and CROATIA share the same letters and the remaining themed clues are not much more accessible.\n\nIn most cases, the answers are words you know and the clue is just trying to make it hard to recognize.  The clues that give me heart burn or names of authors or languages other than Spanish (Thanks NY State academic requirements!)\n\nAnyway, happy to chat with my puzzle inverse and wish you nothing but puzzle satisfaction going forward.","createDate":"1762437061","updateDate":"1762464262","approveDate":"1762437061","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146450084,"parentUserDisplayName":"D","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146450783","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.497355580329895}
