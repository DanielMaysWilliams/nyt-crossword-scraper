This one made me stop and think. \n\nTo further embellish on Deb's suggestions for solving tough puzzles, some of the \"rules\" I go with on a harder day include:\n\n1. Answer the ones you know first, regardless of where you need to start. \n2. Don't guess until absolutely necessary.\n3. When you do guess, be flexible enough to yank a word that doesn't seem to play well with the crosses.\n\nI thought for sure that 1A had to be TUNA.  Of course, it wasn't.  (Just like 7D wasn't A TAD, and 46D wasn't SHORE.)\n\nIn my opinion, looking up answers is cheating like training wheels is cheating.  Do it if you need to, but try to build up to where you don't as quickly as possible.  It's fine for anyone to solve at whatever level they're at, but it's much more rewarding to get to the point where you're not looking things up.\n\nAnd if it doesn't bother you to look things up, it doesn't really matter what I think.","createDate":"1717727598","updateDate":"1717895625","approveDate":"1717727601","recommendations":44,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133744515","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6014519333839417}

I had to fill in for one of the singers who'd been called away for a couple weeks. One part of the cantata needed a song with strong timpani to accompany it. I was able to get \"Tubular Bells\" (Part 1, I believe) into the mix for that. Had our choir director known it was from the album that spawned the theme for \"The Exorcist\", he'd have nixed it, even though the music was perfect. I file that in my list of small victories in subversion.\n\n2) Not knowing anything about Mike Oldfield besides \"Tubular Bells\" and \"Hergest Ridge\", I went to a music festival in Augsburg, Germany -- I was stationed there -- in 1983. On the bill were Van Morrison, Crosby Stills & Nash, Robert Palmer, John McLaughlin, Blue Oyster Cult (who cancelled last minute dammit!), Peter Tosh, and ... Mike Oldfield. I was intrigued about what he'd do at a festival. \n\nLittle did I know that Oldfield's more recent (at the time) work was a bit more lyrically inspired, and, interestingly to me, the huge crowd of Germans in attendance sang along with all the lyrical songs. I became a huge fan after that great show.\n\nFwiw, Crosby Stills & Nash were good not great and Van Morrison stumbled -- apparently drunk -- onto the stage 10 minutes after his band had started his opening song, \"Moondance\", barely did a couple tunes, and that was that...","createDate":"1717763631","updateDate":"1717798397","approveDate":"1717763634","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133748733,"parentUserDisplayName":"Paul Turner","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133750146","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7238525152206421}
