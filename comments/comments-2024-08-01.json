Somewhere along the line, Rajeswari came across the phrase RIPPED ABS and didn’t just move on; her brain tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Look closer!”  That’s crossword constructor brain.  She’s got it.\n\nAnd she delivered.  A bit into the puzzle, when I had uncovered one of the theme answers and knew it was correct, even though it didn’t fit its clue – well, that is one of Crosslandia’s great moments: where you know there’s a riddle to crack and an aha coming when you do.  It brings a bounce to your brain’s step.  I actually thought, “Oh I love this puzzle” at that moment.\n\nRajeswari sweetened the outing with beauty as well: MIDGE, PONZI SCHEMES, PLUMB, POLE CAR, BELOW THE BELT, RIPPED ABS, BLEEP, IMPOSTER.  Plus, she included lovely vague clues and misdirects.  \n\nSo yes, great promise evident here, IMO.\n\nTwo observations.  First, I’m amazed that BELOW THE BELT had never appeared in a Times puzzle before today.  Second, regarding RIDGY, which has drawn some raised eyebrows, well, I love this answer.  It looks terrific, is fun to say, and has far more bounce than “ridged”.  I’ve never thought of it before, never used it, and maybe never will, but I love it – thumbs up!\n\nRajeswari, congratulations on becoming a Times constructor, and please, forge on!

What you're really saying, even if you don't realize it, is that you weren't able to decode the trick, even though it's spelled out in the revealer, 61A.\n\nThat clue is [Many a gymgoer's goal … or what the starred clues in this puzzle must have for their answers to make sense?].  So you look at the theme clues, the ones that didn't make sense to you, the starred ones.  You must do something to those clues to make sense out of the answers.  The entry here is RIPPED ABS, so you should see that the starred clues need to have the ABs ripped out of them.\n\nWhen you rip AB out of any of these clues (for example, changing [Viable investment plans] (24A) to [Vile investment plans], the answer PONZI SCHEMES makes sense.  (Unless you don't know what a Ponzi scheme is.)  This works with all the theme answers, and after the rip, all of them make perfect sense.\n\nIn other words, the clues made no sense to you simply because you didn't understand the trick. (Adding or subtracting letters is a common way to make seemingly unrelated clues and answers align.)  But I did, and so did the many people who praised this puzzle.\n\nAs to \"Do better\", it's always obnoxious, but it's especially so when the commenter is clueless.","createDate":"1722524394","updateDate":"1722608519","approveDate":"1722524397","recommendations":21,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135121950,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eva H.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135122987","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-01","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5253617167472839}

Very impressive how quickly you got here.\n \nI tend to skip around the puzzle, building from what I know, which led me to the revealer early on. \nStill, I didn't know if it would be a rebus until the theme answers started filling in nicely, as complete words, but not making sense. That's when I checked the clues.\n\nPutting the trick in the clues is such a creative idea that i never get tired of it.\n\nIt's a bit of a shame that, to the detriment of this excellent trick, yesterday's puzzle also had us looking twice at the clues themselves. In other words, I was somewhat primed for it.\n\nAnd yet, that didn't take away from the joyful romp through this grid replete with clever, fresh, and rich fill. It didn't give rise to any ENNUI and, as a MYOPE, I feel seen.\n\nAs for RIDGY, some might not love it, but, of course, it's a word in its own right.

Congratulations, it must be a thrill to be chosen for publication. \n\nI really enjoyed this puzzle. It was challenging at times. I thought it was a rebus at first.  I had to check the wordplay column to get the trick in order to finish. It never occurred to me that the clue would have the missing letters! A real twist for me. My last fill was 16A. I don't know this word, so will look it up later. I didn't understand some of the unstarred clues, but was able to fill correctly with crosses and guessing. There may be a generation gap. I'm old and often don't know newer words used in slang or conversationally. In any case, it slows me up, but doesn't knock me out. Great fun and I have a wonderful sense of accomplishment finishing a Thursday puzzle. \n Watching Katy Ledecky stand and get her gold after breaking the world record for the 1500 meter individual swim.

Getting the trick was so deeply satisfying, and then as i got each subsequent clue’s answer i had an awesome thrill as they fell into place each time.  I liked how even getting the trick i had to think for awhile to get the answer, and needed some of the crosses for help.  Baby Talk was the last one I got, because I kept reading it with the emphasis on ‘by’ rather than ‘talk,’ so getting ORALLY actually made me understand the clue itself.\n\nAlso loved how lots of the other fill required a lot of thought, I had to not be too precious with my answers and erase and retry things until it all puzzled together.
