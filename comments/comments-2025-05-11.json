Sure the crosses helped, but when you can’t really guess the missing letters (like in RAKI) you need *ALL* the crosses. With other answers, like NAKEDSUN, at least it’s comprised of two common words and is pretty guessable once you get close.\n\nIn the end, for me, it came down to flyspecking the “E” I had put at the crossing of TeRAROAD and eRIE. I guess the Tara in Tara Road is a reference to Gone with the Wind? (I’ll look it up later), but TERA is a valid prefix meaning 10^12, and for a place in Chicago, the name of a Great Lake seemed much more likely than a random string of letters.\n\nI guess kudos for breaking the record for smallest number of black squares in a 21x21 grid, but sadly, I think the result was a rather uninspiring puzzle.","createDate":"1746943767","updateDate":"1747018651","approveDate":"1746943769","recommendations":29,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142043239","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5772764086723328}

We generally assume the first, but the second is equally valid, I've decided.\n\nCrossword clueing relies quite heavily on these often ignored language ambiguities.

That said, there *is* a historical “St. Pauli Brauerei” in Bremen, and they had a beer called “St.Pauli Girl” in the US market (brand still exists and used to be the second most popular brand of German beer in the US some decades ago). That said, for more than a century Bremen’s St. Pauli brewery has been bought up by Beck & Co.’s brewery (their most widely known beer in Germany being Beck’s). Beck &Co. have then also been bought by a Belgian brewery conglomerate called Interbrew and that one has since fusioned several times with other major brewery conglomerates including some in the US to become part of Anheuser-Busch InBev (the biggest brewery corporation in the world). So it no longer has much to do with the old St. Pauli Brewery in Bremen.\n\nThere also was a “Bavaria-St.Pauli Brauerei” in Hamburg which invented the Astra beer, but it no longer exists and the brand Astra is nowadays produced by the Holsten-Brauerei in Hamburg-Altona (the Holsten-Brauerei belongs to the Danish brewery conglomerate Carlsberg (third biggest brewery corp globally)), even if it’s (still) marketed as Thee Beer of Hamburg-St. Pauli (the red light and alternative culture district) for image reasons.","createDate":"1746998484","updateDate":"1747039009","approveDate":"1746998486","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142050541,"parentUserDisplayName":"Leonie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142051028","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7627513408660889}
