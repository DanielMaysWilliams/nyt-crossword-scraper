Some 40 years ago, a bit out of college, and traveling, I went there on a crowded day, lots of people on the beach and standing in the water.

Suddenly, it seems, everyone in the hoards on the beach and in the water looked at me in panic, pointing toward me, then started waving their hands overhead in an effort to get me to stop, shouting “NOOOOOOOOOO!”.  \n\nThat is what I remember most, that slow-motion cinematic moment with the panicked faces, yells, and motions.  Oh, happy ending, I did stop in time, and I learned that the hyper-saline water sharply stings the eyes; it's torture to be splashed upon.  But oh, did I unite a host of humans in terror that day!\n\nAs I did at the Dead Sea that day, I sprinted through your puzzle with zeal, John-Clark.
