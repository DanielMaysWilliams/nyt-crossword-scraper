Yup of course‚Ä¶ note the ‚Äúroughly‚Äù in the clue.\n\nBut you bring up a key point and one of my favorites.  Originally atomic mass used in the 1800‚Äôs because that was what they could measure. Then hands on experiment by Moseley deduced unexpectedly that atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus, was a better source of the causation of the pattern in the periodic table, and about the same time, isotopes of neon and then of other elements we‚Äôre unexpectedly discovered. \n\nFinally Einstein‚Äôs E=mc^2 finished the story of atomic mass, applied to the nuclear binding energy.\n\nTerrific journey of understanding the atom and the nucleus.","createDate":"1753318072","updateDate":"1753336271","approveDate":"1753318074","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143759158,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mary","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143763936","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7538105845451355}
