The penny finally dropped when POTATO appeared as I was working the downs. \n\nAnd very satisfying to see the (proper!) nomenclature appear at 58A, even if the timeliness was a happy accident. I missed the chime with the clue for 25A, which does contribute to an unintentional vibe. The urge to head off controversy, though, makes me sigh a bit. The NYT has been euphemising a lot of administrative crime in its coverage these days (\"illegal\" is not a word that appears in the filter terms for today's roundup of executive actions). To clutch our pearls at the first suggestion of the possibility of a sign of resistance feels like too much timidity.

I liked the challenge of figuring it out. But what if, instead of putting the theme clues in italics with a question mark, they had merely been in caps? IDENTITY stands out as different from the other clues, and for me realizing I had to parse the ID separately from the ENTITY would have been the same \"Oh, Hello!\" moment I got during my solve from the upper/lowercase in italics--plus the ID would look the way it does in an address.
