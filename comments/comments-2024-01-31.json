But now you've lived up to his legacy by your SUB-mission to New York City's paper of record, in the games section no less, where there is a gathering of intelligence like no other.* OK, the connection is a bit strained -- I'll keep working on it. Also, it shows noble character that you happily credited the editors for one of the better clues (POLYGRAPH). \n\nFunny puzzle, and this is probably the carping of a puzzle-twit, but I'd have preferred the long themers to have some kind of relationship with the particular bear they are crossing; I imagine that would have taken more intelligence gathering than humanly possible. On the other hand, the elegant working of the dizzying amount of double letters including twin vertical ING/INGs in the SW corner was dazzling. \n\nBet I wasn't the only one who filled in Chris ROCK at first up in the NW, only to have to REDDY up the ROCK soon after. (Man, my quips are so rough this time around I might need to gather a bit more intelligence myself!).\n\n* this has probably been talked about on the chatline, but there's a great article in one of the latest Vanity Fairs about the game staff and puzzlemeisters at the NYT, worth the read...\n\n<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/inside-the-new-york-times-big-bet-on-games\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/inside-the-new-york-times-big-bet-on-games</a>","createDate":"1706674391","updateDate":"1706752154","approveDate":"1706674393","recommendations":19,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130832847","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6182069182395935}

Essentially note perfect (and I had the score in my lap), but beyond the technical prowess on stunning display was the psychological and emotional penetration of his performance that sets him apart as a musician of rare ability and genius. On a par with Gould. Plus, he's a kind, outgoing person who treated us afterward with deference and charm. What a gift!

Those toy cars were a luxury here - barely available and prohibitively expensive in the 1980s, and still not cheap in the early 90s. \"Communist\" Poland had virually no imports from the West, and what little was imported (the state had a monopoly on foreign imports, btw) was sold in special state-owned shops, called Pewex. That name was an acronym, formed from Przedsiębiorstwo Eksportu Wewnętrznego - meaning Internal Export Enterprise. Internal Export? What on earth was that? Well, whatever the state imported it was then free to sell domestically, and that was called Internal Export. That economy made no sense at all.\n\nWell, anyway, in the 1980s you could buy matchbox toys in Pewex only, and you had to pay in dollars. Exchange rates for dollars were crazy - an average person made enough złoty (Polish currency, złoty means golden) to live well, but in dollars a monthly salary was like 10 or 20 or thereabouts. Very few of us kids had any Western toys.\n\nAnd yet I am nostalgic about my childhood.","createDate":"1706677678","updateDate":"1706823909","approveDate":"1706677680","recommendations":49,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130833193,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eric Hougland","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130833555","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5663015842437744}

The city was safe, state-run kindergartens and schools were very good, there were playgrounds set among well-designed apartment buildings (where you were given a comfortable place to live without having to pay for it). Their residents formed close-knit communities which provided support to all members - our neighbors were like an extended family (I met some of these people at my mom's  funeral, for the first time in decades, and it felt like coming home. The feeling of togetherness was still there). There were few luxuries, especially of the Western kind, but in general life was good, for kids. Adults - especially those like my parents, well educated, well travelled, and with a thirst for freedom - must have found it much more frustrating. \n\nQuality of life suffered for many years after the fall of \"communism.\" Before we reaped the benefits of democracy and a market economy, we had to suffer through the aftermath of the collapse of the state-run economy. The early 90s were harsh, but my parents managed to rediscover themselves in the new Poland quite quickly. Some people never recovered though, which explained the success of populist in the 2015 and 2019 elections. That nothwithstanding, I am amazed by the transformation of the past 30 years. In some respects, life in Poland is no worse than in the West these days, and we finally see improvement in what usually was our Achilles heel - road safety.\n\n/End spam","createDate":"1706682722","updateDate":"1706766976","approveDate":"1706682724","recommendations":47,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130833917,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eric Hougland","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130834340","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-31","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7706487774848938}

So that when I say READIED A ROCK, it really doesn't sound all that much like READY TO ROCK.

You can't get a gold star two days or twenty years after the puzzle first appeared, and you won't see it connected with a line to a nearby puzzle, representing a streak. Blue stars count neither for or against your current (or old) streaks. Mini CWPs, Bonus CWPs, etc., aren't counted for streaks.\n\nI think an Archive CWP does count for or against your Solve Rate in Statistics, depending whether you get the blue star on a puzzle you start there. Getting a hint such as whether a Word or Square is correct will block you from a gold star and therefore reset your current streak on today's puzzle, but you can still get a blue star on the calendar and perhaps increase your Solve Rate for successfully completing a puzzle after getting one or more hints on a puzzle old or new.","createDate":"1706728134","updateDate":"1706751520","approveDate":"1706728137","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130843622,"parentUserDisplayName":"lawrenceb56","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130847733","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.892852783203125}
