Not only did they find nine synonyms for narrow spaces, but they interlinked them, made every one of them a part of a word or phrase, AND found a way to have the letters of Andy’s full name appear IN ORDER through the escape.  And with all this going on, they filled in the whole area cleanly!!!\n\nHello?  Hello?
