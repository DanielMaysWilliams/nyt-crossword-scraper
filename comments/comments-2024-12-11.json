So I think the clue is fine.\n\nThe whole thing reminds me of a scene from The Honeymooners, a 50s sitcom that was very popular here and was shown in reruns forever afterwards.  It was about a working class couple in Brooklyn--he was a bus driver, she a housewife--and their two best friends.  Sort of like I Love Lucy at the low end of the economic spectrum.  (The Flintstones were based on The Honeymooners.)\n\nIn one episode, the couple manages to take a vacation to Italy--I don't remember the circumstances; maybe they won a contest.  The wife asks the husband for some spending money, and he gives her something like 100,000 LIRE.  She was so thrilled at his generosity.

They always have names, of various kinds. Warsaw has Winnie the Pooh Street, for example (ul. Kubusia Puchatka). The oldest names had to do with geography or what sort of people lived somewhere. Warsaw's Old Town has streets the like of Szewska (Shoemaker street), and a street that originally was laid out on an embankment across swampy terrain is called Twarda (Hard street, because the embankment used stones and gravel). In my part of Warsaw, which was laid out in the 1970s and 1980s to replace old villages, the names of those villages survive in some street names. I grew up on ul. Zamiany - named for the village Zamiana which existed there for centuries before. Incidentally, zamiana means swap, so probably the name originated when local nobles exchanged pieces of land, commemorating it in the place name.\n\nAlso, our territorial divisions almost never use grids, or even straight lines.

I was immensely surprised and gratified to learn that the name of that road is older than US independence, and that it was used when the King’s men marched up to Danbury.\n\nThe founders of this neck of the woods were called The Outlanders, because they took the king’s offer to try to start farms in from the shore, where rocks are our natural crop. As soon as they discovered the boring rock-free flatness that is the Midwest - they all skedaddled. Christopher Plummer, a longtime Weston resident, played a role in an indie film about it.\n\nThe most significant road name in town is Long Lots. Long Lots was an 18th-c. French solution to wealth inequality, and features in Connecticut, French Canada and Louisiana. The lots fronted on the King’s Highway or the riverfront in 50-yard widths and went back from there up to several miles (also called ribbon farms, but not here). In that way, everyone had equal access for commerce. Wonder why that didn’t catch on? 😬 When I hike in the woodlands here I see stone fences running due north and south spaced 50 yards apart in otherwise wild woods.
