Alvin’s visits often took the shape of coffee and conversation after dropping his kids off at school. They discussed things including family, life, hobbies and current events. Some days grandpa would invite Alvin for steak dinners, but other days they’d barely speak and spend the morning watching the news.\n\n“The important thing was his presence: the conscious, routine decision to be involved and engaged, and to make the mundane life of an old man meaningful. Tonight, this morning, whenever you’re reading this, take a few minutes to say hello and check in with someone older whom you care about.

I loved the clue for AREPA because it compared them to pupusas, a term I recently learned from my favorite book of the past year, Dave Eggers’ “The Eyes and the Impossible”. Pupusas are mentioned several times and I had to look them up, as I didn’t know what they were. If you haven’t read it, give it a try. It’s magical.

Cool!  Clever!” and such.   Just for a moment, though. Then you move on, leave it behind, but your mood has raised a notch.\n\nThis happened again and again today, for instance, with [Something made just for show?] for SET, [Competitions with many missions] for SPACE RACE, and [Ready for a drive, perhaps?] for ON CD.\n\nI leave a puzzle like this awed and grateful, surging into the day ahead.\n\nThat surge today was buttressed by beauty in the box.  That center stack with not only gorgeous answers but ringing with freshness, with the middle answer used only once before in a Times puzzle, sandwiched by two debut answers.  Plus, the lovely longs of SODA BREAD, RAW NERVES, UMPTEENTH, and TEEN VOGUE.  And the loveliest of all: EPHEMERAL.\n\nAll this goodness just from letters in a box – amazing!
