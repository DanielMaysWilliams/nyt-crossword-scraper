Some years ago I needed a root canal, and the endodontist has a large selection of films that the patient could watch during the procedure. Wanting some lighthearted entertainment that I knew I would enjoy, I chose \"Finding NEMO\". I did not recall that this film included a scene of a patient undergoing a painful root canal! When it got to that scene I groaned, as the kind endo assured me that I would not be experiencing that kind of pain in his office (and he was right).
