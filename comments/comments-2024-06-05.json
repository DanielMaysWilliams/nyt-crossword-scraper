It’s comprised of the counties of Somerset and Avon (where I live) and Dorset. The Somerset Levels, of which the magical area of Glastonbury is the chief town, is the once marshland where Alfred hid from the Danes. It’s reclaimed land now but still floods during wet weather. The name Somerset derives from the old English ‘summer’s people’, so named because they needed to move community and animals to higher ground in winter to avoid the floods.

They tended to gather at the spots where the snipers were hidden, investigating. \n\nThis was a great help to the Allied soldiers, as it tipped off both the presence and the location of the Germans. \n\nAnd that’s how the cows of Normandy supported the Allied cause in the Second World War.","createDate":"1717594515","updateDate":"1717730141","approveDate":"1717594517","recommendations":35,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133693647","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.53711998462677}
