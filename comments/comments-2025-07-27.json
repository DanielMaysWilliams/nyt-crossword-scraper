Not loving this journey for me. HARRUMPH!  😏  \n\nOnce again, I was clipping along my merry way but could not come up with the cross of PRO? and SI?IL for the life of me. I certainly know that music but I didn't know it was ever called PROG. I looked it up later and see that it is short for progressive rock but all I could come up with at the time was the possibility of PROm, which really didn't make a lot of sense... although dancing to \"We don't need no education\" at one's prom might be kind of cool, though I never did go to prom. Not really my thing and I was a bridesmaid many times in that era, so I didn't lack for the big froofie '80s and early '90s frocks! Ooh, boy, I had some doozies!! 💃\n\nAnyhow, it was my last square and I don't allow myself to run through the alphabet in the app, so when my taking a chance on PROm didn't work I did the reveal. \n\nAnd SIGIL is another word I just don't know. My voice to text just spelled it absolutely correctly on the first attempt, so it must be known well enough. \n\nI love the word SVELTE for some reason. It just rolls off one's tongue! Although, for the record, my voice to text does not spell that one correctly. \n\nAnyhow, lots of errands today so this puzzle was a good way to come home and chill out afterwards. \n\nLastly, and this is important: We are GENERATION X!! We don't need no stinkin' EXONERATION!! Yeah!!

Sundays are beasts to make – you not only have to come up with a worthy theme, but you have to design a grid to accommodate it, fill it, and come up with clues for some 140 words!\n\nJohn not only does this ably, but he injects humor and inventiveness as well.  Here’s an example from today’s puzzle that incorporates both – [Apt name for a narcissist?] for MIMI.  That’s an answer seen well more than 100 times in the major crossword outlets, almost always clued to a famous Mimi in real life or the character in Rent or La Bohème, but never with the narcissism angle before.  Plus, the clue made me smile.\n\nIt’s a little thing, that MIMI clue, but also a big thing.\n\nI’ve learned over time that when I see John’s name atop a puzzle, I know I’m in for the unexpected and for a dip into levity, and I plunge in with great expectations.  And, as with today’s puzzle, I end up well rewarded.\n\nJust want to thank you for that, John.

I had to keep moving around the grid, looking for footholds, and although nothing stumped me that much, it didn't seem like a \"Very Easy\" puzzle to me, despite the stats and the anecdotal evidence in others' comments.\n\nYesterday (i.e. Fri. night), I was not especially tired, and had no obvious reason not to have breezed through the puzzle.  I just didn't.\n\nToday (actually last night), I had just gotten home from a visit to my kids and other relatives in Philadelphia, where I had no opportunity to rest, and helped my nephew assemble some furniture and other physical tasks, as he and his family are also moving soon.  After a heavy restaurant meal with the family, we headed back home and got there around 9:45, with me at the wheel.  \n\nI should have been quite tired as I opened the crossword and began solving.  However, I was able to put in a time 22% faster than my Sun. average, and a minute or so faster than the median time listed on xwstats.  \n\nDidn't comment on this last night, since I was quite tired by the end.

Because Scrooge had no Christmas spirit in his heart at the beginning of the story, he assumed that those displaying it (through acts of charity, generosity, merriment, etc.) were just faking it to make themselves look better.
