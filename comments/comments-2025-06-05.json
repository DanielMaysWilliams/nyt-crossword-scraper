I'd have felt a little cheated if there were only two or three.  \n\nThe grid itself seemed like it was ripe for trickiness, so as soon as I realized it seemed rebussy, which I am always FOR, I went to work on the revealer and got it with a small handful of crossings. Knowing the revealer helped me in some areas and not as much in others. Count me of those who couldn't figure out ST(and)ING other than maybe in a physical stretching sort of way, but S(IF)TING makes much more sense. \n\nIt came down to the crossing of TOLE? and OAS?S for me. I was just not getting the flat reference at all. Thought it was a musical thing. I was worried I wasn't going to get the crossing and I'd have to accept defeat on what was otherwise a fairly fast and VERY fun solve, but suddenly the T in OASTS jumped into my brain from some past puzzle because it is absolutely not a word I otherwise known. \n\nHuzzah, ole brain of mine!!!

It’s not an invalid argument. If you and I are talking in person and you say something I object to, and I yell “Steve!”  instead of “using my words,” if you will, I have just turned your proper noun of a name into an interjection. \n\nI do disagree that Om becomes an interjection in English by the virtue of its being chanted by many English speakers without understanding what it means. That’s like saying that when I say “Carburetor!” the word stops being a noun describing [insert here what it describes because I don’t know] and becomes an interjection because I mouthed it without comprehension. (FWIW, I utter neither Om! nor Carburetor! in the course of a normal year.)\n\nThe reason I brought up the Tetragrammaton is that I’m assuming it carries the connotation of the ineffability of the divine, much like Om does. I was also under the impression that its placement in scriptures can often be invocatory, like that of Om.\n\nOf course, it’s a crossword puzzle so most bets are off. \n\n(Except when Paracelsus is called a Greek physician.

Per Wikipedia:\n\n\"Black and Blue\" debuted in the Broadway musical Hot Chocolates (1929), sung by Edith Wilson. Razaf biographer Barry Singer recounts that the lyricist was coerced into writing the song (with music by Waller) by the show's financier, New York mobster Dutch Schultz, though Razaf subverted Schultz's directive that it be a comedic number:[4]\n‘He demanded a comedy song for a lady who says how tough it is to be black...He literally put a gun to Andy's head and told him that if he didn't write it he would never write again. The opening-night response to the song was silence -people were stunned. Then they went crazy. Andy hadn't written the comedy song Schultz wanted, but because it was a hit, Schultz left him alone.’\n— Barry Singer, author of \"Black and Blue: The Life and Lyrics of Andy Razaf” [5]\nIn the show, Wilson originally sang the song from a bed with white sheets, but the bed was removed after the first show due to the judgement that it was too suggestive.[6]\nThe show also included Waller and Razaf's hit songs \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\".[7]","createDate":"1749141981","updateDate":"1749165350","approveDate":"1749141981","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142615899,"parentUserDisplayName":"sotto voce","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142629608","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7407378554344177}

Glad to have connected you to a poet of such biographical relevance!\n\nI wonder which of the many species tentatively identified with moly Burt was thinking of?\n\nWhen I was in the midst of studying anaesthetic pharmacology, there was a bit of a pharmacological stir about moly, summarized in this 1983 article from the NYT:\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/mtkfcfpb\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/mtkfcfpb</a>\n\n(I'm hoping I've embedded a free share in that link.)\n\nThe hypothesis was that Circe had used an anticholinergic drug to poison Ulysses' crew. The plant named in the original paper is Datura stramonium, known in the USA as jimsonweed. The authors went on to suggest that an anticholinesterase present in the snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis, would act as an antidote, making it a candidate to be Hermes' moly.\n\nOne hitch in all this seems to me to be that Datura is a New World native, and probably didn't reach Europe until the sixteenth century! But I suppose we could invoke an Old World anticholinergic, like henbane, to be Circe's poison.","createDate":"1749156831","updateDate":"1749166434","approveDate":"1749156832","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142621165,"parentUserDisplayName":"Oikofuge","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142635702","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8616353869438171}

I believe someone else mentioned a microwave that does the same thing.\n\nThese things are obviously not the same as a physical switch on a clock radio, which so many claim and which I’d really like to see (Rachel still hasn’t provided that photo 🤔), but they are indeed AM/PM toggles on digital clocks. In my opinion they are more convincing than Sam Lyon’s alarm toggle within a digital clock app, but that is certainly arguable and may be enough for many.\n\nYour comment, though, to think of AM/PM as *the thing which is toggled*, was particularly useful, as it doesn’t require any consideration of whether an alarm in a clock app still counts as a clock, or if a toggle that only exists in a virtual state for a moment while you’re setting the time counts, and so on.\n\nSo I have changed my thinking; I believe it skates under the line of technically correct through the ability of the English language to name things after the processes which are done to them—which is, of course, the only kind of correct that matters here. AM/PM is a toggle in the same way I can eat a traybake.

That was the case with most of the themed clues, and I'm still not sure I understood all of them. (\"Street urchins\" = \"waifs\" I think?)\n\nThen, I felt the fill was difficult to nail down given all the gaps the very pervasive theme left, and I thought many of the clues were a little questionable (e.g. never seen \"AM/PM\" as a toggle on a traditional digital clock, \"asps\" is too specific an answer for the Indiana Jones clue, I've exceedingly rarely had to prepay for my reservations at hotels and restaurants).\n\nAll in all, this Thursday took me as much time as some of my longer Saturday puzzles, but I usually enjoy Saturday puzzles a lot more.
