I remember that when I was a kid, the first thing I’d do after getting to the beach is dig the deepest hole I could.  \n\nI did some more digging post-puzzle to determine the origin of “Hole” in “Jackson Hole”.  Turns out the area named after fur trapper David Jackson, who worked the area in the 1820s, and “Hole” was a trapper’s term for a large mountain valley. Huh!\n\nI did notice that the theme nouns – HOLE, DITCH, PIT, and WELL – can also be verbs.  Then I saw words that can be both nouns and verbs all over the grid.  A partial list: STREAK, SCAT, SCAN, RAIL, SLAM, TANK, GROWL, YOYO.  \n\nA little more digging revealed that 30-50% of high-frequency vocabulary in English can be both noun and verb, but only about 10% of all the words in the dictionary can.  You’re welcome.\n\nI love the constructor mind that saw the two interpretations of DIGIT and had to make a puzzle out of that.

He also is careful to emphasize that his criticisms are always his own personal opinions which may not be always mainstream. I usually find his posts refreshing.\n\nLast, here’s why some of us get a bit annoyed, and take it as some respectful feedback for you. Often people post implied criticism of clues without doing their own research. Type “are Iran and Iraq in Asia?”  in Google and you get your answer. You might still feel like commenting—“I didn’t realize that they were in Asia” or even “Interesting how Asian has a connotation that doesn’t usually include the Middle East”—etc. etc. Your first post came off as a little flip. If you had just posted your second I don’t think you would have gotten the same response. It happens, I’ve been guilty of it myself—posting about some incorrect fact that I thought was true without researching it—and have gotten called out on it, sometimes condescendingly. But the original fault was mine and I tried to admit that graciously.","createDate":"1765212186","updateDate":"1765258895","approveDate":"1765212187","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147147687,"parentUserDisplayName":"Judith Nelson","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147149544","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5562191009521484}
