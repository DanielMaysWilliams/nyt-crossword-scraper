Is that called LACK of virtue signaling?\n\nHaving just had a lovely bowl of pesto and glass of claret, I am in the mood to discourse on the difference between pestare -- to crush -- and schiacciare -- to crush ... Pestare is pounding, multiple, repeated applications of force, such as grinding, mashing, as with a mortar and pestle, to make paste, whereas schiacciare is to crush with continuous force, steady pressure. There is a slight crossover when it comes to mashing, one uses pestare for mashing up herbs, schiacciare for mashing potatoes. It depends what you're mashing, since potatoes can be smooshed, herbs cannot.

No big deal. \n\nUnusual puzzle find today. A Sunday from April 29, 2007 by Henry Hook with the title: \"Circle of Friends.\" Quite incredible piece of construction. Eight theme answers, all of them proper names, and each of them clued in connection with the following theme answer (and the last one clued in connection with the first). Those clues and answers: \n\n23a: ... \"and 25-Across have \"canine\" surnames :\" \nMARKSPITZ\n\n25a: \"... and 41-Across sang with their siblings :\" \nJUNEPOINTER\n\n41a: \"... and 52-Across are Mormons :\" \nDONNYOSMOND\n\n52a: \"... and 69-Across have affiliations with \"Jeopardy!\" :\"\nKENJENNINGS\n\n69a: \"... and 80-Across have mythological creatures as surnames :\"\n MERVGRIFFIN\n\n80a: \"... and 99-Across starred in musicals and share their first names with a classic sitcom couple :\" \nETHELMERMAN\n\n99a: \"... and 101-Across are known for their fancy footwork:\" \nFREDASTAIRE\n\n101a: \"... and 23-Across are Olympic gold medalists :\"\nCARLLEWIS\n\nWow.

So any of the three could be considered a “set of genes” and loosely called a GENESET, even though only the last one has that official terminology.\nIf that’s too confusing, think of it this way. If you and I collect baseball cards, and both have exactly the same cards, that’s our GENOTYPE. If you and I only collect American League teams, and someone else collects National League teams, then we have the same GENOME and they don’t—it’s like the set of cards you can pick from. And each team could be considered a group of similar cards—that’s our GENESET.\nSo it would be like saying you and I both have the same CARDSET if our cards are the same—true enough, but a little imprecise and maybe not the terminology real card collectors would use.

It doesn’t have to be the best way to say something, it doesn’t have to be the most up to date way to say something. Most significantly, it doesn’t have to be how the people who work in the field it comes from use or don’t use it. Up to this point, I’m talking about the basic rules of crossword construction as they have existed since crosswords first showed up a hundred and some years ago. \n\nAnything else is opinion. You may not like certain words. It has been documented, for example, that many people have an aversion to the word “moist.”  That doesn’t make it a bad word. \n\nOther people don’t like words that they aren’t familiar with, or that are not used in their correct technical sense. (All those who nitpick at math cluing, form a line segment to the right.)\n\nYou and everyone else are entitled to have an opinion. But keep in mind, on Fridays and Saturdays, clues are meant to not be intuitive or easy.  Too many people want to be able to solve every puzzle with no challenge. Would [Stuffed ___] been a better clue for you? If you’ve heard of the dish, maybe. If not, you’d probably cry “Too obscure!”\n\nA line has to be drawn via-à-vis usability, and that line is often simply “Is it a word?” \nNot “Is it everyone’s favorite word?” And DERMA is a word. \n\nDisagree if you must.
