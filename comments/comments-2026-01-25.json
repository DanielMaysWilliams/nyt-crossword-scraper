A postdoc is  usually hired as an underling under the mentorship of an established academic. But it is still essentially a research position and the postdoc is a junior colleague, not merely a student.\n\nHowever, my first postdoc was a merit-based fellowship awarded by a premier marine laboratory. I had no formal mentor there  -- I did the research I outlined in my proposal, on my own and at my own volition. Yet when I first arrived at the lab, I was told the lab's Associate Director would be my \"mentor\" -- and that just meant he would help me learn the ropes there. His area of research was only tangentially related to my own. He was a great guy and I relished his friendship, but he never really mentored me in the science. \n\nMy second postdoc had two mentors, one of whom was a complete jerk. Our funding got pulled after I was there 6 months, and I think it was a blessing, in spite of the disruption to my career. The reason the funding was pulled is a story for another time.
