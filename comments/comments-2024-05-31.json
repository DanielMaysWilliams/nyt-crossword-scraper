I really enjoyed the puzzle and for me it was the right balance of “I’m never gonna figure out this one” to “hey, I actually did it”.  I must say that Deb’s comments  were really exceptional, especially her ponzu recipe. Also, to get a constructor about to attend Harvey Mudd just a day after having that entry in the puzzle is pretty special. Finally, I wanted to touch base early as there was a very late comment yesterday from Alena from California. She commented that yesterday was the first time she had been able to complete a rebus puzzle and she was so thrilled. EH from Austin welcomed her to the “dark side”. I had previously commented that yesterday could have been the perfect chance for Joel to offer a Wednesday rebus to help attract newer solvers to warm up to the idea. I offer the example of the rebus puzzle of Wednesday  3/4/2009, which was remarkably similar to yesterdays’.

The term exists and is grammatically correct. There are many ETHERS that a chemist might discuss in a chemistry lecture, for example anisole which has a smell of anise or licorice. But the clue refers to , “They’ll knock you out.” Diethyl ether, commonly referred to as just, “ether” is the only one I ever studied in my anesthesia training. So on the face of it I would agree with you, that the plural is inappropriate. However, now I see that historically “vinyl ether” was for awhile used as an inhalational anesthetic, so ETHERS may technically be correct. We all know about Steve L’s TCS (which I believed he proposed renaming to the more scientific Extreme Proximity Syndrome, but was lost in the OCS/anxiety fiasco) , but do we have a reverseTCS where an answer is technically correct, but so out of normal usage to be absurd?
