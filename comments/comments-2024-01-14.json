One small critique that threw me for a while, the meaning of \"BEEFED\", at least to us younger folks is less complaint than it is conflict. Beef as a noun vs a verb have evolved into different slang terms. Saying \"I'd had beef with them/that\" would mean complaint, but the verb form of \"I beefed/I'm beefing with them\" implies an interaction of some sort. The Cambridge dictionary conflated the two with their definition, and their example phrase \"he was beefing about having to do the shopping\", is not a way I've heard the word used in common parlance. It might have had that grammatical usage in the past, I don't know.\n\nTLDR: nowadays, beef as complaint is usually congugated as a noun, whereas congugated as a verb it is more synonymous to \"feud\".","createDate":"1705219514","updateDate":"1706984439","approveDate":"1705219516","recommendations":12,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130444384","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4796401560306549}

Anatomically, it's the *pectoralis minor* muscle. As such, it's not equivalent to the tenderloin of a mammal--beef or pork--which would be the *psoas major* (located nearer the rump of the animal). Ironically, in more muscular birds--the chickens that never skip bench-press days at the gym--there are tendons which run down the tenderloins, which make them not tender at all. Since any given bird has only two of them, \" chicken fingers\" usually include the tenderloins as well as the main breast (*pectoralis major*) cut into strips.\n\nUnfortunately, the link in Caitlin's column is blocked to games-only subscribers like myself.

Despite being thrown to by no less than Dan Marino in his prime, setting team and league records along the way, he only made it to the Super Bowl once in a losing effort. And he wasn't considered important enough to work into this theme clue. Double whammy.\n\nSo we can eliminate that sorry angle and, instead,  move on to breaking down \"ape\".\n\nIf you are an ape, hopefully you are a human, but if not, you could be a chimp, a bonobo (i.e. a randy chimp with a funky caboose and gender-neural-pattern baldness), a gorilla, an orangutan or even a gibbon (the only extant \"lesser\" ape, which isn't very nice, but I don't make the rules and honestly I don't think they mind).\n\nYou can also be one who apes, meaning one who mimics someone or something. Mimicry is a form of deception. The verb \"to dupe\" means \"to fool\" or \"to deceive\".\n\nSo if you are a great ape, you may be a kind of bipedal menace OR you could be a super -good at duping AKA a super duper.\n\nTook me a while to noodle this one too. Side note: Dolphins were eliminated by the Chiefs. No comment from Mark Super Duper as of yet but stay tuned.","createDate":"1705217962","updateDate":"1705301327","approveDate":"1705217964","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130444244,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rod D","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130444355","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-14","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5571666359901428}

Cryptic puzzles are not clued ‚Äúvaguely‚Äù. They‚Äôre impenetrable to you because you haven‚Äôt cracked the code yet. Cryptics are written according to some very well-defined rules, but they‚Äôre not obvious to you. To be fair, I don‚Äôt care for cryptics myself, but I understand how they‚Äôre clued. I once did a few to completion to make sure I actually could do them, but stopped because I found I didn‚Äôt enjoy them. \n\nIt reminds me of the many people who think baseball is boring because they only have a superficial understanding of the game, and they don‚Äôt see as much running around as they do in football and basketball.","createDate":"1705254236","updateDate":"1705811619","approveDate":"1705254238","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130445952,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mike","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130452352","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.553916335105896}
