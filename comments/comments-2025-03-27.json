Kosovo resident.

Flamsteed was asking Newton about his recent work on optical theory, but Newton's mouth was full, and all he could utter was an \"omnomnom\" (or was that a  \"nomnomnom\"? Accounts differ.) Newton was, in fact, helping himself to another serving roast beef, when Halley, whose mouth was parched from that dry-as-dust oatcake, reached for the pitcher of ale, and inadvertently bumped Newton, causing him to spill gravy all over his front (\"For every action, there is an equal, but opposite reaction\").\n\nAnd thus Celestial Mechanics was born.\n\n***\n\nDon't get me started on \"food sensitivities,\" but I gotta drop in to say that, although OATS do not contain gluten*, they are frequently eschewed but persons striving to keep a gluten-free lifestyle. Oats are frequently processed in mills which also process gluteny grains, and cross-contamination is considered possible. Some companies offer \"certified gluten-free\" oats, for which they charge more. \n\n*unlike RYE and barley, both of which contain more gluten than wheat.

Then in 1998/1999 there was the Kosovo war.\n\nAlso, these days Croatia is one of Europe's favorite vacation spots. Strangely, since 1988 I visited the region only twice: my family drove through Serbia on our way to Greece in 1998, but we only stopped for lunch there, and then in 2018 when my wife and I were in the Austrian Alps and it rained like crazy, we drove for a day trip to sunny Piran in Slovenia.
