I finally finished it with lots of help yesterday and completed the weeks puzzles including Saturday. They were all just fine. So on to today with a great deal of initial trepidation. But I shouldn't have worried. This one was enjoyable and doable in one sitting.  My brain didn't melt down. There were some tricky clues.  The \"gives it the ol college try\" was one that I struggled with.  It was the last of my solves and found it a shoehorn to get the crosses in. I'm sure all constructors have to do that from time to time, but it diminishes the puzzle for me. \"ole or old\", but \"ol?\" It's a puzzle.\n\nIt's a gorgeous day here in Central Texas.  We had a cool front that blew all the humidity further south. So Cheers for a lovely day wherever you are. Thank you Meghan Morris for a great start to the day with your lovely puzzle.

As with this week's Friday and Saturday puzzles, it hit a good balance between challenging and doable -- on the one hand there was a time when I wasn't sure I would finish, and on the other there was no time when an obscure, unknown answer was rendered impossible by an equally obscure crossing.  Everything was figure-out-able.  \n\nThe theme was also a good one.
