The awards show was what actually clinched the puzzle for me!! I hadn't noticed I had AEREOLAs, and couldn't for the life of me figure out how SA_RNS could answer \"Brings in\". Not to mention, the nickname was drawing a blank until... Jay-Z was awarded the Dr. DRE Global Impact award. Dr. DRE, our old crossword friend! Deserving of a gold star in my book. Woo hoo!! \n\nNice, fresh fill throughout this puzzle. I'm a little surprised at the comments saying the theme was mundane... While the aphorisms for the most part came easily enough for me, it was re-reading the answers in light of the clues that got them to sing! I especially liked \"Fine line?\". If you CAN'T COMPLAIN, you sure are feeling fine! \n\nAnd with that, happy Monday all!","createDate":"1707111993","updateDate":"1707171807","approveDate":"1707111996","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130938145","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6432957649230957}

David Garrick removed the Induction for a 1754 production and that became the standard for over a century.\n\n\"The Induction, finely written, establishes a fundamentally serious concern with the powers of persuasion to change not merely appearance but reality, and this theme is acted out at different levels in both strands of the subsequent action.\" \n--------------------------------------------\nThe play-within-a-play concept also allows for the fictional characters to exaggerate for comic effect.

One think that might help is to consider that the “?” can signal a play on words or some misdirection, not always a pun.  “Gives a hand” most commonly means “helps”.  But with the question mark, the playful answer becomes “CLAPS”.  That kind of cleverness made me smile.  \n\nThis was very similar to 36A:  “Preserves thing?” was not the action one might have thought without a question mark. The play-on-words answer is JARS.   I initially put in JAMS, but corrected with the cross.  Still a good clue/answer. \n\nFor me it was fun and well done Sunday puzzle.","createDate":"1707077359","updateDate":"1707328555","approveDate":"1707077361","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130931519,"parentUserDisplayName":"hitthejohn","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130933296","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5369649529457092}
