Apparently, facts and reality are of no interest to them. If they, personally, have not heard of a word before, then that word does not exist. I have to assume they either don't know what a dictionary is, to believe that they already know all the words that are found therein. Or, if they do have a dictionary, on the rare occasion that they check it before posting their \"I GOTCHA!\" complaint, they do not read past the first definition. Or maybe they think that only the first definition one might find in a dictionary is the only valid definition for crosswords.
