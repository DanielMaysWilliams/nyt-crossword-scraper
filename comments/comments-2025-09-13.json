The bottom spanners took me longer to put together, and I had to use my slightly nerve-wracking strategy of typing in likely partial answers (ELSE and TUCKERED made sense and turned out to work, although I stumbled over the fact that \"all\" didn't provide enough letters before getting PAWPAW off AWNS and therefore having that necessary P to start PLUM with.)

Reading over (and completely missing) typos, determining what a person meant even if the syntax was odd, that sort of thing.  Even our eyesight is fuzzy in the sense that much of what we think we are seeing is actually the brain filling in some of the field of vision.  This speeds us up, whether we evolved as predator or prey.\n\nSometimes we have to stretch our minds a bit into not entirely perfect situations.\n\nSo, yes, there may be a loss of \"accuracy\" when something like this occurs, but the alternative would be to sacrifice this gorgeous puzzle for the sake of accuracy, something I'm glad the \"accuracy-hating editors\" we willing to accept.\n\nTo paraphrase something Barry once wisely said, don't do brain surgery or proctology based on what you learn in crosswords.

What's the gas?  Well, water, water vapor.  The ice turns into water vapor, a gas. That's why they start to come apart as they approach the sun, and sometimes don't survive.\n\nAs for ice on Jupiter, there is a whole lot of hydrogen there, so any oxygen I would suppose would be in the form of water.  If that's the case, it's not impossible there could be layers of Jupiter's atmosphere where the temperature would support snow, albeit snow under enormous pressure.  \n\nI am wallowing in the most outrageous conjecture here.

Biased samples are not useless. Bias is usually an issue of degree, not biased vs. not.\n\nYou wonder, I think, if one of the biases is that the tougher the puzzle, the greater the percent of non-finishers, and are these non-finishers excluded from the sample times. I think the answer has to be “yes,” and so, as puzzle difficulty increases, the population from which the sample is chosen decreases. It is likely that this smaller population has an average solve time (for whatever day of the week) that is shorter than that for the sample from the larger population that provides Xwstats solve-time data points for “easier” puzzles.
