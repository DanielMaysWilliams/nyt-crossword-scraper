It’s already been mentioned that there are no O’s in the grid aside from the golf ball’s bath (Hi, @Steve L!), and that the path travels through all three words of HOLE INONE SHOT.

Several times I filled in an answer only to have to erase it and put in another.  That rarely happens to me on a Monday, and I love it!\n\nLovely serendipities as well.  How the theme of O’s is echoed by OWE.  Three palindromes (LOL, AMA, URU).  How TEE and CUP together make “teacup” – it’s a silly coincidence, I know, but I love silly coincidences like this!\n\nAnyway, Jeremy, you are a standout constructor in all aspects of puzzle-making, as today’s puzzle exhibits.

I just wanted to point out an interesting clue/entry in an archive puzzle I did yesterday. It’s 1/4/2020 , 2D, “U.S. radio station whose call letters spell out the name of its city.” I immediately filled in WACO, only to erase it when I realized that the city is west of the Mississippi and should begin with “K”. But now I see that of the 23 or so radio/TV stations there, one does start with a “W”. This same clue for WACO (with a whopping total 178 appearances) has been used twice before this, ( 2014 and 2004), so be ready for it. FWIW, the two other cities that could work are WARE (AM station in MA) and  WISE ( FM in VA).","createDate":"1715604533","updateDate":"1715616345","approveDate":"1715604535","recommendations":4,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133167609","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9445741176605225}

Some were much more obvious than others but in any case it was a fun puzzle and I enjoyed it a lot!\n\nAnd then I went directly into today's puzzle, which was much quicker but also LOADS OF FUN!

When I was on a greens crew as a teenager, one of our first jobs in the early a.m. was to move each hole on each green, to keep the course interesting and shift the wear and tear around the green.  First, you would use a simple tool to extract the cup from the existing hole.  Then, you use another tool to cut out a new hole, like extracting a cylindrical soil core sample the exact same circumference and depth as the old hole.  You drop the cylinder of soil with its turf top into the old hole, drop the cup into the new hole, and then place the flag in the center hole of the cup.\n\nBelieve it our not, there is some thought into where you cut a hole. It can’t be too close to the apron or the old hole, can’t be on a ridiculously difficult slope, or in a ridiculously easy gully.  Regardless of how careful you are in choosing a given day’s cup placement, there will be members who complain that the day’s configuration was too difficult, and others who will complain that it was too easy.\n\nIt reminds me of something else, but I can’t quite put my finger on it…","createDate":"1715571684","updateDate":"1715743873","approveDate":"1715571687","recommendations":40,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133162439,"parentUserDisplayName":"sotto voce","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133164166","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8443397283554077}

Monday of the year for sure, perhaps Monday of the decade. So we have a family laugh at one particular Prevagen commercial. I don’t know if it’s common knowledge outside the medical community, but the white coats worn have a particular significance. Most med schools in recent years hold a “white coat ceremony” for new med students to don one for the first time. For the idea, see:\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2pmnaewa\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/2pmnaewa</a>\n\nThe coats the medical students put on are “short”. They continue to wear these short coats throughout med school and the PG-Y 1 “internship”. After that year they become “residents” and usually are allowed to change to “long” white coats. It’s a way for the savvy to recognize on sight inexperienced, likely less knowledgeable colleagues. In this particular TV ad the pharmacist comes out in a short coat which looks so silly for any medical professional watching.\nA real hoot, IMHO.\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2ezzvh7e\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/2ezzvh7e</a>","createDate":"1715571413","updateDate":"1715621147","approveDate":"1715571416","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133163388,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rob","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133164147","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9527350068092346}

Generally it is a partially completed puzzle still in play.\n\nThen I restart it on my browser from the game start page and filll in what's missing.

Although it was a breeze of ease, it was somehow tasty all the same. I mean even before the theme, it was just somehow fluid... some Monday puzzles somehow satisfy despite not having \"difficulty\", and this was like that. Like one of those pleasant tunes that's simple but somehow puts your mind at ease, as you nod with pleasure at its almost Taoist 'yes'ness. Plus a few little morsels, tidbits of whimsical crunch, like \"Addictive thing in one's pocket\" (PHONE), \"Site for skeletons\" (CLOSET), a cute PuzzPair as Lewis would call it of AQUA and AQUI (and ACOW?), and this is all even before counting the theme!\n\nFor some reason my app didn't do the animation, which I didn't realize it was s'posed to do, but I supplied the sound effects: as I looked for the O's I went \"deedle-deedle-leedle-leedle-deedle-deedle-deedle leedle-deedle-deedle-dooooo\" as my finger traced its path.\n\nIt's lovely to have a light meal like a Monday puzzle be so delectable.
