Grammys are given early in the year, for the music from the year just ended. So the 1989 awards, also referred to as the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards, awarded artists for music of 1988, (This is similar to the Super Bowl using Roman numerals, since it serves to crown the previous year’s champions.)\n\nSome sources, such as Wikipedia, calls KT OSLIN’s award the 1988 award, while the list on Google’s search page calls it the 1989 award. The Grammys just call it the award given at the 32nd annual awards. \n\nBut the NYT always uses the year of the work, not the award, for the Grammys, Oscars, and other awards. Maybe they shouldn’t, but at least it’s consistent. (They could say, for example, [Artist who won a Best Country Song Grammy for a 1988 hit]. But they don’t.)","createDate":"1764387566","updateDate":"1764447854","approveDate":"1764387566","recommendations":25,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146942491,"parentUserDisplayName":"Caroline","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146942571","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8848389983177185}

Lucek may be large already but he's not an adult by any means. He's still growing rapidly, and he is not se×uaIIy mature. He doesn't yet raise his leg to pee. Other, older dogs recognize this, tolerating much more from him than they would from a mature dog. In general, larger breeds don't reach maturity until they're 2 years old or so, smaller ones get there faster.\n\nOf course, Americans often use \"puppy\" to describe a dog of any age. The Polish \"szczeniak\" only ever works for young dogs, and that usage influences my English, too - I would never call an adult dog a puppy.","createDate":"1764409493","updateDate":"1764464366","approveDate":"1764409495","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146943522,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146943600","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6101977825164795}

Then there’s Andrzej’s sommelier nit—sure a sommelier could offer a HOUSE WINE, but you wouldn’t usually use a sommelier for it and it’s an amusing and interesting observation—even Andrzej might admit (in his heart if not here) it’s not absolutely incorrect but could have been clued in a better way, and I enjoyed the discussion.

I was able to figure out the first clue in this puzzle but it’s still “doesn’t make sense” in that it doesn’t hang together grammatically and conceptually in a satisfying way to me. Same for a lot of the other clues. Sometimes this comment section has a toxic positivity vibe, if anyone doesn’t like the puzzle they’re piled on for being negative.","createDate":"1764471597","updateDate":"1764475840","approveDate":"1764471598","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146952590,"parentUserDisplayName":"Darren","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146953642","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-29","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6653562188148499}
