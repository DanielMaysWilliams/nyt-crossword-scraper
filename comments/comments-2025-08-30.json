(Because they'd almost surely eventually get them.)\n\n(On occasion,  \"muddling\" for me includes running the alphabet for a letter or two and so some of my solves would not be gold stars if I were a paper solver!!) \n\nIt's fun to ponder...\nCould be they are just busy in life and don't actually have the time; could be that they prefer to get it done in one sitting; could be that they know they have an error somewhere but trying to find it is too tedious.\n\nI am slow for sure but quite stubborn/patient about correctly finishing a puzzle if at all possible. \n\nThe AHA!!!! feeling of waking up or thinking of the answer when walking or doing something else is my 100% favorite part of puzzling so I think I kind of prefer the ones that take me forever.\n\nMy streak is never very long (I'm at like 48 or something) but that's nearly always because life got in the way and I got behind and missed the time window because I didn't even start the puzzle (which is about 3 days.)\n\nI eventually solve it cleanly but that gives a blue star. Oh well! \n\nIn fact, I can look back at the calendar and the blue stars perfectly correlate to stressful or busy periods 😬😬😬.\n\nAlways love participating in these thought-provoking discussions in this amazing community. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","createDate":"1756548951","updateDate":"1756599789","approveDate":"1756548952","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144645221,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steven M.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144646487","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6606255769729614}

He thought that was as good a guess as any, since he had never heard of the actual answer. But the clue was [Another name for ESPN8, with \"the\"], which has a very big hint buried in it.\n\nI’ve never heard of ESPN8, even though I have the full sports package on my TV, but I caught the 8 in the clue.  That led me to a Spanish number, which went in immediately (maybe even before ORS).\n\nBeing able to take advantage of built-in hints like that one is what gives you confidence.
