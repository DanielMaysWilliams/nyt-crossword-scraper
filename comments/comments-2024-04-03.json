I love how three of the theme answers rhyme – it’s a shame there wasn’t a theme answer that could end in “ease” or “seize”.\n\nMy brain let out a big “Huh!” at learning the concrete fact.  It also keeps reparsing DARK ALES as DARK ALLEYS.  \n\nI can’t believe TREE RING has never appeared before today in a NYT crossword!  (It has elsewhere, once clued \"Circle of life?\")  \n\nAlso, I love the misdirecting clue – [Not fantastic], for REAL – which had me thinking along the line of SO SO.  And, in the GRUB category we have RIB, PURPLE PEAS, OAT, LEG, OREO, EGGS and FILETS.\n\nAlex, there was much I liked about your puzzle, but your theme is what sealed the deal.
