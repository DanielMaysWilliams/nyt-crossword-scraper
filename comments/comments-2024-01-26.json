Heath, formerly Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. 'The expression obviously refers to the sport of hawking. Most birds, especially one of heavy flight like the heron, when roused by the falconer or his dog, would fly down or with the wind, in order to escape. When the wind is from the north, the heron flies towards the south, and the spectator may be dazzled by the sun, and be unable to distinguish the hawk from the heron. On the other hand, when the wind is southerly, the heron flies towards the north, and it and the pursuing hawk are clearly seen by the sportsman, who then has his back to the sun, and without difficulty knows the hawk from the hernsew. A curious reader may further observe that a wind from the precise point north-north-west would be in the eye of the sun at half-past ten in the forenoon, a likely time for hawking, whereas \"southerly\" includes a wider range of wind for a good view.\"","createDate":"1706336885","updateDate":"1706338279","approveDate":"1706336887","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130744954,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rob Richards","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130747641","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.49696028232574463}

It's a HUGE stretch to refer to WoW as an 'RPG' rather than an MMO. \n\nI did also say I was being kind of overly fussy with it, but when mentioning WoW and FF together nowadays, it's generally in the context of them both being MMORPGs. Like, 'what do these games have in common'.\n\nIf the point was to actually talk about RPGs, going 'Baldurs Gate and Final Fantasy' or even 'Fallout and Final Fantasy' (even if Fallout has mobile games, or other types of things), or Dark Souls and Fallout, etc. all would have been much more accurate in my opinion.","createDate":"1706252486","updateDate":"1706291178","approveDate":"1706252490","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130721564,"parentUserDisplayName":"Evan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130721592","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6429761052131653}
