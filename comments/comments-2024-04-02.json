Unfortunately the matchup with Angel Reese was marred by an ankle injury that hobbled her, just after she had almost singlehandedly put the Tigers in the lead early in the game.

Just one example – ODE, which early in the week may be clued with [Poem of adoration], or [“___ to Billy Joe], or something similar, but today is clued [One might be Horatian].  I had to stop for an instant – but what a sweet instant – to connect that clue to my knowledge base.\n\nThis happened enough to elevate this puzzle for me from routine to sweet.  I’ve loved Billy’s  witty cluing in his themeless puzzles, and even though the clues are dialed down for this early-week puzzle, they were made with care and intelligence. Today's cluing wasn't a collection of retreads.  Bravo, sir! \n\nBTW, if anyone’s solving time is a touch longer than usual, it could be because we were given an extra column to solve.  \n\nSome lovely serendipities today.  The clue to the last answer being [Checks out].  The fam feel, with DAD, KIN, and NANA.  A backward ETTAL to echo ET AL.\n\nAnother plus: Three of the four theme answers (all except MAYO CLINIC) are NYT answer debuts, giving the puzzle pop.\n\nBB, thank you for such a high-quality and enjoyable session in the box today.

You see, here in the States, the day before Black Friday is a little holiday we call Thanksgiving, when everyone except those in critical infrastructure jobs like hospital and emergency workers are off.  Many businesses, including schools and a lot of offices, give their workers the next day off as well because people like to travel for Thanksgiving, and even if they don't, they like to gorge themselves and not worry about work the next day.\n\nSo with Friday a semi-holiday already, Black Friday developed organically as the \"first official shopping day of the Christmas season\" before anything was planned for the day.  That couldn't happen anywhere else because everywhere else, that day is a regular work day.\n\nWith the rise of e-commerce, Black Friday isn't the thing it was in the States just a few year ago, anyway.
