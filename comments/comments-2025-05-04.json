Ohh, the memories… We were once the humans who belonged to a very special Rhody/Rottie mix. \n\nI’ve read that, if you’re a dog person, you will love all the dogs to which you’ll belong in your life.

Then, of the three I had when I met my husband, although I loved all of them equally fiercely, my Rhody/Rottie was my second “that dog.” My husband used to say that if she’d been born a person (and if you asked her, she *had* been), she would’ve been me, and had I been a dog, I would have been her. We were two of a kind. \n\nAfter she left us, followed within a year by our other two dogs, I thought I couldn’t do the happiness-always-ends-in-such-pain cycle again. But then The Dog found us, and she turned out to be one of those special dogs again. Incidentally, The Dog, the New Mexico desert product that she was, had a horror of KUDZU.

Also really enjoyed the nice long nap I took between the Saturday and Sunday puzzles. It's been a puzzling, but thoroughly unproductive, day.\n\nGreat theme! Didn't take much to fill in the revealer but it ELICITed much gladness! And, importantly, it explained the little issues I was having throughout the grid. I suspected a rebus but I tend to fill around and be patient until I uncover enough. It was a delight. \n\nOnly wish I'd figured out the part about the rebus squares spelling STARWARS myself. I found out thanks to Avi in NYC mentioning it below. Definitely increased my enjoyment and respect for the puzzle. So glad we didn't have to wait until 2031. \n\nNote to self: slow down to review the puzzle better once complete, especially when there are fun tricks. \n\nBLOWUPDOLL! Ha!! I highly recommend the movie \"Lars and the Real Girl,\" if you have watched it.

(And to the Star Wars haters, sorry guys. It's our time to shine.)\n\nI LOVED this puzzle, even without noticing the added bonus of the SU squares spelling out Star Wars, which I learned of in the comments here. I should have suspected there was more to it when I noticed there were two SUs, two AUs, and two RUs, but it didn't occur to me to check. \n\nGINSU KNIFE told me right away there were rebuses, and LETTUCE WRAPS confirmed that the rebuses would be letters followed by U, so I didn't need the revealer to solve the puzzle, but it sure was a delightful discovery.\n\nI miss going to movies at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and hearing the Mighty WURLITZER played before the show. \n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bqw7Wgk4nQ4?si=-VkLBY6CZFLtk1Uy\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/Bqw7Wgk4nQ4?si=-VkLBY6CZFLtk1Uy</a>\n\nThis puzzle has quite a few entries I didn't know, but its brilliance is that all of them except one filled in easily from crosses. (The only remaining square where I had to run the alphabet at the end was the cross of SDSU and DNA, but I think if I had taken time to mull it over, I could have gotten DNA without knowing the song just because it's logical.) \n\nI mean seriously, if you didn't know VITRUVIAN MAN but could get it 100% from crosses, that's good construction in my book. YMMV.\n\nAnd now I have \"Closing Time\" stuck in my head even though I didn't remember the name of the band, and now that I see it, I'm not sure I ever knew it, but that song was ubiquitous in 1998.","createDate":"1746332010","updateDate":"1746427600","approveDate":"1746332012","recommendations":18,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141891935","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9246430993080139}

Looked at the puzzle's date, and was off to the races.\n\nNow, I know virtually nothing about Star Wars. Never saw the movie. Or maybe I did and was stoned in those days. Really, the only things I know about it, namely the names, I learned from the puzzles. \n\nBut GINSU KNIVES jumped out right away, so it was fairly easy to figure out the rest of the answers, with a few exceptions: LETTUCE WRAPS, for instance. Easy to deduce, but why cookout food? I've only had them in restaurants, where they're usually appetizers.\n\nThe trick was straightforward, the sports-related answers annoying, and there were too many of them.

The movie was a big hit, and made Lucas the money to do his real dream -- Star Wars.\n\nSuzanne Summers, in her first 'real' movie role, drove that little white 1956 Thunderbird that had Richard Dreyfus drooling after her.  He was also an unknown.  I think the only known actor in the movie was Ron Howard.  So many others got their start in American Graffitti, including Harrison Ford.\n\nI'm partial to that movie because I own a duplicate 1956 TBIRD that my dad bought knew.  I've had it since 1980.

They were both in high school and got non-paying jobs as extras, just for fun.

The vet back home had guessed “10 years, could be more” when El Señor picked us as his new humans. So now each month that his good health is reaffirmed is a gift. Our new vet here administers Solensia every 4 weeks without a peep of protest from the kitty, then he runs his large, capable hands over the little body with the slow touch of someone who knows animals in a way he doesn’t know—or care to know—people. I already trust this man as much as I’ve ever trusted any of our animals’ doctors. He says little; he makes even less eye contact with us.

Thank you for this. The first time I heard Tom Waits was sometime in 1976. I was living in Seattle, where a friend and I had moved after college because it was 2000 miles from the small coal mining town where we’d lived. I didn’t have a car…I didn’t need one, being in Seattle with its mass transit, and with my living two miles from the bank where I’d gotten a job, I often walked. I had no interest in banking, but was drawn to it because T S Eliot had been a banker and I thought I was a poet. \n\nOne day, a senior VP needed some documents run to one of our branches and asked if I’d take them. When I said I didn’t have a car, he gave me the keys to his…I forget the make, but it was a small, silver sports car of some kind. It was a stick shift and while I’d learned on a car with a manual transmission, I’d not driven one in a few years…and I’d certainly never driven one in Seattle, with its hills. At every stop light I was struck with near panic that I’d get my timing with the clutch wrong, stall out and roll back into the car behind me, wrecking my boss’s boss’s very expensive car.\n\nIt wasn’t the smoothest drive but I did get to the branch without incident, and as I pulled into the parking spot at the curb, Tom Waits’ “Step Right Up” came on the radio. I’d never heard anything like it, so I sat there, transfixed until it was over. The next time I was in a record store, I bought the album, then another, and I’ve been a fan since.\n\nSo, thank you for sharing this.","createDate":"1746364449","updateDate":"1746402323","approveDate":"1746364450","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141892990,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy J.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141895007","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5763124823570251}
