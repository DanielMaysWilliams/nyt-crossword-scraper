I find the concept of cheating on the NYTimes puzzles to be weird.  Why do you work the puzzles?  Is it some sort of self affirmation that you have the brains and breadth of knowledge to do them? that you are trying to keep your mind clicking away to avoid getting rusty? that you are hoping to prove yourself superior to other solvers,? or are you simply enjoying a diversion? Whatever the reason, \"cheating\" cannot be cheating if there's no one to cheat. Cheating implies that there will be some advantage to be gained by doing it, and there isn't any here.  The whole concept is ridiculous.\n\nI  set a standard for myself in the Bee never to try to find words except those in my own memory, or that can be made using prefixes or suffixes to devise some I don't actually know, and I do google sometimes for spelling. Otherwise, I'm on my own, because at my age I can't afford to lose any ground.  The words are there, and the challenge is to find them. But for the crosswords, I enjoy researching clues for answers, learning new things, and I have never considered it \"cheating.\"  \n\nIt would be sad to think that we are here trying to fight it out to prove who is the smartest kid on the block.

I knew that the Lion part was almost accidental, since they changed their signage and it was cheap to change the original letters around.  However, I could have sworn that (a) the original name was Food Land and that (b) they changed it as a direct result of the embarrassing ABC report that they used bleach to resell old rotted meat.  What Los Wikipedias are telling me is that (a) the original name was Food Town and (b) they changed it before that report and (c) ABC's report may, or may not have been fraudulent.  But since the primary source they link on the \"innocent\" side is a harsh and particularly axe grindey screed at \"Accuracy in Media\" I think it's safe to continue to think of Food Lion as the Bleached Meat company, after all.\n\n\n____________________\nJesse Goldberg 8/28/2024 for Puzzle of the Decade\n(emu filler)","createDate":"1734485305","updateDate":"1734493139","approveDate":"1734485309","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138345345,"parentUserDisplayName":"Esmerelda","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138364509","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-17","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5150827765464783}
