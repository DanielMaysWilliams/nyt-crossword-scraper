It makes me think of people I know where English isn't their first language, and they say English is confusing - I agree, and this proves it entirely!\n\nUnfortunately I couldn't finish this one due to a few clues I was completely stumped on. I wasn't familiar with \"On the LAM\", AFLAC, ASSAY or ATF. LEA and FEN caught me out as well. BOSC was unfamiliar to me, too.\n\nHowever, I can't really fault this puzzle otherwise; there will always be American-centric clues that I won't get from time to time, as well as things I'm unfamiliar with, no matter how much prep I do. It was a lovely fill for the most part - ISLE, MOUSIER, AVE, MENDACIOUS, NEHRU, SAMOA, FAME, and LIEU were all lovely.

So I have a soft spot for at least the idea of their LIGHT OPERAs.

Act II opens with a song called \"Please, Hello\" where the Americans return, followed by several other nations. The music matches the nations: the American sounds like a Sousa march, the French sounds vaguely can-can-esque, the Russian is in a minor key, and the British is a pitch-perfect pastiche of a G&S patter song. And each of them is accompanied by the not-so-subtle hint of a warship.\n\nthe American (and to a lesser degree the Russian and Dutch) speak with poor grammar, as they would be trying to speak Japanese. This video is from the original Bway production in 1976. I've cued it up just before the Brit sings, but you can watch the whole thing if you want. ;)\n\nbtw the Dutchman blithely uses a derogatory term, and I thought of this song every time that term [cued differently of course] showed up in the grid and subsequently in the comments.

But since the G is only pronounced that way before E and I, even within the same verb, the letters may switch off:  usted elige (you choose) vs. elija usted (choose!--imperative).\n\nThe H is silent, and there's no good way to know when to put it.\n\nThe soft C and Z are pronounced the same way, and in Latin American, the S is also pronounced like the other two.  Verb confusion exists similar to that of G and J:  usted alza (you raise); alce usted (raise!--imperative).\n\nB and V have two different sounds, but not one for each letter.  One for initial position and one for intervocalic (somewhat simplified).  However, what's clear is that this occurs for both letters, and the letters are called B grande and V chica to distinguish them.\n\nK is a rare letter, but when it is used, it sounds identical to hard C. QU also has a simple hard C sound.  More verb confusion: usted saca--you take out; saque usted--take out! (imperative).\n\nIn some countries, LL sounds like Y.\n\nLuckily, vowels are quite consistent, and cause few problems.  But Spanish spelling, while easier than English spelling, is not automatic.
