Too much even to summarize--at one point, between OED, M-W, and Wikipedia, I had six tabs open. One take-away--the (British) Parliamentary Margarine Act of 1887, with a legal mandate of the term \"margarine,\"  over \"oleo(margarine)\" or \"butterine\". Not to be confused with the (American) Congressional Margarine Act of 1886, which tried (unsuccessfully) to ban its production and sale entirely. Neither, however, addressed the \"g\" controversy.. Also, the OED lists a verb form, \"(to) margarine,\" which is what Frank's Diner does to my toast, too liberally for my taste, unless I tell them not to.

It was dubbed in German, with a another guy talking over all the lines in Polish.\n\nThere was no legal market for VHS tapes back then, so all the tapes were bootlegs, usually copied from originals acquired in Germany and smuggled across the border. The practice was not illegal per se, as Poland introduced Wester-style copyright laws only in 1994, 5 years after the fall of \"communism\".\n\nThe copying underground was well organized - few people spoke German, so the bootleggers hired translators, and then a voice actor to recite the lines, which were added to the sound mix over the original dialog.\n\nBTW, in Poland on modern TV, foreign films are neither subtitled nor dubbed - much like in the bootleg VHS days, a single voice actor recites lines in Polish with the original dialog still audible in the background. It is very weird, and one of the many reasons (the other being commercial breaks) I never watch traditional TV. Dubbing is reserved for childrens' movies (on TV and in cinemas), and subtitles for cinematic releases.

Fun puzzle overall but that threw me for a loop! \n\nMy mind went to this: \nDon’t repeat words in your clues that appear in the grid\nIt can feel like a spoiler, seeing a word on the clue side of the page and later having to fill that same word into the grid.
