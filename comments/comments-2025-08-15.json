I solved it in half of my average time with no hangups other than starting with Maggie at 2A, a fantastic misdirect considering how often the Simpsons TV show shows up in the puzzles, and art at 35A. Once no crosses would work, that was easily remediable. \n\nIt was really a fun one though! Lots of great clues! My favorite, being a big Agatha Christie fan, was CORPSE, which, being a big fan, I put it on the first round and was so delighted that it was correct!! \n\nAlso really enjoyed GERMAN for schadenfreude! I have to admit that I had a sense of schadenfreude this week. I feel bad about it because I typically really want the best for everyone, and care about others woes, but there might be one or two exceptions. Ugh, you've all lost respect for me now, I know it! \n\nBut it's hard to not feel it a little bit of it when the person who brutally eliminated you from your very long time position as an advocate for taking a moral high ground and refusing to do something illegal for the benefit of the company, is eliminated from her position a few years later. Still, I wish I had no inclination at all for schotten freitas... ha! \n\nStupid voice to text, I'm not even going to bother to RETYPE it... 😆  Just have to teach my voice to text to speak GERMAN, I guess. 🤣  Oh well, perhaps tomorrow I will be a perfect person.

The lack of quotes indicates we're NOT substituting an equivalent utterance as we would if the quotes were present. That is, [\"My word!\"] solves to EGAD most often, but without quotes it changes the meaning of the clue.\n\nBut how, exactly? I struggled to remember other examples of this because they don't show up that often. I tried typing some on xword info and I got [Beat it!] as a clue for EGG and also for DRUM, whereas the quoted version [\"Beat it!] solved to SCRAM or GETLOST, which I think illustrates the difference nicely: generally the pattern is that removing the quotes makes the clue point to a literal object of the phrase rather than a substitute idiomatic expression, which would make today's clue a little unusual because it relies on the well known phrase \"my word is my bond\" to make the substitution rather than just a simple literal reading. (Often I have this experience with solving this type of clue, that the answer seems linked more by vibes than by the strict grammatical evaluation that we can apply to other clue types.)\n\nDo people think I characterized this correctly?

I think a more legitimate argument is if you couldn’t use a word in the abbreviation spelled out in the crossword (for example I couldn’t post it here right now) then how do you justify including it in abbreviated form? It just seems a little hypocritical, either it’s allowed or it isn’t. But otherwise I don’t mind, it’s not really offensive as clued and I don’t  think it’s going to single handedly drive our youth or our language down a path of depravity or lasciviousness.","createDate":"1755262419","updateDate":"1755313916","approveDate":"1755262420","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144296892,"parentUserDisplayName":"jennie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144299087","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5484674572944641}
