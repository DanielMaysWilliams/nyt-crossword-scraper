Poland is notorious for the cars on its roads being old and poorly maintained. The statistics are imperfect, because many people don't bother to notify the authorities when they scrap an auto but still, the average age of a car here is 18 years, and all parking lots are dotted all over with oil stains.\n\nThere was a time when a million old cars were imported into the country from the West per year. Many of them were written off as totaled in Germany. It was illegal to repair those wrecks over there, but unscrupulous Polish mechanics didn't care - they Frankensteined them back to life, or rather, undeath - and equally unscrupulous used car dealers sold them on, keeping the vehicles' history a secret. My ex's brother unwittingly bought such a Honda once. It cracked in half in a light collision. Only then did it turn out the front and back ends had come from two different wrecks that had been welded together...\n\nThings are slowly improving now as prosperity increases, but it will be decades before our roads are rid of those deathtraps.","createDate":"1759809505","updateDate":"1759893838","approveDate":"1759809505","recommendations":30,"replyCount":15,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145771915","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4092895984649658}

This is not the puzzle I’d have thought my streak would succumb to, but (as a non-native speaker who started speaking English well into high school) the NW corner bested me.

DAY?? I couldn’t imagine Icarus spent more than a few minutes in it, with how close to it he got!). In retrospect, I should have easily picked up GILDS — then, I could have inferred LOVE and probably cinched this thing. \n\nBut listen, rambling aside, my educational deficiencies aren’t the puzzle’s fault.

What is \"common\" knowledge varies greatly depending on age, gender, region and background. In this context though, I'm generally referring to proper nouns, answers that can't be solved through knowledge of word structure. \n\nFor example, I did not know the word APSES until today. However, I was able to solve it because I knew how to make a plural of a word ending in s. Contrast to TEVYE, a proper noun I have never encountered. Unless I solved it entirely through crosses (which I could not), there was simply no way for me to progress.\n\nPart of the joy of crosswords for me is word structure, and proper nouns just don't follow the same structural rules. There's no satisfying way to solve for a proper noun, to get a eureka moment where a hidden phrase all becomes clear. Either you know the trivia and get it instantly or you don't and must rely on crosses. I find that unsatisfying.\n\nI have no idea about crosswords before I was born. I'm sure they had trivia back then too, and never meant to imply there had been a change over time.

So some people refer to this room as a TV room. But if the electronics get too fancy, it can be called a media room, which is more like a home theater, which is to say it is purpose-built. \n\nA den is just another name for a family room.","createDate":"1759833436","updateDate":"1759849532","approveDate":"1759833438","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145773378,"parentUserDisplayName":"Seb","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145773724","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8511267304420471}

Many families had a \"front room\" near the front entrance, which was kept immaculate, with the best furniture and china ornaments etc and it was only for sitting with visitors, even if you hardly ever had visitors. Maybe used for a birthday or at Christmas.\n\nThe fire was only lit when there were visitors, (when every room had a coal fire) and so it was usually freezing cold.\n\nCrofter cottages used to be 2 rooms, called the \"but and ben\", where \"but\" was the kitchen area and \"ben\" a sitting room. When I was a child, people would still say \"Come ben the hoose\" or \"Come ben\" even when living in a more modern house or flat.

Puccini saw the play, wrote the opera, and debuted it in 1898, when it flopped. He re-wrote it and that version premiered in 1904 and was a hit, and has continued to be a hit. Since he was Italian, and the libretto is in Italian, he named the opera in Italian: MADAMA Butterfly. It has spawned plays, musicals, and movies.","createDate":"1759888655","updateDate":"1759925025","approveDate":"1759888655","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145794629,"parentUserDisplayName":"Coco Amar","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145795991","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7538168430328369}
