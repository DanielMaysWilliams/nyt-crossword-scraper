I understood the theme immediately, so the use of top/side/bottom in clues wasn’t a misdirect.

I only had LEVITATE and VAL locked down. The hat synonym somehow eluded me (was there a type of hat starting with L I didn’t know about?), and surrounding context words were French (a word I clearly should know from crosswordese, but am never confident in), a vaguely familiar name (my brain said bELLA), and a play on words (anAL retentive?).

He took two Greek roots, ὀκτώ (oktṓ, eight) and πούς (poús, foot), and mashed them into a pseudo-Latin singular. \n\nThis is something Linnaeus did: He Latinized Greek forms without strictly following classical declension patterns. So ‘octopus’ looks like a Latin second-declension masculine noun, but it wasn’t borrowed with declension rules in mind.\n\nThere is no ‘octopus’ in classical Latin texts. It was known as ‘polypus’ in the ancient world and, yes, it was a second-declension masculine noun, thus taking the plural of ‘polypi.’ (Pliny mentions it in that form.)\n\nSo, technically—grammatically—as a (somewhat) freshly Latinized Greek word, ‘octopus’ should be pluralized as ‘octopodes,’ which is why when the OED issued its 1st edition, they was the preferred form. Since then, however, most people have used ‘octopi’ taking their cue from ‘polypus’/‘polypi,’ and the new editions take their cue from usage. As fewer people study Latin and Greek now, fewer people are horrified by a Greek borrowing being declined as ‘octopi.’\n\nIf you are horrified by ‘octopi’ (I am), stay on the safe side and call them ‘octopuses.’ After its quarter of a millennium in English, ‘octopus’ has earned an English plural.","createDate":"1752033135","updateDate":"1752111227","approveDate":"1752033136","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143396186,"parentUserDisplayName":"Patrick J.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143396761","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8848084807395935}

And it's also a way to get alums back to the school.
