Respect, Francis's mother!\n\nMy mother had it easy. Her father was a party bigwig - his driver in a black, Soviet limo would drive her to summer camp.

I have no idea how she managed to be as down-to-earth as she was, having experienced such privilege. She never looked down on people, and treated everybody as an equal. I never got to know her father - he died before I was born. He must have taught her well, I suppose. It sure as hell wasn't her mother - a haughty, cold, fakely polite woman who fancied herself an intellectual despite lacking any intelligence, who never did anything nice or smart in her life (as a child I was so envious of everybody's grandmothers - mine was so different, and so much worse!)\n\n@NYC Traveler \n\nThank you for the sentiment.

In a typical crossword, the longest answers are Across, and the Down answers are often shorter (so fewer options).  The shorter answers aren't the \"marquee\" answers, so their clues are often more straightforward as well.\n\nBut I understand where you're coming from.  This puzzle in particular has a LOT of \"crosswordese\": REO, GOL, ESSIE, OPI, ECO, etc, which are much more common in crosswords than in real life.  Now, when I see \"Nail polish (3 letters),\" I know it's OPI, but it took a long time to get there!

I find test difficulty and puzzle difficulty to be related.\n\nTest difficulty is based on the individuals taking the test and their level of the knowledge/ability being assessed, unless you get into some of the more advanced statistical techniques, but those require a very large sample in order to assess \"true\" difficulty. \n\nI see xword puzzles in the same way. Each of us has areas we know, areas we are aware of, areas we have vague memories about, etc. and they differ from person to person.\n\nWe don't have a large sample with known measures that we can use to assess the true difficulty of any given puzzle.\n\nIf a lot of the NYT solvers know Broadway shows, then puzzles that use those for some of the long entries will appear to be easier. But change the sample to a group that knows little if anything about B'way shows, and the puzzles will appear to be more difficult.\n\nWe talk about wheelhouses here, and I think that explains a lot of this.\n\nMaybe an experienced solver here has an idea of what the overall group tends to know and not know, but if the make up of the group changes, then their guesses/estimates will suffer.","createDate":"1748653779","updateDate":"1748692487","approveDate":"1748653779","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142496270,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bill in Yokohama","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142497096","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6340371370315552}
