Not all words are pluralized with an S (remember LIRE from the other day's Mini?), and not all plural clues result in an answer in plural form.  Only the sense has to match.  [Odds] has been used to clue RATIO, for example, and [Brains] has been used to clue SENSE and GRAY MATTER.  [Lots] clues A TON as well as TONS, among others. \n\nYes, 99% of the time, there will be an S at the end, but the 1% that it doesn't can bring you to a crashing halt.  \n\nAt least be ready and willing to put it if it's not helping.  And having just one letter isn't usually that helpful, anyway.\n\nA corollary of this is not to think an answer is wrong immediately if it starts or ends with a combination of letters that don't play well together.  Sometimes they're initials or abbreviations.  For example, if you had GS--- for an entry on Sunday, you might have thought it couldn't be possible.  But it turned out it was possible.  It was G SPOT.  This kind of thing happens all the time.  If you had --NDB on Tuesday, you weren't wrong, either,  It was R AND B.\n\nSome unsolicited advice for possible newbs (or is it noobs?) who might find it helpful.","createDate":"1734061611","updateDate":"1734123412","approveDate":"1734061614","recommendations":19,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138258560","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6226514577865601}

I would prefer lots, but that's just me.\n\nJust don't use that vegan cheez.\n\nYou know what else is usually baked? FLAN! Typically custard mixture poured into a caramel-lined mold, then baked in a water bath. Then chilled, and unmolded. There's also the British flans, in which the custard is baked directly in a pastry crust, like a sweet quiche (savory ones exist, too). Now there's also the \"fruit flan\"--which is a thinnish pre-baked tart shell, into which pastry cream is put, then topped with fruit, and usually a clear shiny glaze. The pastry cream might be made over a double-boiler, I guess, but usually I'll do it over gentle direct heat.\n\nOf course there are those creepy instant flan mixes, full of weird thickeners and stabilizers like carrageenan or xanthan gum (so creepy, even spell-check doesn't recognize them), which they've probably been using at the hotel while I've been on leave. I shudder to think.

As expected (as the only criterion for these awards is chart position), Taylor Swift took, as they apparently say, the lion's share of the major awards, on the eve of her 35th birthday.\n\nThe notion that rap is the world's most popular music (as mentioned recently) did not seem to be confirmed, at least from what I saw.  Of course, awards shows like this are tailored (or even Taylored) to the local audience.\n\nAs a result, there were several country artists there, too.  The biggest single of the year was a country song, A Bar Song (Tipsy), by Shaboozey, which is also notable because he is a Black country artist.  The sudden success of him and several other Black country artists in the last few years may or may not have been thanks to the efforts of Beyonce, who may or may not have recorded a country album on which Shaboozey and several other Black country artists appeared.\n\nThankfully, A Bar Song is a lot more fun than ALONE AGAIN.","createDate":"1734060475","updateDate":"1734142039","approveDate":"1734060479","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138258170,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138258337","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5945676565170288}

Although water-baths, bain-maries (bains-marie?), and double-boilers all use hot water to gentle the heating process--pace Wikipedia, and Amazon--there are some differences.\n\nA water-bath is used in an oven, to temper the heat, but also to provide humidity in the oven, so the flan or cheesecake or whatever doesn't dry out. A bain-marie and a double boiler are more similar, except one wouldn't normally *cook*  on a bain-marie, except in unusual situations. It's generally reserved for reheating food, or keeping it warm. Unless the bain-marie is turned too high, in which case your hotel pan of baked ziti might get all over-cooked and dried out on the bottom. Btw, I looked up the \"flan double-boilers\" on Amazon--what a total gimmicky waste of money and kitchen counter space!\n\nAnd let's not even bring up sous-vide!\n\nIt is interesting to think that bain-maries had their origins as alchemical equipment.\n\n@RPS--flans aside, a fun puzzle, though! \n\n@CQ--we spent an hour this morning at the Belle Isle Aquarium: it gets better every time we go. Mostly freshwater tanks, but some salt: Starfish, brittle stars, sea anemones, crinoids (or somethings very crinoidy, at least.)
