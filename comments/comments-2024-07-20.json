The revealer was TO BE FAIR, meant to be read aloud.  Hah!\n\nToday, the play abounded in the clues.  I marked eight wordplay clues that struck my fancy – eight! – such as the stellar question mark clues [Beat poet?] for RAPPER, and [Horses around?] for CAROUSEL.\n\nThis was a TWO SPEED solve for me.  Most of it was fairly steady, but with enough delicious resistance to keep me well engaged. But then there was one area like a block of ice that I had to keep chipping away at, where I kept coming back with futile results, where it laughed at and mocked me for my incompetence, until finally, finally, I cracked it open, happy and grateful. \n\nThree reactions.  First, much to my amazement, BUCKET LIST has never appeared before in the NYT puzzle!  Second, the black squares dominating the center of the grid look like a giant S, and even though it’s backward, I couldn’t help but think of Superman.

I have to thank a grad school classmate, who did her thesis project around the Hangul writing system -- plus I already had the COREYS, because duh! At some point in the 90's you couldn't escape them in movies and tabloids. I also had the ON ICE part of 16A, even if at midnight last night I couldn't remember the intro-! \n\nAnd then wow, some extra level (black diamond) cluing throughout! Looking back up from the bottom of the run, answers like UNTOLD, IN HOT WATER and OVERDONE seem so straightforward -- but I know there was some steep terrain there! Loved the clues for NAPE and ROSS and of course CAROUSEL. Love being able to figure out ASTROS from a little bit of MLB knowledge + a close reading of the clue.
