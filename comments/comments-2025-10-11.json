It‚Äôs more about a statistical convergence, if you will. Today, for example, I started off reading the down clues first because the spanners across were unlikely to yield early answers. TOM was a gimme, but it didn‚Äôt help with the acrosses. SCROD is usually the 5-letter answer for anything swimming off the coast of New England and WATT was 70-90% likely to be the engineer in question, but neither elucidated the spanners. But then 11D was likely CRADLE, which crossed the likely DEFECT, which crossed the likely FESTIVAL *and* the likely DIET _ _ _. Taken all together, it‚Äô was statistically a sure-fire cluster that broke the puzzle open. \n\nPro tip (if I may speak as a pro based on having brushfire-burned my way  through the archives): When you get a clue to which you‚Äôre pretty sure you‚Äôve got a likely answer, first check the crosses that hit its consonants, especially ones that are less common in English. In CRADLE, the D is a pretty common letter, so its crossing DEFECT didn‚Äôt prompt me to fill in both. But the possible DEFECT has an F in it, which instantly prompted FESTIVAL, and that F instantly became a solid ‚Äújoint‚Äù for the two entries. \n\nI never just go through the clues from A to Z looking for things I know. I look for footholds for crosses as soon as I *think* I know an answer. \n\nHope that makes sense.
