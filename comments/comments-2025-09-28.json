Polish employees also have up to 33 sick days with 80% of our pay, long maternal and paternal leave, living minimum wage, paid overtime and weekend work, etc. Of course, many employers, especially small businesses, try to game the system, utilizing illegal contractual trickery to deprive employees, usually young ones, of their rights, and the government doesn't have the resources to do much about it üò¢.\n\nI had to look up some proper names to deal with some of the spots in the grid, e.g. SYMS and WESTELM in the trivia-overloaded SE corner.\n\nI don't get the clue for BEHAVES - \"Minds one's P's and Q's\".

One nit to pick: I would argue \"ABLATE\" does not mean to remove surgically. Ablation is killing tissue without removing it, and often non-surgically! Radioablation uses focused radiation beams that converge with sub-millimeter precision to kill aberrant tissue, particularly in the heart to stop arrhythmias. Some people had EXCISE, and I had RESECT until the very end, both of which are more consistent with the clue.","createDate":"1759072865","updateDate":"1759139866","approveDate":"1759072866","recommendations":30,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"8500117749367070","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4791436791419983}

Sometimes I think it‚Äôs like an artist seeing something in another artist‚Äôs painting that other people don‚Äôt see, or a musician hearing the nuances of a virtuoso performance that I couldn‚Äôt appreciate. When I look at this grid, I see someone who first, had six characters that he managed to place symmetrically in the grid (not to mention a long revealer). Then he found six pretty common job benefits and managed to not only fit them symmetrically in the grid as well, but ALSO had to find ones that crossed at EXACTLY the same letter location and shared letters at the crossings. Then find decent fill to fill in around it which is truly not easy with 6 crossing theme entries. So this fill and grid may not be the most pleasant or open but given the constraints it‚Äôs a downright miracle. So for solvers who just care about their own experience I appreciate why they feel that way, it‚Äôs just I tend to get defensive on behalf of the constructor when it‚Äôs phrased as ‚Äúnot interestingly crafted and not clever‚Äù.

Ideally rotational symmetry is preferred but mirror symmetry is allowed when the theme demands it. In this case it allowed for symmetrical placement of the characters and benefits which would not be possible otherwise. Also look at the revealer‚Äîit has 19 letters. So to fit this symmetrically in a rotational grid you would either have to find another 19 letter theme to match it, or stick it in the middle of the grid either vertically or horizontally which would be a huge constraint. So there a plenty of reasons why you might need mirror symmetry to make a puzzle work and the editors allow for it.","createDate":"1759034123","updateDate":"1759102824","approveDate":"1759034125","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":8433051918926657,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"8435119777907505","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7888933420181274}
