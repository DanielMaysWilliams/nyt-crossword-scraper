The trick was that the rebus worked in only one direction; in the other, it acted as a sort of Schrödinger square. Thus HA{ZM}AT SUIT crossed [Wild/bunch] ZANY or MANY and U{S F}LAG crossed [Slumber/party] SIESTA or FIESTA. The 13 squares had all 26 letters.\n\nJuly 6 \"Escape Room\" (Zhou Zhang and Kevin Curry) A memorable central black door with a keyhole you had to fill in with EXIT in order to leave, and a complex group of themed clues and entries that provide sequential hints to allowed you to escape. For example: [Is completely oblivious … or a hint to finding the fourth key letter in this\npuzzle] DOESN’T HAVE A CLUE; [—] TEE, which you can get by the crosses. TEE was the only answer that literally didn’t have a clue and “T” was the last letter to fill in to complete EXIT. 1A also hints at the theme: [Philosopher who wrote \"The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape”] MARX. Standout clue: [It often comes out at night] DENTURE. The intricate mechanics that made it all workable filled one with awe.\n\nMarch 30 \"Mark My Words\" (Simeon Seigel) 7 theme entries had clues that were visual puns consisting of a word or two at the most, accompanied by oddly placed punctuation: [*Composed*] — WRITTEN IN THE STARS (the asterisks standing for stars and \"composed\" a synonym for \"written.\" [Alumnus°] — POSTGRADUATE\nDEGREE.","createDate":"1768540927","updateDate":"1768558274","approveDate":"1768540927","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148109952,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148110647","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8793520331382751}
