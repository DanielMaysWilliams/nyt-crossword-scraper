I didn’t think the puzzle was particularly easy but everything just clicked for me.  My only minor setback was spelling JAKOB with a C instead of a K and briefly wondering if there was a lone rebus to allow me to enter baldfacedlies instead of NAKEDLIES.\n\nA propos of yesterday’s discussion, I did admire the grid design, although I thought at first it might be a trap with two very closed off sections. I mostly worked it counterclockwise from the SE to the SW, with the middle falling into place last.\n\nThere was quite a bit musical span in this puzzle from Georges  BIZET to KATESMITH to Limp Bizkit.  KATESMITH has a special Philadelphia connection because for many years her version of God Bless America was a good luck anthem for the Flyers, and they even erected a statue of her outside the arena.  The club later took down the statue and stopped playing her version of the song when it came to light that she had sung songs with racist lyrics.","createDate":"1736566622","updateDate":"1736653513","approveDate":"1736566626","recommendations":15,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138915091","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8855822682380676}

I thought placing the contralto singer at right angles to the composer of the “Habanera” was apt in a perverse sort of way. Smith’s rich, low-register voice would have been ideal for the part of Carmen, though her body type was all wrong for the role and seduction was hardly her thing. Smith radiated a ma-and-apple-PIE wholesomeness, and her repertoire was as much God and Country as romance. In her day, she was almost as much a patriotic icon as 24D. If you think that popular entertainers have gotten involved in culture-war issues only recently, consider that she campaigned vigorously against releasing the noir film “Double Indemnity” (which apparently boosted its box office).

You'd have to have your head in the ground to not at least be able to recognize the word with a few letters filled in, if not identify the bush, even when not in flower.\n\nOf course, there are people--even some who frequent this forum--who blithely ignore everything around them except that which they have a particular interest in, and then wonder why they're having trouble with the puzzle.  Americans, I mean, not people from other countries who might not have the same experiences Americans are likely to have had.\n\nSo I would give you a break.  Maybe in Poland  you'd have to be deep into horticulture for AZALEA to be a well-known word.  Maybe they plant things there with great frequency that we rarely plant over here.
