On the other hand, the theme sort of left me cold.  I get it; I understand it; it just didn't do very much for me.  Maybe that's just me, but that's how I found it.\n\nMy limited knowledge of Indian words (Hindi, I guess) includes ALOO meaning potato, but does that mean that GOBI means cauliflower?  Then it would be the Cauliflower Desert, wouldn't it?  Lemme look...\n\nApparently, the Hindi word for cauliflower is फूलगोभी\n(phoolagobhee), so maybe a shortened form?\n\nAnd that was about the only non-theme answer of any interest to me in this very workaday puzzle.\n\nAs for the theme, there are literally hundreds of words in English that begin in RE; if those letters show up yellow in Wordle, they go directly at the beginning...unless they go at the end, where they're also extremely common.  The best theme sets are those for which there are hardly any other--or no other--possible examples.  This was the opposite of that.  So what you know after one or two correct answers is that you're going to find an RE in the middle of all of them.\n\nHardly cause for excitement.\n\nSomehow, I expect a more interesting puzzle from Jeff Chen.","createDate":"1739057287","updateDate":"1739135386","approveDate":"1739057289","recommendations":11,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139640340","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4908997714519501}

Today the theme just filled itself in. \n\n24D made me smile because it made me think of the ever incredulous Hastings on the David Suchet version of TV's Poirot.

Usually I'm filled with dread when a puzzle has lots of clues which require knowing the names of any of the actors/public figures, but it didn't hinder me in this one. Appreciate the Kendrick Lamar clue since he's performing at the Super Bowl today!

I was greatly entertained as I uncovered the theme answers.  This was a hoot.\n\nSomething special about those theme answers – six of the seven have never appeared in the 80+ years of the Times puzzle, despite being very in-the-language and having punch. Terrific finds.  Bravo on that, Rich and Jeff!  (Only SPOT REMOVER is not a debut answer).\n\nAnd while more than 18,000 answers that begin with RE have appeared in the NYT puzzle, I found it very hard to come up with quality alternate theme answers, and man, I tried.  Either I thought of a RE word and couldn’t come up with anything, or what I came up with fell flat.\n\nSo, I was not only entertained, but impressed.\n\nThank you, Rich and Jeff, for putting this together, and providing for a lovely gambol in the box today!","createDate":"1739099919","updateDate":"1739172133","approveDate":"1739099922","recommendations":53,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139644141","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-09","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9652950763702393}
