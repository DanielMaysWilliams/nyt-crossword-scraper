I needed to take a break and let my mind reset to deal with the latter.\n\nMost of my entries started out in digital pencil - I was sure of very few things. There were just so many unknowns in the grid for me: LOUISE, New ERA, the Bay of Angels, \"The Fisherman and his flute\", the topic of Yom Kippur, TSQUARE, chakra locations, Rachel REID and \"Heated Rivalry\", Mercury of PHX, NYS, ARLENE, and the Chinese symbol of prosperity.\n\nThen there was stuff that would have stumped me not so long ago, since I only learned about it from NYT puzzles: LOX and IPHOTO.\n\nI had no idea whyd \"Clip-on mic, for short\" solved to LAV. So far in my experience that word has only been clued as a bathroom. However, for once an unknown of mine was covered by the column - quite the surprise!\n\nSo yeah, for me this was a proper Saturday challenge. \n\nI wonder if EXOTICA even exists any more.

Yes! Yes!\n\nI hope solvers who prefer easier puzzles can forgive my excitement. This was the first puzzle in awhile where I couldn't solve it in a straightforward march through the clues with most of my solve occurring in my second pass through the Acrosses. Very predictable. \n\nToday's solve was about as far from predictable as one could get for a themeless.\n\nMy pathway was loopy. I wish I could draw the most fun one because I think it would have formed a rather elegant baroque design. The access I eventually found into my mostly blank NW started from 30D STARTER KIT but did not progress to AESOP at 29A. Instead it veered eastward to 34A and 39A, then northward up to 12D in the far reaches of that quadrant, then back down to 25A, then back up to 21D, and then back down to AESOP. Finally it found its way up into the NW, continuing to switch between downs and acrosses. \n\nI am dizzy.\n\nMy time was several multiples of the mean at XWStats, as it often is, but I enjoyed every moment.","createDate":"1771695882","updateDate":"1771729096","approveDate":"1771695883","recommendations":17,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149055375","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.651470422744751}

A newbie (six months doing puzzles again), I felt proud of myself. I got most of the puzzles, with a little help from google. Yay! \n\nOne clue about the Fisherman and his Flute fable kind of puzzled me a little though. I easily filled in AESOP, but I had never heard of that fable. With a little research, I found out that the story is about a fisherman who tries to get the fish to dance by playing his flute. When they don’t dance, he catches them in his net and tells them: “You see, you refused to dance. And now I will watch you dance as you are succumbing in my net.” \n\nA little gruesome, but to me a little obscure. I’m not sure what the “moral of this story” is. \n\nWikipedia seems to explain it but it’s still not clear.  \n\nThe Fisherman and his Flute - Wikipedia \n\n“In this context the fable is given the political meaning that those who refuse a benefit when it is first offered will gain nothing by acting as asked when constrained to.” \n\nWhat???? \n\nAny English majors around to explain? \n\nBy the way, La Fontaine, very popular in France, also has a version of this story. Five hundred years ago, he was an attorney, but then became a storyteller in the king’s court.
