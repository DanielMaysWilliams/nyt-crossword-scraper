At some point I'll probably go back in time, like in those \"implode the engines for fun and profit\" Star Trek episodes. and when I do I'll be sure to bring back some tasty, choice and extremely affordable cuts of meat and/or produce for everyone.

Some nice entries and clues.\n\nAfter being startled that a ballet exercise in the crossword was NOT plié, and dismissing rond de jambe as too long, it took me just a few seconds to think of FRAPPÉ.

Another tough solve for me. I’m beginning to think I’m in my cognitive decline; not only are the puzzles more fiendishly hard of late, but I’m starting to slip on the Spelling Bee as well.

Sigh, this getting older lark is no fun.\n\nAnyhoo, back to the puzzle. It felt impenetrable at first. I had very little even after the second pass. PANDA was a rare gimme, along with the dogs and the wonderful Ms ROY. The rest fell so slowly, after many breaks for housework and the dog walk. Speaking of; I know many of you in the States are suffering a heat dome, but over here we’re still struggling in our 2nd none Summer. We get a couple of hours of warmth, then the clouds roll in and we’re back to early Spring-like shivering. Brr.\n\nTIL SWEETPEAS were early genetic TESTEES. Such gorgeous little flowers, my home is awash with them at the moment, their heady scent is filling the house. \nOther unknowns today: ARUBA, ADUBA, ATRA and the 19A month.  Never saw the film (not a TC fan), love the way the first 3 rhyme though.\n\nFinal thought; all in all a good Saturday workout, but I now have Wham’s Club TROPICANA tune in my noodle.
