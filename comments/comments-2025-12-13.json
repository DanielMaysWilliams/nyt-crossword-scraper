I ended up consulting the answer key. My error was CORPORATE [c]REED crossing with EC[c]. I'm hopeless with medical abbreviations, especially in English. The Polish equivalent is EKG. And corporate creed was not non5en5ical, which prevented me from spotting the error.\n\nI liked the clueing in this puzzle. It was misleading but in a cool way. The trivia was also kept to a minimum, which is always welcome (albeit I've never heard of that rapper). I also got the impression there was great variety in the entries, which made the puzzle feel fresh.\n\nI found some entries arcane because I'm Polish. For example, our heating systems never involve OIL TANKS. Most of us in cities get our heat from heating plants, and outside cities people use either electricity or gas for heating.

I confess the clever trick passed me by (as I’m sure is the case for most solvers) and I’m glad it didn’t detract from the overall end result. \n\nWhat really fixed me was the TIARA. In my mind, a tiara is a delicate, graceful, bejewelled, glittering, feminine accessory, normally twinned with an artfully admirable hair arrangement. It commands you to admire the wearer’s rank and beauty, and it makes an unmissable declaration of entitlement, while coyly pretending to be understated because - crucially - it is not a crown. \n\nWhy on earth would a Pope be wearing one of those?\n\nWell, today I learned of the “papal tiara”, last used by Paul VI. It’s nothing delicate or understated. It’s more like an oil drum made of gold, or an inflated Christmas cake. Actually, its tiered structure reminds me of the Tower of Babel. What a monstrosity! No wonder it was abandoned. And how fitting, perhaps, that it now lives in Washington DC. (I hope a certain resident of that town never finds out about it - I think it would complete his “look”, not to mention his ego!)\n\nFor a picture of the tiara: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_tiara\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_tiara</a>","createDate":"1765618173","updateDate":"1765674839","approveDate":"1765618175","recommendations":22,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147277573","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9198683500289917}

I'm so glad I'm done with the huge work project that came down to crunch time in the last couple of weeks because now I feel like my brain is more open again. Well and my time. Although now I have to catch up on all the work I didn't do while I was doing that work. Oh well! It helps that I really love my job!!\n\nAnyhow, I would have preferred the constructor's original cluing for 12 down, Obama and Kennedy. I think it would have made it more puzzling. Although it might have also reminded us of that scandalous tan suit!! (Har! I know it really would have referred to the fabulous Michelle and Jackie.)\n\nIsn't it funny how sometimes words just look really wrong, even though they're right? I hope that's not just me.  At 36 across, I plunked in EAGER And for some reason the second E just looked so wrong to me. I was like, that's not how you spell EAGER! It's too weird! So I changed it to an a, which looked even wronger, if you will. I actually very briefly left that box blank. Crazy!! But it happens every now and then where a word I know is right just looks crazy wrong. \n\nOh well, I did get ECG right off the bat, so at least there's that. I had to get one very recently for my annual AFib check-in, so maybe that's why it was on my mind. Happily, my ticker tape was just fine! \n\nMethinks I'm a little too uncouth to appreciate the construction feat today, but it was a fine puzzle and I am happy he also achieved his goal.","createDate":"1765659915","updateDate":"1765708699","approveDate":"1765659917","recommendations":13,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147290975","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8687655329704285}

Also, multiple long answers where more than one appropriate answers may fit greatly detract from the enjoyment of solving the puzzle imho. It astounds me that every puzzle gets rave reviews when the law of averages (and reality) is that they cannot all be winners. I don't want to deny or diminish the thought and effort that goes into creating a puzzle but I am sure there are more people out there of a similar opinion but who don't want to comment or are concerned about being 'crosswordsplained' if they do. Some of the posters are clearly expert crossworders and try to be encouraging but some can be dismissive to any criticism of the puzzle and attribute it to ignorance or lack of intelligence rather than just accepting that there are other valid opinions and that some puzzles are just not that great for a significant minority (possibly a silent majority) of people.

It doesn’t hurt that it had a Thursday vibe and I would probably vote for it as the best on that day as well. This was a Schroedinger rebus with 8(!) themed elements that were clued so that the rebus could contain either UP or DOWN, and there was room for UPS and DOWNS clued separately as revealers. And despite all that, the rest of the fill and clues were darn good as well. A masterpiece. \n\n2/25 Greg Snitkin “Not on my Watch”\nNot the splashiest theme in the world, with the ends of all the themers items that wouldn’t be on digital watches, but I really liked the sly pun of the revealer, all the theme entries were pretty fresh, and the fill was extremely well executed for a Tuesday AND was a pangram to boot.\n\n3/5 Rebecca Goldstein “Haunted Mansion”\nA really unusual grid design that accommodate 4 “haunted” rooms in a house that were all interesting and fresh, with the revealer HAUNTED MANSION stacked in the bottom; and a lot of fun accessory fill including two other long entries. Very impressive\n\n3/11 Jared Cappel “Acupuncture” Again, not the splashiest theme, but 3 solid themers that all were phrases related to what you would do for ACUPUNCTURE, all in order, and the rest of the grid was good enough to be a light themeless puzzle.","createDate":"1765603712","updateDate":"1765651851","approveDate":"1765603714","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147276748,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147276847","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8505743741989136}

Or that the person used 69 different tools to make it?\n\nTo me such \"features\" are completely pointless in that they change nothing for me as the solver when they are implemented well.

The crowns get larger and gaudier, until they are followed by a bloody revolution. Seems like the Vatican didn't catch on to that until the 1960s.
