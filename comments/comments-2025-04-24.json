Like that sci-fi cowboy movie that came out a few years ago. OK, so far I get it. In this particular puzzle, it's called \"mixing thematic elements or tropes,\" and I don't even know what that means. I mean, there is a certain subgenre of mystery that has a kind of coziness to it, but is there some genre of cozy novels I'm unaware of that an author of cozy mysteries is borrowing from? And OK, some fantasies are dark, but how is that genre bending? Are light fantasies also genre bending? What about just simple fantasies, neither light or dark, are they even fantasies then? Maybe they're cozy fantasies, not getting too negative, nor getting anyone in a tizzy. Or dither, if you'd rather. Mockumentary is better, blending elements from comedy and from documentary, two certifiable genres. All the other themers seem simply types of their genre, not really bending anything.

I enjoy Thursday tricks and this was a fine one! Had to puzzle it out but it was very accessible, I thought, and why else do puzzles if you don't want to be puzzled!?  🤔\n\nI was developing an idea at 24D because COZYMYSTER(ies) are kind of my comfort food genre for books and I felt pretty confident it had to somehow be part of the answer. \n\nWhen I found the revealer going down in the lower left, I knew I was on the right path. From there, I was able to pretty quickly fill out all of the themers. Of the TV show movie theme clues, I've only actually watched Stand By Me but they are all pretty well known and the fill did wasn't very difficult to me (STIEB and ACC were complete unknowns but came quickly through the crosses), so once I got the gist of it, it was a pretty quick Thursday. And that's all right because I desperately needed a little after work nap.\n\nI really liked \"Second calling\" for NICKNAME. Surprised myself by so quickly getting EDKOCH. \n\nAnyhow, the Thursday Murder Club is an excellent book series, if anyone likes a good, high quality COZY. The relationships and the issues surrounding aging are really well done. They are both hilarious and heartbreaking at times, and always a good mystery!\n\nI see they're coming out with a TV series of it, which I'm always a bit skeptical of, but what incredible cast! \n\nMy thanks for a nice Thursday!","createDate":"1745536957","updateDate":"1745566981","approveDate":"1745536959","recommendations":7,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141696779","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9651012420654297}

Basically its a board with zero management.   The EMUS (electronic moderators) stop anything with marginally suspect words...And they just let the board run on automatic.    Many posts dont even go up timely...so the sequence of the posts doesnt matter much....other than repetition.\n\nIf there was the ability to have back and forth conversations with real people...where the public posts arent \"permanent\" it creates the need to have many moderators...not just for the puzzle...but for every article the NYT posts.
