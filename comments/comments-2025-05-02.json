When making a Monday or Tuesday puzzle, the theme should be relatively straightforward and simple, and shouldn’t leave solvers scratching their heads. It’s OK, though, for solvers on a Wednesday or a Thursday to have to think a bit before they understand the theme. Along with a simple theme, a constructor making a Monday grid will likely use a grid with a higher word count.\n\nOur maximum word count for themed puzzles is 78 words, and the maximum for a themeless puzzle (Friday or Saturday) is 72 words. The number of words in a grid pretty directly correlates with how difficult the vocabulary in the grid is. A grid with more words (which will be shorter on average) tends to be easier to fill with easier vocabulary that’s more “Monday-friendly.” A 72-word themeless puzzle will likely have easier vocabulary than a 66-word themeless puzzle, which is more likely to be placed on a Saturday. The average Monday puzzle has 76.9 words, compared with 74.6 words on a Thursday, and 68.7 words on a Saturday. A Monday puzzle also tends to have quite a few more black squares — 37.5, compared with 30.9 on a Saturday.\n\n[more]","createDate":"1746198300","updateDate":"1746231580","approveDate":"1746198301","recommendations":6,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141863116","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.504030168056488}
