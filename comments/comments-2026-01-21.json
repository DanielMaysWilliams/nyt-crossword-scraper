Briefly thought of a rebus because of RATABLE, which I thought had an e in it, but everything else worked out without rebuses, so I just went with it. \n\nEspecially in these oh so divided times, the puzzle was a sweet reminder that we're not really so different in so many ways.

The concert harp is tuned in C-flat major. Go figure.\n\nSo when Louis Vierne composed his Mass in C-sharp Minor, he was sub-consciously channeling every other piece in C-sharp he had ever heard, plus it's what fit under his fingers well.\n\n(FWIW, my piano tuner favors something called \"equal-beating Victorian temperament\"--which was developed in 1992!)\n\nYou and I are on very different Wordplay schedules, although you do seem to stop back often and check in on replies, etc. If you read this, leave a reply on my main post.","createDate":"1769027176","updateDate":"1769052199","approveDate":"1769027176","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148228319,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148249130","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7235393524169922}
