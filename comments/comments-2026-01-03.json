I remind you, I very strongly feel that words that might be tangentially used in another context should be allowed—I would never suggest that FROG should never be in a crossword clued as the amphibian because a French person might be offended. And I get that French people eat frog legs and that’s where it comes from. But I do think it can be used as an ethnic slur and the way it is used in this clue can be construed that way. I’m sure no harm was meant—but I remember an infamous puzzle where a word for a certain baseball pitch was innocently included that was read as a slur for Hispanic people and many took offense. This seems like it could be even more overtly inappropriate. I welcome honest and polite discussion especially from our friends in France and of French heritage, and again I sincerely believe that the author or editors, whoever wrote the clue, did not mean to offend anyone, but sometimes lessons can be learned.","createDate":"1767416236","updateDate":"1767477718","approveDate":"1767416238","recommendations":25,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147728385","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.49172863364219666}

My solve time was around my average for this time in the week 30-ish minutes). I'm not sure how I liked the clueing though. It was... Fine? Nothing more than that. No clues struck me as particularly interesting, anyway.\n\nI learned of American EGG HUNTS quite late in life, in my late 20s, from a seasonal event in the MMORPG \"World of Warcraft\", I think. It's not a thing in Poland, or at least it wasn't when I was a kid. All we traditionally did with eggs for Easter was to paint them. We call decorated eggs \"pisanki\". Sometimes whole eggs are used, and sometimes just the shells. You'd make two holes, at the top and bottom, blow into one to get rid of the white and yolk, and proceed to decorate the shell. Barring accidents, such a shell can keep indefinitely, and be used to decorate the Easter table for decades. I last bothered to do any of that as a child. Wooden (or plastic 😢) egg-shaped pisanki also exist. Do an image search for \"polskie pisanki\" to see some of the designs.\n\nAlso, I don't get some stuff. What is the connection between ACAI and a swamp? Is the latter the name of a dish? (If so, why would anybody give an item of food such an unappetizing name?) Or do the berries grow in swamps?\n\nWhat's up with DINER and \"frog sticks\"?","createDate":"1767419356","updateDate":"1767486069","approveDate":"1767419358","recommendations":9,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147728651","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6718533635139465}

In many cases you would never know their first language was French -- they speak perfect English -- well, as perfect as possible in New England. I remember when a good friend married a woman from Ft. Kent, when I went up for the wedding meeting her family. I had no idea, in spite of her French surname, that they spoke French at home. It was an eye-opener, the way they would segue between French and English in mid-sentence. \n\nAnyway, at the University of Maine, there was a student organization for francophone students. Their mascot was a frog, and their the acronym for their name was FAROG (Franco-American Resource Opportunity Group). They published a newsletter in French and English called Le F.A.R.O.G. Forum, with their frog mascot featured on the banner of every issue. They were a very inclusive group. \n\nThe UMaine administration decided some time in the 1980s that the title and mascot were offensive and required the students in the group (all Franco-Americans, mind you) to change the name and remove the frog from their logo. \n\nThe students of FAROG did not like this very much, but the administration stood firm. \n\nIt was a bit of over-reach by the administration, I think. Nobody thought of it as offensive back then, but administrator must do what administrators do.","createDate":"1767460157","updateDate":"1767479532","approveDate":"1767460158","recommendations":18,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147741935","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.495039701461792}

Hard enough to make you think outside the box and require imagination (the best part of the crossword!), and also very solvable. Clues and answers were amply clever without feeling like a reach, and all of the answers were consistent in both spelling and phrasing with real-world usage. \n\nI mention this because it always irks me when answers are bent too hard. Like “yeah this technically works, but…no”.\n\nOne example is from the New Year’s Day puzzle. The answer to the clue “It always wins, they say” was “house”.\n\nIt’s THE house. “House always wins” said no one ever.\n\nI deeply appreciate when puzzles are accurate in this way. ‘Twas the most satisfying Saturday puzzle in recent memory.
