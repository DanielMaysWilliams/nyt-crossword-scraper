You are correct that in baseball, there is the home base, which is more commonly called home plate.  It's called a plate because it's flat and made of hard rubber (it's also five-sided), whereas the other bases are raised and soft (and square).  At home, each pitch is called a ball or a strike by the umpire, and there are also calls of safe and out when a runner is trying to score.\n\nAs Pedant says, it's not likely for the call ORDER UP to be considered to be made \"at the plate,\" so that's why it's a good Saturday clue.

However, I was eventually able to get SUNRA through “hard thought/reasoning”, and I’m sure you could have also: the clue mentions “Afrofuturistic”, and then you’ve got “sun” and “Ra”. Even if you don’t *know* that answer, there's still enough there to *recognize* it once you’re down to the last letter or two (btw I had no clue about the last letter in PANDA either, but that was also amenable to deductive inference, given a bit of patience).\n\n2) Perhaps you could take a step back and consider the fact that plenty of people clearly enjoyed this puzzle and were able to complete it without assistance. While that may not definitively prove the puzzle’s fairness, it should certainly give you pause regarding your own interpretation.
