He has a new book out, Number Freak: From 1 to 200—the Hidden Language of Number Revealed.\n\nIt's a fun book, but definitely challenging.

His \"investment mystery novel,\" A Killing on Wall Street had several scenes at the exclusive Apawamis Club, in Rye. Likewise, Niederman, who has contributed about 20 puzzles to the Sunday New York Times, once famously constructed a squash puzzle in the shape of a racket for the old U.S. Open tournament in Boston. (Sample impenetrable clue: \"What did a tired Kenton Jernigan say after winning the intercollegiate championship?\" Answer: \"Boyumibeat,\" referring to Jernigan's victory over David Boyum, a Harvard champion who went on to collaborate with Niederman on an earlier book, What the Numbers Say: A Field Guide to Mastering Our Numerical World.)\n\nThere is no squash content, it turns out. So I asked the only two squash-related number questions I could think of: 1. With three different scoring systems kicking around—games to 15, 11, or 9—which one is right for me? 2. How many points do you choose to play at deuce? One or two?\n\nOn query one: The 54 year old Niederman, a hardball player at heart, favors the new, point-after-rally scoring system to 11. \"If you are looking to end points, the way a hardball player does, that scoring benefits you,\" he explains. And it also benefits the older player over the younger player. \"You can close out a good lead,\" he says. \"You don't get hung up dueling on individual points.\"","createDate":"1757246836","updateDate":"1757286847","approveDate":"1757246837","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144815426,"parentUserDisplayName":"RI guy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144816336","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9033828377723694}

I prefer to play that menacing, minor-second leitmotiv on my aeolian harp (or better, \"æolian.\")\n\nBut nice touch to clue LEITMOTI(v/F) to John William's music--a couple years ago, I watched all nine of the Star Wars movies, in (release) order. Those soundtracks gave me new respect for Williams as a composer--throughout the course of the movies, he repeats, modifies, develops, connects the musical themes with all the complexity of  Wagner's Ring cycle. It was my favorite part of the movies! Well, that and Queen Amidala's outfits.\n\nSpeaking of Romantic composers--\nThe BASS HORN isn't just a lower version, of, well, a (French) horn--it's a whole other thing, which falls into that class of weird wind instruments, neither brass nor woodwind, which includes cornetti, serpents, and ophecleides. They're mostly considered historical curiosities nowadays, which is a pity, as they have a snarly sound so different from modern tubas etc. Apparently scored his Overture to a Midsummer Night's Dream to include bass horns, but I couldn't find a good, period-instrument recording. However, here's Roger Norrington leading the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, in the March from Berlioz' Symphony Fantastique, whose orchestration includes the closely related ophecleides.
