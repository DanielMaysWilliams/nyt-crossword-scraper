A text adventure, with limited descriptions and which allowed only two word commands, you had to do a lot of imagining to visualize where you were and what to do. In other words, good training for a Thursday puzzle.\n\nI struggled a bit for a while until the revealer sunk in and I went back and found the theme answers that I was wondering about and saw the light. That made the last two a little easier. Also had REnegED instead of REVOKED for a while. which made the alternate spelling for ShIVA fit and got the NW finished.\n\nWasn't happy about the clue for PERP, because on shows like the First 48, the perps are prominent in the story and although the detectives are featured, there wouldn't be a show without the perps, they're definitely not \"extras.\"\n\nAnyway, I got it done, but I was a bit over my average, but any time I get to figure out the trick, I'm happy.\n\nThanks, Simeon!","createDate":"1755753964","updateDate":"1755784787","approveDate":"1755753966","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144424806","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5884587168693542}

Sorry to say today won’t be much better. Really quite a miserable one, huh?\n\nIt really is something when a constructor scours Google for random obscure trivia to throw into a puzzle just to make it “harder”. Many of you will defend that, and that’s your choice. I say it’s cheap.\n\nSpeaking of cheap, we come to the beloved Thursday trickery that so many seem to fawn over. Well, I actually thought today’s was extremely clever, and a neat twist on the crossword idea. Unfortunately, I don’t think it fully worked, as, per usual, the horizontal words were complete throwaways when solving, and, having nothing to do with the written clue, became another sad cheap trick at difficulty. Again, though, I know how many of you like that kind of thing.\n\nFinally, the cluing. I found some of it appropriate while some other clues completely mind boggling. Truly not sure what goes on at NYT Games editorial to allow some of these to pass, but I suppose standards can’t always be up to snuff.\n\nI look forward to the deluge of comments from the valiant defenders of the NYT Crossword comments section.

Printed the ferry schedule out and all, but the day looked cloudy and cool, and threatened rain, so I decided to postpone. \nFrankly, not all that much there, but there are a couple interesting geological and ecological sites: a monumental set of limestone grooves, carved out by glaciers--when I was a small child, one could climb on them, but that's not permitted anymore (probably never was.) Also, lakeside alvars--natural limestone \"pavement,\" with just enough soil to sustain some scrubby, alpine plant life. Once again, I think they're considered a \"fragile\" ecosystem, and one is not supposed to climb on them, but everyone does, to picnic, and go swimming in the lake off of them.\n\nAlso, the ferry is kind of a rip off--there's only one, so it's a monopoly--no discount for a round trip ticket (I mean, who would buy a one-way ticket, unless you were mortally ill and wished to end one's days on the North Shore Alvar)--PLUS they charge you to bring a bike on the ferry, AND they charge you to park the car on their lot.

Once I got how the theme worked, it helped me finish up the others. Really cute and fun! Had to clean up more wrong answers than usual. SelecT instead of SPIGOT, appS before DVRS, gEl before NET, kneel before BOWTO, and silliest of all, thingsgoUP instead of WHATGOESUP... I knew what saying it was getting at but silly ole brain took some time getting there. One of my slower Thursdays, but I got there and loved it! Huzzah!!\n\nLove your story, Deb! 🩵 When did I know my husband was a KEEPER, you ask?! When we were in our first year or so of dating, I was driving (he usually did) and I had my hand lightly on his leg (shocking, I know!) and my favorite song came on the radio. I have a long and glorious history of being overly enthusiastic (who, me!?) about the song—Juke Box Hero by Foreigner. So, in normal HeathieS (as I was known at the time) fashion, I turned up the volume and started rocking out with some mild head banging, my long hair flying, basically pounding on his leg like a drum, as I sang the entire song at very near the top of my lungs.... yes, while still driving. I was just a kid of 32, I didn't know any better! Har! \n\nAnyhow, it ends and he said, \"Wow, that was really nice, babe! Seems like you really like that song.\" 🤣 But the main KEEPER thing is that he didn't open the door and roll out... risking death to save himself—and he kept asking me out. Enthusiasm aside, I am not what you call a good singer.","createDate":"1755806546","updateDate":"1755823640","approveDate":"1755806547","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144446474","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9311829209327698}

The clue for the right side was the beginning of the clue for that word and the clue for the left side was the end of that word, with ellipses to suggest they continued on. So for example the right hand entry might be IMP and clued as “African ant…”, the left hand “ALA” and clued as “…elope” and if you folded it into a cylinder the entire clue would be “African antelope” —IMPALA.

If you think the clueing could be better etc. then that’s different but if you think the theme is too hard then that’s where I’d want to speak up because I liked it and I’d hate to see themes of this type go away (respecting of course your opinion to feel and say otherwise).\nRegarding Googling things to put in the puzzle to make them harder, I doubt this is happening, at least on theme puzzles. When I create puzzles what happens is I end up having some difficult entries that are necessary for the constraints of the theme entries. Yes, a program may identify those and yes sometimes I need to Google them because I don’t know them. Then I have to decide if I can get away with it, try to make sure the crossing clues are fair, check to see if the word has been used before, etc. When I assess a puzzle’s value, part of my assessment is whether the clunky areas are justified because of a difficult but entertaining theme. In any case I guarantee this constructor didn’t go out of their way to pick ETOILE or KIROV or TSENG, they were just stuck with them; maybe a better constructor could have done better but it wasn’t deliberate. Except maybe ZORK because DORK could have worked as well, but perhaps the constructor just had fond memories of the game.","createDate":"1755802788","updateDate":"1755824387","approveDate":"1755802790","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144442744,"parentUserDisplayName":"D","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144445269","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-21","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5977655053138733}

In practice I think 21 August 2025 is a much cleaner and more functional notation than August 21st, 2025. It depends on the formality of the context and the goal of the communication. Certainly some things come across as a little fussy and there are certain punctuation/notation choices that have a distinct boomer vibe (ie- using too many commas--OXFORD COMMA EXCEPTED, putting a period after common abbreviations, or double spacing after sentences, etc.) but it's probably fine regardless.

This is common in more formal or literary writing.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"The meeting is scheduled for October 21st.\"\n\n\"She was born on the 3rd of May.\"\n\n\"We met on the 1st of January.\"\n\nWhen to Omit Suffixes\nIn most professional, business, or casual contexts, it's standard practice to omit the suffixes. This is especially true for digital communication, forms, and official documents where clarity and conciseness are prioritized.\n\nExamples:\n\n10/21/2025\n\nOctober 21, 2025\n\n\"The deadline is October 21, 2025.\"\n\n\"Final report due: May 3.\"\n\nIn summary, for formal writing in a sentence, the suffix is correct. For all other practical purposes, especially in a digital context, it's best to leave it out.","createDate":"1755813840","updateDate":"1755833787","approveDate":"1755813842","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144447630,"parentUserDisplayName":"John Carson","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144448607","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8711372017860413}
