He has the chops, in his themeless puzzles, to clue at the highest level, with wit and guile.  Today his skill in building a themed puzzle really shines.  Look at what he had to do:\n•\tFind theme answers that would accommodate the pay bump words.\n•\tBecause of symmetry requirements, three pairs of these answers had to have an equal number of letters.\n•\tThat “bump” letter above the theme answer, greatly restricts what the vertical answer that includes it can be.\n•\tTheme answers had to be chosen and placed in a certain order to make the gray-lettered PAY BUMP happen.\n\nSid made it work.  On top of all this, Sid spaced nine NYT debuts answers pretty evenly around the grid, giving it pop.  Terrific build.\n\nMy fill-in included a big wow moment when I simultaneously saw and grokked the theme elements.  It also included getting two out-of-my-wheelhouse long answers – FREQUENCY SHIFT and MOOD CONGRUENCE – which happified my brain on several levels.  And I loved seeing all the long-o enders: EL PASO, BONGO, TITO, AMMO, OSSO, ECHO, DITTO, DYNAMO, EURO, and wannabe DITTOS.\n\nThus, a splendid outing, as I’ve come to expect with Sunday in the box with Sid.

And I really love Sunday puzzles! The cluing today was really fun. I can't tell you which I loved most because I just don't have that much time in a whole day. Every new clue made me laugh. I needed that laugh today, because I am also writing my mom's eulogy; her funeral is in a few days and doing the puzzles today was a nice break. In our family, doing puzzles together on a Sunday was a ritual while I was growing up. In later years, after she and Dad moved to Florida, I would sometimes call her to help me finish a puzzle. She would do them all, when she was younger...cryptoquotes, jumbles, XWDs, anything that came her way.\n\nI think she stopped doing them somewhere around age 98. Her eyesight wasn't as good. By age 100, I could still ask her to help me with them, but it wasn't the same. She lived to over 103, long enough to influence a few generations of word and puzzle lovers. \n\nSo I dedicate today's win to her, because I suspect that somewhere, she was helping me with it, whether I knew it or not. \n\nThanks Mom.","createDate":"1730671936","updateDate":"1730717538","approveDate":"1730671939","recommendations":25,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137320118","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9754061698913574}

Otherwise it might be pronounced \"Odeeza\" in English. Since Ukrainian uses the Cyrillic alphabet there's always the dilemma\n* Do you use a traditional transliteration, even if it is no longer considered politically correct or opportune? (E.g. Kiev) \n* Do you follow an official transliteration system even if it does not result in something that can easily be pronounced correctly? (e.g. Zelenskyy) \n* Do you use a spelling that leads a reader of the target language to get the pronunciation sort of right without having to overthink? (E.g. Selenski, the German transliteration of Mr. Zelenskyy). \n\nIt's especially tricky when a traditional transliteration could lead to the assumption that ownership is disputed or illegally claimed. German-language media still use the traditional Russian-sounding Kiew (yep, with a W here), but have easily adopted Luhansk (over Russian Lugansk), Dnipro (over Dnjepropetrowsk) or Lwiw (over Lwow), even though the latter are all still in everybody's old high school atlas.

Some of those names go back a thousand years, to the medieval Rus states, such as Ruś Kijowska (Kyivan Rus), others are more recent, but still quite old.

The twin cities of Odessa and Midland (about 20 miles apart) each have a population of just over 100,000.  They are in sparsely-populated west Texas, and exist primarily because they sit in the center of a huge oil-producing region.  They are awash in money, and one of the ways this has manifested is through obscenely-over-funded American football teams at their high schools.  They have stadiums to rival large college programs, all the newest equipment, and a large staff of coaches, trainers, etc.  The football games have become the cultural focus of both communities.  This has created an epic rivalry between two schools in particular -- Odessa High School and Permian Basin High School (in Midland).  This rivalry was used as the model for the fictional American television series called Friday Night Lights (so named because high school games are almost always played on Friday evenings).  When the TV show became a huge hit, Odessa, Texas suddenly became known on a national level here in the States.  So for American solvers, the way it was clued makes total sense.","createDate":"1730678897","updateDate":"1730679560","approveDate":"1730678900","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137309820,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137320930","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8181155323982239}

I never check the title before attempting a solve, so the PAY BUMP did not become obvious until after completion, when I read the title, along with the instructions for the shaded squares. Yes, I saw the connection…  but it fell rather flat. Surely I had missed something? It turns out that since I do these puzzles on my phone, the individual squares are small enough on Sunday  that I indeed had somehow completely missed noticing the circles. It wasn’t until I read the column and went back and checked the grid that I had my “D’oh” moment! 🙄\n\nI enjoy the Friday and Saturday themeless puzzles, but I did appreciate the extra level to Sid’s nicely crafted endeavor.
