I’m an avid crossword solver for the last 3 years when my sister introduced me to the puzzles over a Christmas. Sprawled on the carpet we penciled in our guesses. I was hooked. I’d always thought crossword puzzles were for the gray-haired, sitting in their rocking chairs at 6am with a cup of joe. Little did I know at the time, this would become a hallmark hobby that makes me, me. \n\nNow I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed - as I read the comments here I’m acutely aware of how studied this community is. I haven’t opened a book in years, I’ve got my undergrad degree in business, and besides this my hobbies are mostly sports. Beyond that I’m a young millennial, a benefit to fill in the occasional NOCAP or SUS, but very unstudied in the pop culture before me. Alas, I press on!\n\nNow the inclusive thing about puzzles is that we can set our own rules. I chose strict method of “no outside study allowed”: if I were to be handed this puzzle on a remote isle, I’d be as likely to complete it as I am each day. Often I’m devastated to not get the little gold pixels by missing just a few boxes. A fun benefit of this is I can see very clearly my progress over the last few years. It’s fun to see the early weeks where I didn’t bother to attempt anything beyond Mondays. As I sit here on a train in London, I’ve failed this Thursday due to the left center cluster. But I am proud of me! There will be another Thursday, and it will be golden.\n\nAnd there I am, a chronic lurker no more!","createDate":"1768476741","updateDate":"1768562318","approveDate":"1768476742","recommendations":84,"replyCount":16,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148078987","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8402776718139648}

As the author of a recent book on Sondheim, his games, and his crossword puzzles, I was excited to see this puzzle. As this is still news to most, I’ll share a little known history behind the song Finishing the Hat. It could have been called Finishing the Game. In 1965 his friend Phyllis Newman had a show flop out of town. He asked what he could do and she said make a game for me when I return. He designed The Murder Game in an overnight 11-hour creative fugue. It was a hit (and has its own story). In the early 80s, creating Sunday in the Park With George, he wanted to write a song about that experience, about disconnecting from the world to pursue a creative pursuit, not to paint something new but to create a playful way for his friends to connect. So now, his song, about a game, has been honored in a crossword. Quite fitting.","createDate":"1768477912","updateDate":"1768562356","approveDate":"1768477912","recommendations":40,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148079361","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.918777346611023}

One of the most difficult parts was having them memorize every tune, because there was no way of committing the melodies to paper. Guido noticed that a certain psalm they were singing, \"Ut queant laxis\", began each line on a successively higher note of the musical scale. He took the syllables on the first note of each line, Ut Re MI Fa Sol La, made those the names of the respective tones, and devised a way of representing them as markings on a system of parallel horizontal lines (our musical staff). Later the seventh note, the \"leading tone\", was given the name \"Sí\" from the initials of Sancti Ioannes, to whom the psalm had been dedicated. \"Ut\" was changed to \"Do\" so that all the notes began with a consonant. With various improvements over the years, this is the musical notation used ever since, all over the world. \n\nIn the 19th century an English system of reading music was invented, in which Sol lost its L (so that all the notes had two-letter names) and Sí became Ti (so that they all began with a different letter). These changes were not adopted in Italy nor (as far as I know) anywhere else in Europe. It's still basically Guido's system, though! \n\nI feel particularly close to this subject, having taught for years here in Tuscany for the Fondazione Guido d'Arezzo.","createDate":"1768495910","updateDate":"1768565312","approveDate":"1768495910","recommendations":89,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148092998","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8460970520973206}
