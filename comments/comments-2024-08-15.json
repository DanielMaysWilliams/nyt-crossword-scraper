I'm not sure what everyone's mileage was on this one but I thought the eggcorns were fun. \n\nTook a bit longer than it probably would have for me to figure it out if I were home, but it did give a big aha and a chuckle out loud when I got it! I had one and a half of the theme answers figured out before I knew what was happening —the revealer did help me get the others. I really struggled with Grade A quality though because I thought it was going to be something about equality. Even after I filled out CLOUDY SKIES, I was puzzled. By then, I was alone in the office and started saying it out loud and aha! I got it! Nice!\n\nPlease, someone make me remember AGORA. I always know that I know it and have encountered it... but I can't ever just pull that one back out. I'm pretty sure it was just in a puzzle a few days ago! C'mon HeathieJ's brain, in the words of many commenters in past puzzles: Do better! Ha! \n\nAnyhow, there were a few words/names in there that I didn't know before but I trust that they do actually exist and are fair as I was able to work out everything on the crosses. For a moment, I thought I'd need a lookup on one crossing—but I got there!  Huzzah!!\n\nTime for happy hour!
