Count me among the disappointed (and after such a stellar Saturday!). I think the Puzzle Notes clues should have been in the actual puzzle, clued for the left side entry, with the right side having only an em dash. To me, that would have integrated the theme into the puzzle and been much more challenging. As it was, this was a pretty simplistic solve and I only noticed the trick with the center column after I finished and the app revealed the missing letters. Frankly, if I were doing this on paper, I'd probably still be wondering where the theme was.

Today something very interesting happened with my solve. I thought that I had a very early breakthrough - yet it turned out to be all for nothing. With only the T in square 18, I looked at the clue for 68D and said to myself “I know that”. It had to be “They’re Coming to Take me Away, Ha Ha!” I remembered this Number 1 song in Canada, and it fit perfectly into place, including the T at square 18. Furthermore it was by someone called Napoleon XIV. And Napoleon Bonaparte had played an important role in the music of Beethoven who also composed “Für Elise”. It all seemed to click and I really thought I was on to something here. I prided myself on guessing such an unlikely clue so early on. Well, I soon realized, when none of any crosses would work (except for ODE at 78A), that I would have to tear that idea up, and it was not until much later that I could fill in the Doors classic. To add insult to injury, I looked up “They’re Coming to Take me Away, Ha Ha!”, and it was actually from 1966, not 1967.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, this was a terrific puzzle and a very enjoyable Saturday night romp!\n\nCheers to old Wordplay friends!","createDate":"1752371112","updateDate":"1752448199","approveDate":"1752371113","recommendations":68,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143493152","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6736037135124207}

I didn't realize, not being a major Doors fan, how obscure the song in the puzzle is.  Sure, I knew Love Her Madly, Light My Fire, Riders on the Storm, and perhaps a few more, but I figured maybe I'd missed one of their major hits.  It was possible.\n\nBut the song in the puzzle was NOT a hit at all.  It was their first attempt to literally \"break on through\" the charts, but it failed miserably.  This debut release only went as high as 126 on the Billboard 200, which means that it hardly, if ever, got onto most radio stations.  No other song they charted stayed that low.  I had never heard of it because it was a flop.  \n\nTheir next song, Light My Fire, hit number one, and they were off to the races.\n\nTo call BREAK ON THROUGH a \"classic 1967 song\" is dubious at best.

Brilliant. I myself did NOT mind the I.T \"giveaway\" at the end that showed the vertical \"HOLEINTHEWALL\". I'd actually forgotten about the 1D & 114D hints & hadn't really parsed out the 'extra' 8 clues in relation to the puzzle (I mean, on quick perusal of the 8 clues in the \"Info\" window before starting the puzzle I of course knew #2 was Beethoven but decided I'd parse all of that out later & then forgot!). But how delightful when THE DOORS broke on through when I solved the puzzle!\n\nNote: I'm not religious, even though a rabbi's daughter, but for the past 4 or 5 years I've tended each year to participate (online) in virtual Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services of a very very cool local congregation in Chicago (strictly virtual the 1st year or 2 of the pandemic, but they resumed live services since then, still offering virtual participation option). They always end the Yom Kippur closing service— the figurative \"closing of the gates\"— w/the congregation singing The Doors' \"Knocking on Heaven's Door\".  I usually head to the lake (real close by) for that part of the service, connected via smartphone, amid the lovely sunset at the beach. Very, very cool.\n\nBrandon Koppy's xwords are some of my absolute favorites. If you haven't seen his photo, may be peek at his page/ today's puzzle at xwordinfo.com. Classic pose of \"Yeah I love my family but having kids is exhausting\" or something. Very droll.\n\nDelightful puzzle. Great song.

Too much esoterica and poor clueing (e.g. “it lets you move north” for UPARROW, “blazer” for COAT, and even “wedding exchange” (singular) for IDOS (plural)) don’t help. As others have noted, I would also have expected the positions of the “holes in the wall” (1/114D) to be indicated in some way.\n\nThis puzzle just had so much going on that I think the constructor forgot a few basics about what makes a crossword fun to solve. I know how hard it is to make puzzles like this, but I’ve seen many superior themed puzzles get completely ripped to shreds in the comments so I’m trying to understand why this one was better received.

My sister and I were the only females around.  We were the unofficial scorekeepers, moving the pegs on a wooden board. The bocce court was in the back yard of a player who lived high on the hill, and he would ring a bell to get a game going. Almost every man kept a vegetable garden, so it was likely that most of them would be outside to hear the bell. I don’t know if they had planned game times, but I suppose they did.  They spoke English, mostly, but used Italian for some elements of the game, particularly to swear at bad shots. At home, my parents didn’t speak a lot of Italian because they spoke different dialects and teased each other about their accent. (My grandparents grew up in northern Italy but my parents were born in the U.S.) At home, we used Italian words for a lot of foods. As a result, I could be fluent if served bad food. \n\nRegarding the spelling question, I only know bocce but, with almost all things Italian, I figure there is a lot of room for creativity.  I worked there briefly and that was even true in banking and the postal service.","createDate":"1752402606","updateDate":"1752437997","approveDate":"1752402608","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143493076,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mike","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143495435","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8661620616912842}

One might neglect to notice it on another day, but I am surprised that you would not have expected it to be there on a Sunday.\n\nA classic is in no way related to its popularity at the moment of creation. Many artistic classics were flops at the time they were created and became classics by their enduring and growing reputation through the passage of time. I would argue that this is the case here. On the contrary, many number 1 songs from 60 years ago are completely forgotten now and definitely not classics. (For example the \"song\" I initially entered, as mentioned in an earlier comment.) According to Wikipedia, Break on Through was ranked by The Guardian in 2021 as No. 2 of all Doors songs. (I'm assuming that Light My Fire was number 1.) I think its description as a classic is well-deserved.","createDate":"1752409362","updateDate":"1752495860","approveDate":"1752409363","recommendations":23,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143495518,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143496515","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.791412353515625}
