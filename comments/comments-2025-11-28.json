I completed the puzzle in Tuesday/Wednesday time, and just 3 minutes slower than this week's Monday (which was surprisingly difficult for me). Now I'm wondering if the grid was undercooked for this late in the week, or maybe my good performance was down to that preternatural clarity of mind one sometimes enjoys having woken up way too early.\n\nThere was nothing particularly interesting about this one, was there? Just one thing comes to mind: would a sommelier recommend the house wine, of all things? I don't know about the US but in Europe house wine usually is good value for money and perfectly fine for casual wine drinkers. It's what you get when you're not a wine snob, often after rolling your eyes at the expensive wine list the sommelier presents you with, taking you for the sort of person who will pay three times as much for a glass of red than for your main dish 🤷🏽","createDate":"1764300470","updateDate":"1764393540","approveDate":"1764300472","recommendations":53,"replyCount":22,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146932309","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.757543683052063}

Gotta thank Steve L today, if memory serves, for using SETTERS in a comment recently which would have been a mystery otherwise. Gotta show some love for ROSIE although it’s a gutsy call to cite a character who is barely in the books or movie; still that last scene of LOTR is so affecting and IMO is one of the best endings in literature, I for one will never forget her name.

I tried REED for the James in the R&B hall of fame, thinking of the great Jimmy Reed, and only got RICK from the crosses.  I was puzzled as to who James Rick was until the lightbulb illuminated, oh RICK James.  Got me. Face Palm.\n\nI was thrilled to see ARTTATUM make an appearance here.  He’s one of my favorite jazz pianists whose intricate riffs on the great American songbook for solo piano, are nothing short of amazing.  Some find his style too ornate, but his technique, replete with glissandos and embellishments, is beyond compare.  So high was his reputation among his peers that Fats Waller (no slouch himself) was reputed to have said upon seeing Tatum enter a club where Fats was playing, “I’m just a piano player, but God is in the house.”  If you give him a listen, play the tune several times, the depth and complexity of what he’s doing become clearer on repeat listening, but he never forsakes the original melody.  The clue references Tea For Two, but my favorites are Aunt Hagar’s Blues and The Way You Look Tonight.","createDate":"1764301583","updateDate":"1764396913","approveDate":"1764301584","recommendations":23,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146932445","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9272732734680176}

Tomorrow it's back to the plonk no sommelier would tout, some Apothic $5.99 stuff I happen to like. I also like cheese curls.\n\nHow many of you had Etta before Rick?

Answer -- me and me.\n\nPoor Uta Hagen, the only Uta famous enough to be in a crossword, and I guess for Fridays a \"setter\" must avoid her, since that would be overly tried and true, so then it's on to the sports ticker clues, nothing to be done about it. Poor setter. \n\nI endorse the soundtrack of this puzzle: Art Tatum, Rick James, Bono, the Maytals.
