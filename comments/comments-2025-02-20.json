It replaced one- and two-digit zones in cities, and in fact, replaced the \"City, State\" part of an address from the point of view of the post office (although those items are still traditionally included, if they are omitted, the mail would still get there.)  So the \"zip\" of zip code is actually an acronym for \"zone improvement plan\".\n\nBut zip is also slang for ZERO, or as they say across the pond, nought.\n\nAs I'm sure you have figured out, the home plate UMPire in baseball calls balls and strikes (as we discussed just a day ago) during a batter's turn at bat.  A strike is a pitch in the strike zone that the batter doesn't attempt to hit, one he swings at and misses, or hits foul (except for the third strike, or that is caught on the fly by any fielder).  As of just last year, a strike can be called against a batter who is not ready in the prescribed amount of time for the next pitch.  A ball is a pitch outside the strike zone that the batter doesn't attempt to hit.  Four balls is a walk (free pass to first base); three strikes, and the batter is out.\n\nAgain, probably more than you wanted to know about baseball.

It's one of those movies that you had to see in the context of the era in which it was made. For one thing, science fiction special effects hadn't gotten much further than small wobbly spaceship models on wires, so the leap forward was spectacular. Another aspect was the fact that it was made as a Cinerama film, with its huge curving screen, high resolution, and state-of-the-art (for then) sound, and it's a shame that most people will never experience it like that.

It seemed very hard at first, but then things started to fall in place in clumps, each clump after a bit of a struggle.\n\nThe theme was definitely helpful, which I always appreciate.\n\nBut I get what you are saying, as that is my experience too. Sometimes a puzzle is just too hard for me, and then I read the comments and find that I am mostly alone.\n\nAnd while my ego can get pretty bruised, which is not fun, I find solace in knowing when to give up. \n\nSometimes, after going around in circles for five or ten minutes, I get the sense that it is time to give up, which I hate to do. And when I do the reveal, I see that the one or two places I was struggling with would never have come to me, and I feel a bit of satisfaction at not having continued a fruitless struggle.\n\nBut today, my random bits of vaguely remembered tidbits, such as the Olmec being a mesoamerican culture, came in handy.

Fun with palindromes. \n\nThanks for sharing your experience. And you're right, ultimately, I was glad I revealed. I rarely do it, I can almost always figure it out in the end... I have a hard time giving up on things, just generally speaking, but when I saw the revealed answers, I knew I'd have never finished. \n\nAs much as I love doing these puzzles, I am learning that if one is such a struggle and not a fun struggle anymore (again, rare) I don't have to keep going. It's not a job or other responsibilities, I can just stop. \n\nI've realized that with reading too. For my first four decades, I suppose, I felt I had to finish a book no matter how I disliked it. I'd trudge through at any cost hoping and expecting it to improve and be justified.\n\nAt some point, I was reading a book that I hated so much and found that I actively didn't care what happened to any of the horrible people in it, and I couldn't imagine there was any redemption to be had, so I (shockingly) decided to be done and my last decade or so of reading has been much better for it. Fortunately, hating a book also doesn't happen often because I like a lot of different things. :-)\n\nAnyhow, sounds a bit silly, but that was a big thing for me.   My stick-to-itiveness has been with me kind of to a fault, so it's kind of freeing to give myself a bit more grace as I age.. even if it's just with books and puzzles.  :-)","createDate":"1740091954","updateDate":"1740139918","approveDate":"1740091955","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139963272,"parentUserDisplayName":"HeathieJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139965442","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8649156093597412}
