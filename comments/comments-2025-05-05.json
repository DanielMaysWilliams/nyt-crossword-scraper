My dentist and me, we go way back. Dr. Nimrod. Don't remind me! With my teeth,  I saw him several times a year.

Once I had to get a root canal and he said, \"OK, we're gonna uncap that tooth and see what's under the stump: that's where the roots are, right?\" His decor was pretty simple: a poster of Tamara de Lempicka's \"Young Lady With Gloves\" on the facing wall, and I'd stare at her and wonder what she was thinking, if anything. \"I just heard you moana little...are you getting sorer?\" the dentist asked. \n\n\"Thirst,\" I mumbled. \"Sure,\" he said, pausing from hammering nails into the abrasion that was my mouth (that's how it felt anyway) and taking a pad to wipe away some stray bits, \"it's not like we're in Saudi Arabia. Drink all you want. But tonight no carne asada. At the most, yam, maybe an acai smoothie.\"\n\nAs he got back to work, Led Zeppelin's \"Coda\" started playing.

John Naughton was my next door neighbor- until he became wealthy from his invention and moved to the ritzy part of town.\n\n\nExcerpt from dentalez.com: \"Then in 1958, inventor John Naughton of Des Moines, Iowa, worked with Dr. John Anderson to create the Den-Tal-Ez J-Chair¬Æ. Widely regarded as the first modern dental chair, the J-Chair featured a split back that allowed the patient to be put in a supine position so the dentist could get as close to the patient‚Äôs head as possible . This invention set the stage for sit-down dentistry, the way dentists around the world still practice today.\"","createDate":"1746424749","updateDate":"1746498602","approveDate":"1746424750","recommendations":20,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141908386","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6123179793357849}

In many villages it is the only building with a large enough space to party. I love how Polish law reflects this.

I'd raise a finger if there was any actual pain, and we'd pause while a nerve block went in.\nI actually preferred to avoid local if at all possible, because in those days the nerve block used to hurt more than the filling ... admittedly, because the filling was superficial and unnecessary!\n\nSounds like your experience was different from mine, but I thought I might point out the rationale for \"no local\" fillings, in those days, in some cases, in a willing patient.","createDate":"1746406640","updateDate":"1746492474","approveDate":"1746406641","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141906382,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141906989","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5563256740570068}
