First, \"Camus\" was a bicycle manufacturer in France of road bikes in the 1970s and 1980s. I had a friend who rode a Camus and swore by them, even though I'd often see him pushing it endlessly uphill, like Sisyphus. You can still find Camus bikes on ebay. I never cared for them myself, preferring my three-speed Sartre. They're no longer being made, having faced an existential threat. My wife had an old De Beauvoir bicycle-built-for-two (the additional seat was for the Second Sex). \n\nSecond, Camus was well known for dividing his work into \"cycles,\" each cycle being a work of fiction, a drama and an essay, all on a single theme or philosophical idea. I don't know how many different cycles comprises his oeuvre but that's how he thought of them. \n\nLove this theme, having been just the age that \"Breaking Away\" was MY favorite movie as a teenager. Then I got hooked on the Tour de France during the Lance Armstrong era, and I still kinda miss him, he was captivating and weird. (Leachman is an anagram of Lance Ham -- and he was a bit of a ham, and his excuses were rather ham-handed...which is what people with fat finger syndrome often end up being). \n\nAlso enjoyed the pairing of SAT SHIVA with REAR UP and the presence of STEPS CLASS in a puzzle about biking. And between chianti, rye and a hot toddy, I might just say \"Scusi\" a few times as my bike wobbles off the road.","createDate":"1720580818","updateDate":"1721219960","approveDate":"1720580820","recommendations":67,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134543402","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7749666571617126}

The symmetry is the normal rotational symmetry, because the focus is not on the puzzle’s design, but rather on the subject of the tribute.\n\nBut looky here.  The subject of today’s tribute puzzle – the Tour De France -- isn’t even in the grid!  The theme answers include diagonals going up!  The symmetry is diagonal (as if the puzzle is folded on a line going from the NW to SE corner)!\n\nAnd it works!  Those diagonal answers in the circles climb like the cyclists scaling the mountains.  The diagonal symmetry subtly gives that climbing feeling as well.  And how brilliant to leave TOUR DE FRANCE out of the grid?  We all know that’s what this puzzle is about, why waste the space?  We learn in writing class that suggesting rather than telling is more effective, and I found it marvelous in this puzzle.\n\nSo, bravo on this creative tribute puzzle, pushing the envelope.  Bravo on including two answers that I can’t believe haven’t appeared in the Times puzzle in its 80 years – the iconic CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES, and the acting great Cloris LEACHMAN.  And bravo on some crackling cluing, such as [How to become a new hue] for DYE – Hah!\n\nBig thumbs up, Hal, for this witty and filled-with-spark offering, fun and satisfying to complete, and out there in the very best way.
