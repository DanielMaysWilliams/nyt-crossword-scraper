I turned to go back to our house, and I saw them!  They were hanging on a telephone pole, where they must have been all night and all day.

Sometimes a reference might make a work of art richer, but dissecting it often just flattens and drains away the quality that makes it art.\n\nMemorizing a poem will allow you to find meaning that you didn't see before; really looking at a painting carefully engages your sensibilities in ways that words can't communicate.
