And, if you make a puzzle with him, you will eventually be exceedingly grateful to him for insisting on it.\n\nSome lovely answers in SLEUTH, SMOLDER, and MEASLY. Also, after Monday's PUT ON A SHOW theme brought into the theater of my mind Ethel Merman brassily belting out \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\", how sweetly serendipitous that STYNE, who wrote the music to that song, shows up today.  \n\nIn addition, the rebel in me liked seeing QUIET on the Eastern Front.\n\nJeanne, I loved how you, step-by-step, went from the dream of making a NYT-worthy crossword to its reality, as described in your notes.

If you go to the town pier and look straight north, you will be staring at Bar Island and its tombolo. It is a much longer tombolo than the one at Barred Island in Deer Isle.

This week I'm thrilled to be visiting her and playing in person.
