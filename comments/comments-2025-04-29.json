The actual relation is non-linear (convex) and so we approximate the change with a tangent line. \n\nThe slope of the TANGENT LINE is called duration, and it's a super important concept for bond investors because it gives them a very intuitive sense of price volatility of their bond for a 1 percent (100 basis point) change in yields. Longer term bonds generally have higher duration (in case you're wondering) and this is why investors prefer short term bonds in times of financial uncertainty (like I don't know, right now.)\n\nI'm always jumping up and down and drawing pictures on the board when I teach this. \n\nCan't wait to show this puzzle to my Fall students. \n\nIf both TANGENT LINES and DURATION showed up in the same puzzle, my life would be complete 🤣🤣.","createDate":"1745930088","updateDate":"1745970085","approveDate":"1745930089","recommendations":10,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141785468","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-29","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.955471932888031}

Release the pressure---pain goes away.\nSo releasing that pressure in the ER (\"Casualty\", as it used to be known in the UK) was immensely satisfying. \nBack in the day, we used a paperclip and a cigarette lighter. I'm sure there's some very expensive gizmo that does the same thing, these days.\nYou partially straighten the paper clip, so that you have the sort of \"tool\" that you can improvise to push the recessed reset button on some electronic devices. Then you heat the end to red heat with the cigarette lighter. Then you *lightly* rest the hot end on the patient's nail, over the haematoma. Smoke rises as the hot end burns through the nail ...\n\nSuspense mounts ...\n\nAnd as soon as the clip burns through the nail, it's flipped upwards by the pressure of the confined blood, which squirts dramatically into the air.\n\nPatient heaves a sigh of relief, shakes hands with doctor, and goes home with a tale to tell that no-one will believe.","createDate":"1745964577","updateDate":"1745972889","approveDate":"1745964578","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141800757,"parentUserDisplayName":"Grant","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141802422","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5921249985694885}

The same is true about Americans and Irish. Whereas ST PATS seems very wrong to you, it’s fairly common and normal here. \n\nIrish immigrants brought their culture to the US, but things diverged somewhat. For example, here, a typical “Irish” meal for March 17, whatever you call the day, is corned beef and cabbage, which is not typical in Ireland. \n\nIn a similar vein, Cinco de Mayo is the “big Mexican holiday” in the US, whereas it’s not a major holiday in most of Mexico. And we consider hard-shelled tacos to be the quintessential Mexican dish, but they’re virtually unknown south of the border. \n\nSimilarly, spaghetti and meatballs, our idea of a typical Italian meal, is barely found in Italy.  Most supposedly Chinese dishes were invented in the US and are unknown in China. \n\nCultures come to the US and do their own thing. So if you visit us in March, be prepared to have corned beef and cabbage on ST. PAT’S day. At least the shamrock is still the same.","createDate":"1745963491","updateDate":"1746010244","approveDate":"1745963492","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141798311,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ciarán","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141801980","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7644859552383423}
