Surprised there was no mention of Dover Cliffs -- made of the soft white limestone called chalk, lovely place (and fine poem by Matthew Arnold, appropriate for our times \"where ignorant armies clash by night.\"). Just great to find words like BOULDERERS ...and the godfather of American lexicography, Noah WEBSTER. \n\nFirst, a little lesson about chalk and black boards. Now, Jack, get up here! That's right, stand straight. Jack, you wrote that blackboards are \"obsolescent,\" right? Right, you did. What is that behind me? That's correct, Mr. Scherban, it's a chalk board. Now here's a nice piece of chalk. Write on the board 20 times, \"The blackboard is not obsolescent.\" Go on, get started!\n\nNext, to be clear, the chalk of Dover Cliffs is a calcium carbonate. It really was used as chalk in times of yore, but left a rather dusty trail. Modern chalk, akin to gypsum or plaster of Paris, is a calcium sulfate hemihydrate, and the hydrate portion of that equation ensures that modern chalk doesn't leave trails and clouds of dust on use. Early 20th century marketing campaigns often touted \"dustless chalk.\" \n\nEliot & Webster? Surnames of two great American firsts: Noah Webster first published his dictionary in 1806; his expanded version of 1828 is the basis of the one we use today. Eliot's Indian Bible (1661) was the first Bible translated into an indigenous tongue, in the Natick dialect of the Massachusett language.

Surprised there was no mention of Dover Cliffs -- made of the soft white limestone called chalk, lovely place (and fine poem by Matthew Arnold, appropriate for our times \"where ignorant armies clash by night.\"). Just great to find words like BOULDERERS, DIDDLY, DIRTBAG, SICK and the godfather of American lexicography, Noah Webster.\n\nFirst, a little lesson about chalk and black boards. Now, Jack, get up here! That's right, stand straight. Jack, you wrote that blackboards are \"obsolescent,\" right? Right, you did. What is that behind me? That's correct, Mr. Scherban, it's a chalk board. Now here's a nice piece of chalk. Write on the board 20 times, \"The blackboard is not obsolescent.\" Go on, get started!\n\nNext, to be clear, the chalk of Dover Cliffs is a calcium carbonate. It really was used as chalk in times of yore, but left a rather dusty trail. Modern chalk, akin to gypsum or plaster of Paris, is a calcium sulfate hemihydrate, and the hydrate portion of that equation ensures that modern chalk doesn't leave trails and clouds of dust on use. Early 20th century marketing campaigns often touted \"dustless chalk.\" \n\nEliot & Webster? Surnames of two great American firsts: Noah Webster first published his dictionary in 1806; his expanded version of 1828 is the basis of the one we use today.
