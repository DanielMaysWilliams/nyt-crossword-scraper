I'm overstating things, of course, because something like that will never totally disappear. It's a little too cute/romantic for that.

There are a variety of companies/products called SWAK, some using the original initialism, others where it stands for something else. \n\nIf you look at google n-grams, it's quite rare, way down from its peak in 1805. Google search trends only go back to 2004, and are only reported as percentages compared to their peak year within the date range.

Here's how it relates:\n\nClassic Dry Martini:\nOften uses a standard Manzanilla olive, which provides a familiar salty counterpoint to the dry, spirit-forward nature of the drink.\nThe goal is often to keep the olive's flavor relatively neutral, allowing the gin or vodka to shine.\nWet Martini:\nWith its increased vermouth content, a wet martini has a slightly softer, more herbal profile.\nHere, some might choose a slightly more flavorful olive, like a Queen or Castelvetrano, to complement the vermouth's botanicals.\nThe milder nature of the wet martini can handle a more pronounced olive flavor.\nDirty Martini:\nThis variation introduces olive brine into the cocktail, significantly changing the flavor.\nIn a dirty martini, the olive itself becomes less about subtle flavor nuances and more about reinforcing the briny character of the drink.\nTherefore, the olive used in a dirty martini is very important, because the brine that it is contained in, is added to the drink.","createDate":"1740147722","updateDate":"1740208422","approveDate":"1740147722","recommendations":8,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139976444","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8324984908103943}

A dry martini has less vermouth.\n\nNow, one of the most famous old time bar orders was a dry martini, dry as the Sahara, so dry that water molecules are terrified to be anywhere in the area.  But all that means is \"no vermouth\".  It's not like you can add anti-vermouth to move to a drier than dry state.\n\nMartinis do have a lot of variations for such a simple drink--gin and vermouth (old style martinis, not vodka martinis).
