After the Cuyahoga River caught fire in the late 60s, Nixon had to do something politically, so he created the EPA to consolidate all of the actions (often ineffective) of various agencies trying to stem the poisoning of our air, water, and land. Since then, Congress has passed many laws requiring the EPA to enforce them, making it a regulator as well an analyst and advisor.\n\nSince Reagan, the red team has been trying to wrest control away from Congress, centralize it back under the President, and diminish its powers to regulate businesses. For example, back in the 80s, Reagan appointed Anne (Gorsuch) Burford to be its administrator. She slashed the budget and workforce and was credibly accused of intentionally preventing the enforcement of regulations and withholding pollution funds to influence a political campaign. She ended up resigning in disgrace. Her 15 year old son, Neil, reportedly was angry that she resigned and told her she did nothing wrong since she only did what ‚Äúthe President ordered.‚Äù Neil went on to become one of the right wing Supreme Court justices of the tainted Robert‚Äôs court that recently ruled that the President was above the law when acting in his/her official capacity.\n\nSo this isn‚Äôt just Trump. It‚Äôs been going on for 45 years. Four and one half decades over which we could have been gradually and efficiently de-carbonizing our economy.

H. Munro, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirize Edwardian society and culture. He is considered by English teachers and scholars a master of the short story and is often compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker. Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, Munro himself influenced A. A. Milne, No√´l Coward and P. G.
