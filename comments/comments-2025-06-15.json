The word derives from southern Italian dialect.  From Wikipedia:\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary states wop's first known use was in the United States in 1908, and that it originates from the Southern Italian dialectal term guappo, roughly meaning \"dandy\", or \"swaggerer\", derived from the Spanish term guapo, meaning \"good-looking\", \"dandy\", from Latin vappa for \"sour wine\", also \"worthless fellow\".\n\nIn Neapolitan and other Southern Italo-Romance varieties, guappo is pronounced roughly as wahp-po. As word-final vowels in Southern Italian varieties are often realized as /…ô/, guappo would often sound closer to wahpp to anglophones. Guappo historically refers to a type of flashy, boisterous, swaggering, dandy-like man.[6] The word eventually became associated with members of the Camorra and has often been used in the Naples area as a friendly or humorous term of address among men. The word likely transformed into the slur \"(deleted)\" following the arrival of poor Italian immigrants into the United States. The term guappo was especially used by older Italian immigrant males to refer to the younger Italian male immigrants arriving in America. \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wop\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wop</a>","createDate":"1750001981","updateDate":"1750035655","approveDate":"1750001981","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142863266,"parentUserDisplayName":"Xword Junkie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142863649","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6746309399604797}

Learning that I was a WASP was very educational and important in my life. For one thing, I learned that there were aspects to life I didn't have to deal with that my non-WASP friends did. All my religious holidays were recognized by the public schools, for instance--every one of them. And our beliefs were encoded into the blue laws--no alcohol sold on Sundays. There was one Catholic family on our suburban block and they were definitely looked at with suspicion because they could gamble (Bingo) and drink wine (instead of Welch's Grape Juice at communion). \n\nI understood something about racism and racial discrimination and knew we were a pro-integration family, but had assumed that the Anglo-Saxon Protestant cultural practices and beliefs I had grown up with were comfortable for everyone. Because, for the most part, I did not recognize them as a set of practices and beliefs.
