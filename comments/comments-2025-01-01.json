I have been reading and occasionally commenting for 5 years and have often been amused and/ or educated by the comments.\nToday is a good example. I did not know of the dreidle game. My teenage years focused on 'spinning the bottle', not 'spinning the dreidle ' , although there are probably some who did both.\nAlso today, I commented how the answer 'slough' made me think of the various ways 'ough'  is pronounced in English.

I think even for those who know little to nothing about dreidels, the cross-words were so do-able that it could be fun for everyone. Myself, as a rabbi's daughter who went to a Jewish Day School from K-9, the theme answers were a piece of cake. Or latke. Although, I didn't notice the C-L-A-Y aspect till the column/Comments! Nicely done!\n\nIn playing piano for Ballet class, I found great fun in playing holiday 'themes' for as many holidays as possible. Fats Waller's birthday 5/21 being a big one. In December I'd play a lot of Christmas music, including the The Chipmunks Song which is actually quite a lovely melody w/great harmonies, and I'd throw in Hanukkah songs too. NEVER the dreidel song though, that song is the very definition of earworm. Who wrote it, lol? It makes \"99 Bottles of Beer\" sound like Mozart in comparison. But there are some nice Hanukkah songs I'd play, e.g Hanukkah O Hanukkah and Maoz Tzur. Not the dreaded dreidel song though! (in voice typing just now \"Hanukkah\" became both \"Panic\" and \"Honda\", w/dreidel as \"dreadful\"! Lol).\n\n[Becca Blather Zone]\nFor me the best dance-class 🎶holiday was Halloween, which for me was the entire month of October. Not just Danse Macabre or Spooky or Love Potion #9 but also great film music like my medley of Young Frankenstein theme with the gorgeous theme from Gods and Monsters. And spooky improvs with lots of 'tritones' (augmented 4ths— \"Ma-💥REEEE💥-[ah]\", very spooky).\n< /BeccaBlather-Zone >\n\n[cont'd] >>","createDate":"1735769297","updateDate":"1735787141","approveDate":"1735769300","recommendations":7,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138689083","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9475252628326416}

I nodded gravely, but that's a perception based on high school English, where a student learns just one word. English may have a simple structure, but it's huge because it's a bunch of languages just stuck together.

This had letters on its faces corresponding to the first letters of the Latin words for \"nothing\", \"everything\", \"half\" and \"put in\", which determined the outcome after each spin. From Ireland the teetotum was brought to Germany, where it was called a trendel, and was eventually adopted by Yiddish-speaking Jews.

I think I only got one minor burn, once.\n\nWell since I've blathered into three comments (lazy, self-indulgent New Year's Day) I may as well fill up the extra available space here with links to three Hanukkah songs: Adam Sandler's classic \"Chanukah Song\", the Levees \"Hanukkah Rocks\"— which is just sort of gently sweet but for some reason I recall really liking at the time— and a Tom Lehrer song I'd forgotten about, typical greatness, \"Hanukkah in Santa Monica\". Enjoy. Happy Hanukkah and Happy New Year all, and any other festivities you celebrate. (Eighth Day of Christmas? Kwanzaa?    Festivus?)\n\n🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎\nAdam Sandler The Chanukah Song\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qX-GwNNMXwU?si=qJNg9SUCHOFae5E5\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/qX-GwNNMXwU?si=qJNg9SUCHOFae5E5</a>\n\nThe Leevees Hanukkah Rocks\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/S6sfMmzAnxc?si=lkaiRCo4Oxj25FUF\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/S6sfMmzAnxc?si=lkaiRCo4Oxj25FUF</a>\n\nTom Lehrer Hanukkah in Santa Monica\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LslsgH3-UFU?si=9Kwel97lGiTcsX6t\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/LslsgH3-UFU?si=9Kwel97lGiTcsX6t</a>\n🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎🕎\n\n^[I know, not a true Hanukkiah emoji, vott can you do]","createDate":"1735769875","updateDate":"1735787293","approveDate":"1735769879","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138689124,"parentUserDisplayName":"Becca","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138689196","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6995972990989685}

I hadn't noticed that the Hanukkah menorah as it posted is perfect! On my emoji menu it has *seven* candles, three to the left and three to the right of the center shamash. Which is not an actual Hanukkah menorah. BUT that yellow 7-candle menorah on its white background transmuted into a white genuine 9-candle hanukkia on a purple background in my post, but I didn't notice at the time. Most of the smiley faces, grinny/ laughy faces and other emojis are also slightly different onscreen on this site than the emoji keyboard shows. This happens on some websites, not on others. (I wish I could share screenshots here, showing the slight-to-radical differences as they post).\n\nSo, regarding my footnote about the emojis— as Emily Litella might say, \"Never mind\"! No need to seek a rabbi for his/her sage wisdom about the menorah… they'd probably be very confused, and then call a conference of rabbis to examine exactly what was wrong with those pictured menorahs… time better spent, I would think, parsing what are appropriate Hanukkah foods to use for the Strands puzzle, probably.","createDate":"1735797153","updateDate":"1735797157","approveDate":"1735797157","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138689282,"parentUserDisplayName":"Becca","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138692939","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5299575924873352}
