But the court ruled that, since Certs did not contain anti-bacterial ingredients, they were, indeed, simply a candy mint.

Took an age to untangle that.\n\nThe constructor seems to have been exposed to different stereotypes from those I know, so [Pirate's lack, stereotypically] and [Stereotypical tattoo on poker player's arm] were both a bit meta for me: I had to ask myself, \"What stereotypes might someone invent for these people?\"\nThere does seem to be a heck of a lot of twaddle about pirates and Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) online, so I guess it is an actual stereotype.
