I was no solver at the time, and I need someone to explain it. \n\nOne example (not exactly what was there):\n\nClue: Lamotherw \n\nAnswer:  mother in law, no spaces of course. \n\nThe word \"mother\" was in the word \"law.\"\n\nThere were a number of clues just like that.

But I would say that those clues were very tricky, and probably impossible for the uninitiated. \n\nLastly, as others have said multiple times, I would remind the new solvers that learning the various potential tricks and getting a feel for the many repeated answers (Ado, Ego, Errs, SSN, Amp, etc.) helps tremendously, but it takes a bit of time to do that.\n\nTada!\n\nTata...","createDate":"1718905053","updateDate":"1718924313","approveDate":"1718905056","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134029143","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8415372371673584}

Just one example - A Sunday from 3/20/1983 with the title - \"Now you C it.\" Some sample theme answers: \n\nALLOFTHEWILD\nRIMEDOESNOTPAY\nOLDSHOULDER\nSNAKEHARMER\nMOUNTAINLIMBER\nARTSANDRAFTS \n\nAnd her other puzzles are just as amusing.

Personally, I like the flavor of an all-butter pie crust, but a recipe with Crisco will give you a flakier result, which is more desirable by some bakers (and some pie-consumers) in some (many) cases. Also, a pie-crust made with Crisco will have a milder flavor profile, which may be desired if you don’t want the flavor of the crust to clash with or overpower your pie filling.\n\nCrisco is also useful in other recipes, again mostly for the texture and consistency of the resulting baked good. \n\n\n\n .:.:.:.:.\n\n.:.:.:.:.:.","createDate":"1718868080","updateDate":"1719057380","approveDate":"1718868083","recommendations":21,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134015718,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jannicut","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134017620","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6893093585968018}

Along with trickier clues, there is usually a twist of some sort, anything from rebuses to hidden letters to spelling backwards to letters or words outside the grid. Many of us look forward to the challenge of a Thursday puzzle, to figure out the trick as well as fill in the grid. It's good exercise for the brain.\n\nMany of the words you're complaining about are common in crosswords. STENO(grapher), 122 previous uses, 'ELIhu' (Yale) was used on June 9th and in April, ELI's been used over 50 times for this type clue\n\nMonk (10) and Roger (>200) are more common as answers, but Roger as a clue has been used 18 previous times with similar answers.\n\nOn the less used side were 'mens rea' and 'Dallas' as clued, but crosses were fair and weren't terribly difficult to fill in. 'Wild yeast' was explained in Deb's column.\n\nIf you know what a pentagon is, 'pentad' is not hard to come up with, even if not that commonly used.\n\nToday's trick was a mild one, and fairly easy to figure out, since the names to be exchanged were simple, and circled at that.

Warehouses often have a \"will call\" desk where people can pick up merchandise. Typically they've already paid via the company's website, but sometimes they use an established line of credit. It's useful if the customer lives relatively near the website; it's a way to get what they need quickly, without having to wait for it to be shipped or delivered via a company truck. \n\nI've worked at several warehouse will-calls, because I always tended to volunteer for the stuff nobody else wants to do. It takes patience. Often the customer is already stressed out and in a hurry, so working that job often involves getting yelled at for things you have no control over.

I knew E-BIKE and MOPED didn't fit, but the answer did register -- sadly. \n\nATVs are altogether illegal in NYC. But that doesn't prevent people from owning them, and riding them on highways! Believe me, I live directly over an expressway -- I've seen it all... \n\nI won't belabor (most of) the other answers you mentioned, as you requested. But I can't help but say, living in the theater capital of the US, that a Will Call window -- and purchase language about picking up tickets \"at the Will Call\" -- is absolutely 100% correct, and has been longer than I've been alive. It may be that the term comes across as a verbal DOOK, and I get that. But like other DOOKS, it's a good one to learn -- especially if you ever visit NYC and go to a Broadway show!   :)","createDate":"1718891520","updateDate":"1718915430","approveDate":"1718891523","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134021280,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ιασων","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134021847","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4645105302333832}
