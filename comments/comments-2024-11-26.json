I like how it came on strong and tough, a little bumpy, then settled down into a nice even idle,  like starting a muscle car and waiting for it to warm up. Auto-fill, what a great idea! I was even surprised the clue for ETTE wasn't [Ending for Cor- and towl]. \n\nNot one but two McDonald's answers. Yikes.  Better watch those carbs and calories there, bub, you want to stay your normal chiseled self, dontcha?\n\nAdmittedly, I was held up right at the beginning, as I pondered the many things that might be artificial at half of all NFL stadiums. KNEES, I thought, thinking half the people in any given NFL stadium probably had artificial knees. Seemed a little high a ratio. Plus, along came KNEES in the puzzle. Same with NAILS, although I would say that many of the Steelers fans here, especially but not solely the females, have artificial nails. And other parts of their bodies, too, shall we say. Also half the ODORS one smells in an NFL stadium are indeed artificial, sprays, perfumes and colognes, the frying of synthetic foodstuffs in synthetic oil in one of Ray Kroc's outlets.  But the other half of the odors make up for it with their natural, organic, reality-based stenches.  And half the WHOOP sounds you hear are artificial, just ROTE noises that don't come from a sincere, joyous passion for the game. You don't need ESP to tell a real whoop from a phony one.  These thoughts took a while, as I tarried at 1-A.

I also liked that EDGE begins on one.\n\nBut what I really really liked – loved, actually – was [Afraid not?] for GUTSY. Yes, it’s a lovely pun on a common phrase.  But it also immediately reminded me of another “afraid not” pun that immediately came to mind when I saw the clue – a joke punchline, as in the following: \n\nA piece of string walks into a bar and walks up to the counter.  The bartender says, “Sorry mate, we don’t serve pieces of strong in here, get lost.  Upset, the piece of string walks out the door.  A sudden thought strikes him.  He ties himself in a knot and messes his hair up.  He walks back into the bar and approaches the counter.  The bartender says, “Aren’t you that piece of string  from before…?”  “No,” says the piece of string.  “I’m a frayed knot.”\n\nSo, this simple clue/answer of [Afraid not?] for GUTSY thrust me into a dizzying pun whirlwind – a phrase famously punned upon being used as a pun itself! – which had me wowing for a spell.  \n\nThank you for that, Killian, congratulations on your debut, and what a great springboard for the day your puzzle was for me!","createDate":"1732626271","updateDate":"1732687017","approveDate":"1732626275","recommendations":55,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137887317","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9141387343406677}

Finally saw APPS and learned about ANDOR.","createDate":"1732612372","updateDate":"1732684879","approveDate":"1732612375","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137880302,"parentUserDisplayName":"Killian Olson","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137883921","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9102856516838074}
