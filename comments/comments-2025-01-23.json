Apparently, we were meant to learn the basics of homeownership here, then move on to something bigger and more challenging. \n\nI guess we didn’t learn our lessons, because we’re still here. (Actually, we just really like our house.) But in that spirit, I think this puzzle would make a great “starter rebus”. It’s intuitive and easy to grasp. If the inability to squeeze SEE SPOT RUN into 15A causes a little uncertainty, having the inability to squeeze NEPOTISM into the *very next clue* is like a gentle guiding hand. And then the circles…\n\nThis is not to say I thought the puzzle was too easy, or boring. On the contrary, I thought it was a fun drive. Having the potholes scattered among the various thoroughfares was a clever bonus. And the clues were definitely challenging enough to be engaging. \n\nThis puzzle probably won’t sway anyone who is already determined to hate rebuses. But for anyone else, and especially those who are new to the concept, I think this is a great example to show just how much fun it can be to navigate a rebus puzzle.

Crossword Class sounds like the name of an avantgarde music band 😀\n\nI enjoyed the puzzle in general, and caught on to the rebus instantly thanks to MESO(POT)AMIA. I needed quite a few lookups though, as the grid relied on proper names and trivia to a greater extent than I'd like. I also only got the Dick and Jane (whatever that is) line because it was a themed entry. \n\nYesterday @Tom asked me why I wrote of the fall of Polish \"communism\" with those quotation marks, but because of time zones by then I was sound asleep and only saw the question today: I thought I'd reply here.\n\n@Tom \n\nIt was just a dictatorship, an oligarchy, posing as a communist utopia. It was not communism. If anything, it was closer to socialism, but wasn't really socialist, either. Almost everything about the system and its regime was fake, and almost everybody over here knew it. The great absurdist director Stanisław Bareja captured the spirit of \"communist\" Poland perfectly in his grotesque comedies. Here's his wiki entry, with kinks to his works: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis</a>%C5%82aw_Bareja\n\nHowever, I'm not sure how any of that can be understandable to somebody who has not experienced that world themselves, even as a child, like I did. Even my wife's sister, who was born in 1990, after the fall of \"communism\", and 10 years later than my wife an I, doesn't get what Bareja's films and series are really about.\n\nSo please, take my word for it 🤪","createDate":"1737613516","updateDate":"1737695982","approveDate":"1737613517","recommendations":40,"replyCount":11,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139192510","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6172991991043091}

The first, by Tracy Gray (10/22/15), had a different gimmick, and a terrific one at that, worth checking out.\n\nTracy’s lovely gimmick didn’t include the potholes interrupting traffic arteries, like today’s  does – a terrific touch, IMO.  I also like that the potholes are circled, because, to me at least, the tops of holes are stereotypically circular.\n\nMy fill-in was enhanced by appealing words and phrases: BARFLY, PETAL, DREAM ON, COME UNDONE.  Also, sweet to see BEEGEE and TEEPEE, words made of letter sounds.\n\nI love the idea of a group of people making a puzzle, all motivated by making it the best it can be, and guided by that ethos, brainstorming the theme, best answers, and best clues.  \n\nEvery J.A.S.A. puzzle I’ve done has felt like it has been made like this.  It’s a great credit not only to the talents of the students, but to the teacher, who fosters that best-it-can-be climate.\n\nSo, bravo to you all, congratulations on being published NYT constructors, and thank you for a smile-producing outing today!","createDate":"1737636644","updateDate":"1737700951","approveDate":"1737636645","recommendations":43,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139196118","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9048295021057129}

Although I couldn't have expressed it at the time, I recognized the texts as didactic and not meant to reflect real speech.  Together with Mrs. Howell's phonics worksheets (dittos at that time), they catapulted me into reading very effectively.  By the end of first grade I could read the easier children's classic novels and the \"color\" fairy books with no help at all.  Very soon I was a full fledged reader whose library card was never idle.  As an English teacher, I wish more children were taught to read using this practical combination of \"see and say\" and phonics.  On another note:  Have you ever read a novel where the characters spoke as people do in real life?  \"Run, Spot, run\"  is literary genius by comparison.","createDate":"1737663103","updateDate":"1737687576","approveDate":"1737663104","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139194384,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139213398","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8751010298728943}
