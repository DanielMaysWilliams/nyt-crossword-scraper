I'm only kicking myself for not getting CORETTASCOTT faster with fewer crossings. That was awesome!  If I'd have done better in the middle faster, I probably would have, but I worked from the top down and then had to work from the bottom up.

It's always a good reminder that I have to keep up on that too, instead of being obsessed with the crossword archives etc.\n\nI figured it out of course, but \"moving to BCC\" is not a phrase I've heard of in all of my many email dealings. I'm not a big fan of BCCing personally, as I've seen it too often used to spite someone.

In a tournament, of course, you have to complete your solve with no assistance, and experienced solvers can regularly complete a crossword without assistance.\n\nFor others, though, the satisfaction of solving comes from a solve achieved however it takes to solve it.  They may not perceive the concept of a streak the same way.    Hopefully, at some point those solvers will become proficient enough to always solve every puzzle without any kind of help, but for some, that day may never come.  Why not allow them the right to celebrate a streak?\n\nIf you watch a major league baseball game and a pitcher throws a no-hitter, that's quite an achievement.  Only a handful of those occur a season across the entire schedule.  But if a high-school pitcher (who, BTW, only play a seven-inning game) throws a no-hitter, shouldn't he be allowed to celebrate?\n\nShouldn't a weekend golfer be able to celebrate a round far below his handicap?\n\nAs former NYT puzzle editor Will Weng (not Shortz) said in his valedictory article:  And to the solvers I bequeath a few theories about puzzles.

Great and Little Corn islands lie 50 and 59 miles (80 and 95 km), respectively, east-northeast of Bluefields.\n\nThe islands were leased to the United States by Nicaragua under the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty, signed in 1914 and ratified in 1916, for use as a naval base to protect the then-proposed Nicaraguan interoceanic canal. This lease was terminated in 1971. Except for building a lighthouse on Little Corn, the United States did not take over the land covered by the lease.
