Fair and fun and silly, and with the chewier entries having very sussable crosses. It had personality. And I like the theme.\n\nI only got around to my first martini in the early 2000s or 2010s. My (not very frequent) drinks were Kahlua-and-Cream, maybe a Screwdriver, or a Whiskey Sour, and I was game to try any Kahlua-adjacent drinks. Wasn't a fan of gin, but then realized it was *tonic* I really didn't like. Anyway, one day after buying some fun thrift-store cocktail glasses I mixed my first martini for myself. Beefeater's gin, olives, a teensy bit of vermouth, very gently stirred. I liked it!\n\nNo ice: I'd just fill a few mini bottles with gin (pints or airplane-tiny-sized) & keep 'em in the freezer, where the gin stayed liquid but cold.\n\nWhen I solved today's puzzle I couldn't figure out what that red thing was in the picture. I thought, who puts a cherry in a martini?! when I realized it must be the pimiento. I LOVE lots of olives in my martini, but I use the good fresh meaty green olives that don't have pimentos. I skewer about four big fat olives on a stirrer and they're a main feature of the martini.\n\nI consider a \"dirty martini\" me putting a little splash of the oil that comes w/the good olives into the glass. Especially if it's olive-bar olives. Not the brine from a standard yucky green-olives jar. It's been a while but I've recently thought of fixing myself a martini, I think it was when I was reorganizing my thrift-store glass collection >>","createDate":"1712261729","updateDate":"1712275133","approveDate":"1712261732","recommendations":6,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132324691","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9379387497901917}

Each July, about halfway through the season, baseball pauses a few days for the All-Star Game, in which the best players in the two leagues face off against one another.  The night before, they have a separate event called the Home Run Derby, in which some of the best power hitters engage in a contest in which the winner is the one who hits it over the fence the most times.  Each player brings his own \"pitcher\" with him, usually a coach who lobs one easy pitch after another so that the batter has the best chance of hitting it out.\n\nThis contest is quite popular, but is not quite baseball.
