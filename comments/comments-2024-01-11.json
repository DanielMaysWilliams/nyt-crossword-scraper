Thank you!\n\nI loved this puzzle. And I mean *loved*it.\n\nAt first, I was all over the grid, filling in everything I was sure of, so I ended up with DASK in the SE, not knowing what to do with it until I came upon Y=X. \nAha! \nFrom then on, DAS KAPITAL and all the other themers rolled off the tip of the stylus, unhindered.\n\nI appreciate that this puzzle was on the easier side. It allowed me to deliberately slow down after filling in the answers, for the sheer pleasure of taking in and admiring the cluing. \nThis gave me a much richer and more satisfying experience of solving.\n\nAs for the music in the grid, despite adoring George Michael and having a blast with DEVO's \"Whip It,\" it was THE SHOW MUST GO ON that gave me the soundtrack for this puzzle.\n\nHere is Queen with this very poignant video that always moves me, seeing that the phenomenal Freddie Mercury was already very ill yet courageously pressing on because, well, because THE SHOW MUST GO ON... \nLegendary man.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/t99KH0TR-J4?feature=shared\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/t99KH0TR-J4?feature=shared</a>","createDate":"1704948018","updateDate":"1705176827","approveDate":"1704948020","recommendations":24,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130381598","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9662705063819885}

It illustrates two of my most deeply held puzzle mayims:  \n\n1) A trick puzzle is almost always trickier when you put the trick in the clue rather than the answer.\n\n2) A one-time-only rebus can be trickier than a recurring rebus because it's so unexpected.\n\nThis had both elements.  And for me, the \"Aha Moment\" was huge.\n\nBut -- and I imagine you'll pretty much all agree -- the surrounding fill was much easier than usual for a Thursday.  I think I would have preferred it quite a bit harder, but I can't be sure.  I can only solve the puzzle I solved and not the imaginary puzzle I didn't solve.  So I'm wondering: If you combined the trickiness of the theme with challenging fill all around it, would that have made the puzzle more frustrating than pleasurable? \n\nI don't know.  I adored the theme, but I sort of feel I got off pretty easy today.","createDate":"1704983242","updateDate":"1705002566","approveDate":"1704983244","recommendations":19,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130386596","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8298044800758362}

He wrote a fairly long and, in my opinion, well thought out list of suggestions for commenters in this forum. It included basic stuff like try to spend a minute or two researching a topic before posting. And when possible try to read previous posts in case the subject has already been extensively discussed. I know many have limited amounts of time to devote to this, but a lot of his suggestions I thought were appropriate. Unfortunately someone made a pretty brazen attack on him, prompting multiple flags of that someone's post. The end result was that the entire thread was deleted. I had been under the impression that if the OP is flagged enough, the whole thread goes. I didn’t know that a reply to a post, if flagged, could nix the whole thread. I guess we’ll never know exactly what happened, but I feel bad that many likely missed out on seeing Steve L’s constructive suggestions.","createDate":"1705003339","updateDate":"1705010564","approveDate":"1705003342","recommendations":6,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130395287","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-11","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6382095813751221}

I kept putting 'E' in there as in the past the first letter of it has always worked (mobile, Android). I never even considered '=' as I've never seen a non-alphanumeric symbol in a puzzle, though I should have thought to put in 'EQUALS'. I had to come to the blog to understand.\n\nI don't know what it is, but whenever a puzzle is a rebus, even after finishing it, I didn't have a good time.

Then came the lightbulb and aha! moment wherein I squealed with glee. Suddenly, I could fill in CAT PEOPLE, THE SHOW MUST GO ON and BRAZILIAN (my favourite clue/answer BTW) and the puzzle cracked wide open. It's for this reason that Thursdays are my favourite puzzles of the week. \n\n\n*although I knew there was a rebus, after I filled it in and didn't get my gold star, I had to come to the column to find my 2 errors\n\nFlower girl? could be a ROLE someone plays, and al equal is close enough. \n\nLikewise, ACHE fit the answer, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why editors were concerned with STELE.\n\nStill, this is my favourite puzzle of the year so far, and I'm going to bed with a big grin on my face. My goal this year is 366 gold stars. 11 down, 355 to go.","createDate":"1705041962","updateDate":"1705477544","approveDate":"1705041965","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130405378","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.807641327381134}

And one can often appreciate the theme more if one isn’t banging one’s head against the wall for the rest of the puzzle. The fact that the cluing was kind in the rest of the grid is one of the factors that allowed the enigma of the theme to unfold and stand out more clearly. \n\nIn other words, the contrast helped to heighten the effectiveness of the theme. Rather than just feeling stymied in general, I was mystified by the themers in particular, which gave the aha moment more oomph. \n\nTo be clear, I often enjoy being stymied by really tough cluing. But perhaps that feeling is best savored in a themeless, when it’s the main point of the puzzle.

I hope our coastal Maine folks are OK. \n\nI have spent a fair amount of time in Castine, and used to sail out of there. Eaton's Boatyard, a long-standing institution in the town, was heavily damaged. Denett's Wharf, a place I've enjoyed many a meal, was engulfed and has suffered major damage. Many other coastal communities have had similar damage.\n\nThe dock facilities on Monhegan were seriously damaged. Last I heard, there won't be any ferry access (it's really a small mail boat) until tomorrow at the earliest. Camps have been washed into the ocean, waterfront facilities -- parks, roads, etc -- all damaged by the high tide that coincided with the peak of the storm. The causeway to Deer Isle was inundated. Fortunately, it was not damaged, so when the waters receded it was re-opened. \n\nAnd we are getting a repeat storm on Saturday, when the tide will be even higher. \n\nI don't think much media outside of Maine is covering this.

'Cause of Irritated Eyes' = BAD BREAKUP? Sure, that makes sense, becauze you're likely to be crying. 'Many lovers' = CAT PEOPLE? OK, I guess it's a reference to cat hoarders, which is a bit off, but not beyond the pale for misleading clues. 'Mayim of entertainment' = THE SHOW MUST GO ON? I've never heard of Mayim; maybe they say that a lot. 'Way down in the nether regions' = BRAZILLIAN? It's a term related to the bikini area, so, again, not that off for a misleading puzzle clue. All of theze and Y=X I solved with only a few crossing entries to help, becauze they make sense with the clues as written. The only \"theme entry\" that makes more sense once you know the theme is DAS KAPITAL. What a useless theme.","createDate":"1704985729","updateDate":"1705025362","approveDate":"1704985732","recommendations":6,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130387809","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-11","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5439112186431885}
