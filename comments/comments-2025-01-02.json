I'm told his books occasionally feature self-hating gay characters. But as the puzzle says (good advice in general): LET IT GO. \n\nPossible good new year's resolution, too.

Is it a baseball thing?\n\nThis was a pretty cool puzzle, themed around one of the curious aspects of the English language. I did not know the quip but it was easy enough to get with some crosses.\n\nIn Polish only the letter F produces an F sound. In general in Polish there is almost always only one way to write down a word for it to be pronounced a certain way. Very few of our words produce sounds that could be written down differently, the chief example being jabłko (apple), which sounds as if it were spelled japko [yapp-ko]. We also have some homophones (but much, much fewer than in English), eg. buk (beech tree), bóg (god) and Buk (the river Bug) all sound the same (it is a sound like your word book).\n \nI looked up the whole row third from the bottom: EMIL, SNEAD, ALER (I appreciate an explanation of that entry in the blog. I thought it had something to do with ale 🤣), as well as Michelle Obama's mother. Other then that I needed no outside help.\n\nI was prepared to enter F/PH into the themed squares but I'm glad the much more convenient option of going for an F was accepted by the app. That made for a smoother user experience.","createDate":"1735801553","updateDate":"1735856088","approveDate":"1735801557","recommendations":11,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138693292","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7994853258132935}

I love getting gotten good like that. \n\nToday, I was gotten good again, but in a different way – by being hit by the unexpected.  After seeing [Start of a quip by comic Steven Wright], I assumed this was simply a quip puzzle.  \n\nEvery quip puzzle I’ve seen has a quote to crack and nothing theme-wise beyond that.  So today, when it became clear that there was something else going on – and it was related to the quip – that was a wow.  Here was something new in crosswords!  I just had to stop for a moment, dwell on how clever it was for Robert to come up with that, and nod with respect.\n\nOh, the solve gave me some lovely resistance, and had lovely touches.  One that especially tickled me was [Achilles, for two], because whenever there's an [x, for two] clue, that “x” is always two items, not one, such as in [“Iliad” and “Odyssey”, for two] for EPICS.  Always.  That’s another crossword first in this puzzle.\n\nHappy surprises and plenty of riddle cracking for me today, Robert.

I didn't find anything nonsensical, so if the OP had simply asked for an explanation on any clue, I'd have been happy to provide it.  (See my comment to Andzrej about MEN ON.)\n\nThe OP also shows a gaping misunderstanding of how construction works, or they wouldn't be throwing around \"lazy and unfair\".  The construction of a puzzle with this kind of gimmick requires a great amount of work, more so than that of a regular puzzle.\n\nAnd worst of all, that snarky \"Please do better\" at the end usually indicates that the solver is just not up to the task.  There are very few puzzles here that are so bad that they require major changes.  But there are a lot of solvers who just aren't up for the task.

Now let’s go to Baseball 102. When no one is on base, you say the bases are empty. The opposite is that there are MEN ON (or a man on) base.

When the bases are empty, the pitcher doesn’t have to worry about this. \n\nBases loaded means there’s a runner on every base, so it’s a subset of MEN ON.","createDate":"1735804562","updateDate":"1735856108","approveDate":"1735804566","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138693292,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138693492","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8597232699394226}

When he goes too far (for example, stops completely mid-kick to then kick in another direction), the pentaly kick may be declared invalid (I appologize to football fans for my language, which is probably not professional enough.

I don’t think they should labor under that restriction. We read, write, and talk about bad people all the time in real life, sometimes mentioning them in the same sentences with the good. Imposing such a burden would be especially onerous because we do not always agree on the good and the bad. For example, a strong case can be made against 43D (WILSON), although I won’t do so here, but his resting place made for an excellent clue. On the crossing issue, 32A was great in part because the subject’s first name is likely to be on the edge of memory for many of us, not too easy but not too obscure: “Oh right, I think it’s an M name, but what? Margaret, no, Marilyn, no …” Perfect, and all the more because the name MARIAN inspired me, as usual, to sing as much as I can remember of “Madam Librarian,” which amuses the dog. I gave zero thought to 21D except insofar as the A I’d filled in helped me think of it. To conclude, at long last, I would argue that the enjoyment of crossword puzzles is affected more by repetitiveness than anything else, which often can’t be helped, but it would be worse if we demanded that entries be policed for proper names or chance crossings with unpleasant associations for some.

I want to believe this story is true, although I doubt it:\n\nAccording to Susan Orlean, author of Rin Tin Tin: The Life and The Legend, Jannings was not actually the winner of the first best actor vote, but the runner-up. While researching her book, Orlean thought she discovered that it was in fact Rin Tin Tin, the German Shepherd dog, one of the biggest movie stars of his time, who won the vote. The Academy, however, worried about not being taken seriously if they gave the first Oscar to a dog, chose to award the Oscar to the human runner-up.[5] However, this story has been labeled as absolutely not true by other sources.[6][7]","createDate":"1735854937","updateDate":"1735896587","approveDate":"1735854940","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138693538,"parentUserDisplayName":"NMarie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138712527","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.604341983795166}
