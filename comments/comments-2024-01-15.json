In the fifth grade I performed the FTROOP theme song in front of the class when it was my turn for “show and tell.”  Thankfully my musical taste improved somewhat over the years.  Sadly I can still recall the lyrics (or at least most of them) to this day (ditto for the Gilligan’s Island and Addams Family themes).

Cute theme and a smooth solve; not quite a Monday record but close. \n\nI did come here wondering about a different theme on this particular day. Nope - but thought it was a nice touch (wonder if it was coincidental) to at least see Arthur ASHE,  MALIAOBAMA and... especially ROSA Parks in the theme.\n\nOn that note - went and did an extended answer history search for another name. Well. MARTINLUTHERKING is 16 letters. Add JUNIOR and it's 22 letters. I could go on and on about that but, in brief... the ONLY appearance of anything close to the full name was in a Sunday puzzle from February 19, 1984 by Bert H. Kuse. The answer in that one was: \n\nMARTINLKINGJR\n\nSome other theme answers in that one included: \n\nROYWILKINS\nJESSEOWENS\nWEBDUBOIS\nHARRIETTUBMAN\nPAULROBESON\n\nBut then I stumbled across one of the most amazing puzzles I've ever seen.

We here are waiting to see if we are safely south of the weather front--my sincere hope for both today and tomorrow.  The temp is bad enough.  (I've spoken with the sasanqua camellias and wished them well.)\n\nVery nice Monday puzzle.  PAC always delivers!  \nThe sole nod to the date is the name of ROSA Parks; as Heather Cox Richardson notes, heroism is often shown in quiet ways, when someone simply stands firm for what is right.  (Her erudite near-daily \"Letters from an American\" are free.  They are very affirming.)  \n\nDebating about listening again to MLK's \"Dream\" speech.  It always brings tears.   Meanwhile, our Guv has cut off the food program for needy children and continues to reject Medicaid expansion--both deperately needed.  Give me strength.","createDate":"1705330668","updateDate":"1705847526","approveDate":"1705330671","recommendations":20,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130464386","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4779426157474518}
