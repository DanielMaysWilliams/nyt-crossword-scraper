Either EDDIES or PONDERS was Very Wrong and I had no idea which.  I also had EEL instead of ELM for the \"slippery\" thing.  If I had just known ENYA -- but of course I didn't.  Not until DOG GROOMER started to fill in did I change PONDERS to NOODLES.  (PONDERS is better, AGREE?)\n\nNow for \"checking\" vs. \"cheating\" [TM]:\n\nI didn't Google the beer directly.  I had what looked like it might be NATTY something-or-other, so I typed \"beer: NATTY\" into Google and both NATTY ICE and NATTY BOH came up.

This is the strategy I use when I think I'm about to be stuck: instead of typing in only the answers I'm ink-sure about, which is normally what I do, I try to relax down to only needing to be pencil-sure 😅 Not easy for me, but often enough it's the key to melting an otherwise totally frozen chunk. \n\nLoved STAIRMASTER, SCREAMQUEEN (and I wish the original clue had stuck, especially given how often we're entering EKE or EKING!), and DOGGROOMER.
