Because the trick was flagged by the grey squares I caught on right away — sort of.  I entered the appropriate note as a rebus in the topmost of the themed answers and when no rebus seemed appropriate for the lower answer, I just entered the second letter of the note.  I thought the gimmick was a bit awkward, but eventually figured out that by bending the notes, as say MILES Davis might, it actually worked just fine.  \n\nI had never heard the eely pun based on THATSAMORE, which tickled me no end.\n\nOff topic, but a short while back there was a discussion here about hot tea no longer being free at Chinese restaurants.

Glad others liked this one but it wasn’t for me. It relied to an unusual extent on a particular area of trivia, in this case musical trivia: names of singers, songs, musicals; lines from musicals; etc. (Yes, I realize that the themers were all musically inclined: that was a chief source of the problem.) To me, that made it feel very specific and a bit of a slog.\n\nAt the same time, I thought the theme was a bit light — especially because the notes didn’t come in order. The whole point of the sol-fa scale is that it’s a *scale* — not just a jumble of syllables. Hence to really sing (pun intended), the themes should have appeared in order: do-re-mi-fa-so(l)-la-ti.\n\nI realize that putting the scale in order would have made this significantly harder to construct, but it also would have made for a much tighter theme and better puzzle. \n\nThe combination of overreliance on trivia and an underdeveloped theme (again with the musical puns!) leaves me feeling this was only so-so.

But thanks to The Sound of Music, and guessing TUXE-DO, I was quickly able to fill in all the shaded squares in the puzzle with the descending scale degrees. This helped immensely as I finished the solve.\n\nMy final hold-up was the cross of 38A and 33D. My \"tech exec\" had unbeknownst to me produced a word quite inappropriate for the NYT.

My first reaction when simply looking over the clues, before I filled in even a single letter, was that this was going to be impossible, filled with musical arcana that would be way too obscure for me. I even got a little huffy about it, and thought of Kincaid of San Diego's drive-by comment a day or two ago (something about boring and awful and he'd rather thaw his freezer, garnering a hundred likes from the like-minded). But then I got to work, hammering in a piton here and there and commencing the climb. Eventually I summited. I caught on at Wiz Khalifa and once I got the trick, boom! Though I can't understand why a three-cornered hat is not a tricorne, but I'll look into that and get back to you. Hats off to Mr. Ellison!\n\nAs someone who tends toward the organic (in the metaphorical sense, I'm not talking about Whole Foods aisles), and who thinks computers & technology have caused us -- humans -- to radically mentally regress as a species, I'm troubled by the increasing reliance on technology to create puzzles, and (irrationally or not) fear that handing over 50% of puzzle creation to a \"fill engine\" will lead to a general atrophying of that part of the creative brain responsible for the fill. On the one hand, Mr. Ellison is a genius for building such an engine. On the other, it's a death knell. The cat's out of the bag with AI: that's what's next, right?

It took a while to click, mainly because I use SI and not TI as the seventh degree of the scale.
