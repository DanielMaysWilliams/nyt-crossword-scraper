The only real hiccup I had came from the Kinks song, but not for the reason everyone else is expecting. It was my first theme solve of the 3, so I hadn’t yet realized how narrow the theme was — I saw “funny transcribing of repetition in song” rather than “repeated syllables in particular.” So rather than typing La-La-La-La-Lola part of the song, I jumped to “Lola, L-O-L-A Lola” with virtually no fill to guide me.\n\nThose alternating O’s and A’s in the NW probably cost me 5 minutes of extra solve time to notice and fix. I’d blown through the horizontal fill in the NW so quickly I didn’t even notice the vertical fill was busted (MOOT, ERO) — at a glance they seemed like plausible solves to *something*.","createDate":"1707282468","updateDate":"1707373823","approveDate":"1707282470","recommendations":12,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130989627","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8701107501983643}

The unknown lyrics were easy to figure out though once I had some crosses.\n\nAs almost always, some trivia got me and I had to look it up, especially in the naticky crossing of DEAF and GIFS: naticky because I had no idea what CODA was - you Americans you and your pathological love of acronyms! - and I've never heard of Slack, so it was a cruel way to clue my beloved GIFS (I've had entire conversations consisting solely of gifs, but on Signal, the non-spying IM app). I also had to Google PIERRE (I have never read War and Peace, which is on me I guess; my mom loved 19th century Russian literature, but she always told me one has to read it in Russian to fully appreciate it, and since I never learned that language, I passed on the books; I knew from experience how much English literature lost in translation and figured the same was true of Russian) and ADWEEK (are we really supposed to know the titles of trade mags?).
