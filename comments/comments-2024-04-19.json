(I wonder if anyone noticed when I changed my handle slightly a year or two back. I did so in response to comments made, not about my handle, but about an entry in a puzzle that raised some hackles. I didn't agree that much with the criticisms, but I saw how the same criticism could be made regarding my =own handle, so I changed it.)\n\nOne thing I did notice is that many commenters on the 2015 puzzle raised issues, but did so mostly politely. There was in interesting discussion on the meaning of INT, the football stat. \n\nBut there was another issue -- many people didn't seem to understand how mirrors work. The very last (most recent) comment just states, as a matter of fact, that \"Mirrors don't reflect at right angles.\"\n\nYes -- yes, they do. They can reflect at any old angle you want them to between 0 and 180˚ (ignoring Snell's law issues arising for the common rear-surfaced mirrors -- or, even better assuming front-surfaced mirrors, for which Snell's law is not in play). \n\nNevertheless, it was refreshing to view the comments for what was apparently a very tricky puzzle, -- where the comments were not riddled with a lot of whining about the puzzle and nasty comments about the editing team and constructors, or claiming all sorts nonsense such as \"B and N and not words\" or the like. Other than not u understanding how mirrors work, that is.","createDate":"1713557033","updateDate":"1713765502","approveDate":"1713557036","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132660967,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bob T.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132663059","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5351269245147705}
