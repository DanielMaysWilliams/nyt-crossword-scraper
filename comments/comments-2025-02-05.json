Nice work and thanks!\n\nBTW, a totally separate rant if I may: on the topic of the Monday vs Friday, Easy vs Difficult thing mentioned in the piece: \n[Ones doing the filming on a set] vs [Focus group?] \n- These aren't necessarily easy & difficult clues, the difference for me is that the first is gettable on its own and the other needs crossing letters to confirm/justify it. Focus group? = camera crew? No, but if you've got CA_E__C_EW you can sigh and put it in. If you had CA_E__K_RS you could sigh and put in \"caretakers\".\n\nI come from the British tradition of cryptic crosswords where every clue should lead to one and only one answer. It's a necessity in grids without so many crossing letters, but at least it doesn't confuse \"vagueness\" with \"difficulty\".\n\nIn a straight definition clue vagueness excusable (e.g. \"Fast\" (5) could be brisk, quick, rapid etc without any crossing letters), but when attempting to be clever/cryptic it's not so fun to have many possible interpretations.

My unit was in the back, and there was a large oak just outside the dining room window, and squirrels would run along the oak, or clamber up the brick walls (or, at times,_in_the brick walls), and perch on the window sill. Very adorable.\n\nNow that spring, in the Manly Month of May, I was doing a driving vacation to visit friends out east--first in Ithaca, NY, then on to Boston, MA. As house-presents, the morning before I was going to leave, I baked two rhubarb pies: a Large pie, and a Very Large pie (40 oz. and 56 oz. of fruit, respectively); and once the were baked, I set them to cool--well, not on the windowsill exactly, but on the radiator in front of the dining room window--while I left to run some errands. When I got home, I found a hole had been chewed through the window screen, and about a third of the Very Large Pie had been eaten.\n\nFrom that moment on, they were no longer adorable, but rather could ROT IN HELL!","createDate":"1738784254","updateDate":"1738824152","approveDate":"1738784256","recommendations":13,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139550806","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8340128660202026}

I’ve been both a NYT and a NYT games subscriber for over a decade. For years, I really didn’t understand what was going on later in the week with the harder clues even when I managed to get partway through a Friday or Saturday puzzle. When I started using my games subscription more regularly a few years ago, I focused on Mondays to get better and finished all the Mondays in the archive. That made it possible for me to get as far as about Wednesday to complete puzzles. \n\nThen in the fall of 2023 I discovered this column and the easy mode clues. Being able to see the easy mode clues side by side with the regular Friday clues set off an aha for me that, within a couple of weeks, allowed me to complete those late week puzzles. I didn’t realize that there could be so much overlap in the answers—I had always thought harder days meant harder on both the clue and answer side, for all answers. Now suddenly I saw where I could gain footholds on any day of the week, esp using all the new terms I’d learned by doing 1500+ Monday puzzles. \n\nThat transformed my solving. I still had to do lots of lookups for a while until I got the hang of parsing the harder clues, but with those I have solved every day since October 1, 2023. And, thanks to this column and community, I am now more consistently able to puzzle out each day on my own, even on most Fridays and Saturdays.","createDate":"1738778308","updateDate":"1738818650","approveDate":"1738778308","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139540097,"parentUserDisplayName":"Heidi","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139547750","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6722171306610107}

I commented that a puzzle isn't work or house chores that you kinda have to keep doing. If it's not fun, it's okay to stop. I did stop that one with 90% of it done correctly because I didn't care.

It's nice to know in a misery loves company sort of way that many folks out here also get it. I do wish I weren't so sensitive though. My husband is much more stoic than I am and less (read, barely at all) prone to anxiety, and I wish I was more like him. He deeply agrees about the malady, just has a more stoic way than I do of dealing with it. \n\nFortunately, he thinks it might not be good if I was also just like him and that he prefers me as I am... cracks and all. Balance is good.  :-)\n\nAnyhow, it's been a whirlwind wreaking ball lately, but remember that hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. Hmm, might be time to rewatch Shawshank Redemption.  And know you aren't alone.

Although I’m not a newbie, this has by far been the most challenging week with my longest solving times.  But I was up for the challenge and completed all 3 days.

I’m about one day past that - I can typically do Fridays, and sometimes Saturdays but do need to do a look up or two. Sundays are often not that hard, just long.
