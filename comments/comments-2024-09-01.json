I like to solve with overlays off, and not looking at the title or any notes until I’m done (or if I get stuck) - as an extra challenge. With this puzzle, I filled in the whole thing except for the shaded squares. I could figure out all the numbers that went with the answers, but not how they went in the squares - until I finally turned on overlays and saw the multiplication symbols. Then it finally became clear 🤓. \n\nHowever, after putting in all the appropriate digits, I got the dreaded notification that I had something wrong.  It took me a loooong time to find it. Instead of “yes mom” I had “yes, not”. ISt worked well for 127 down, and I’d never heard of Ned ROREM, so ROREn seemed reasonable. And having multiple squares wrong is always much more difficult than just one, especially when one is uncertain if something special might be required for the theme squares.\n\nI got it eventually but I was flyspecking for at least 20 minutes.","createDate":"1725160172","updateDate":"1725855011","approveDate":"1725160175","recommendations":5,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135864559","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6538512706756592}

It’s pretty ingenious to have the equivalent of a “cross” but using common factors. E.g. I knew 28 DAYS with absolute certainty, which narrowed the celebration down to a multiple of 4 (because who celebrates a multiple of 7?) — so SWEET 16 became the only real choice. Therefore the remaining numbers had to be a multiple of 4 (eventually solves to PAC 12) and a multiple of 7 (eventually solves to 21 GUN SALUTE). I couldn’t remember the exact number of shots fired, but I knew it wasn’t 7 or 14 or 28 or 35, so 21 was suddenly rounded up from “one of the possible answers” to “the only possible answer.” It’s a fun dynamic!\n\nIt’s the standard clues and crosses that tripped me up for a while. I couldn’t for the life of me remember MARIE CLAIRE, for example, which turned a lot of the NE into a guessing game.
