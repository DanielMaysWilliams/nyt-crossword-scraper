This morning, our local radio station had a short bit on “Stopping By Woods …,” as today (Thursday) is the 101st anniversary of its publication.  It was Frost’s favorite of his poems.  The backstory is poignant.  Frost wrote the poem when he was struggling financially and feared he would not be able to buy Christmas presents for his children.  An unsuccessful farmer, he rode his horse to town to try to sell some produce so he could purchase presents.  He was unable to sell anything and rode back home in the snow.  He stopped beside the neighboring woods and began to sob.  His horse, Eunice, had the grace to let him have a good cry.  Finally, Eunice jingled her bells and they continued their journey home.  \n\nThe story is related here:  <a href=\"https://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php</a>%3Fdate=2012%252F03%252F07.html","createDate":"1709869966","updateDate":"1710374611","approveDate":"1709869968","recommendations":100,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131701072","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7366781830787659}

Putting together a grid with three spanners (with one intersecting the other two) plus two 14s, without ugliness (that is, a spate of junky answers) – as Jackson has done – is puzzle-making acumen no matter what the age.\n\nComing up with memorable clues that have never been used before, that’s a talent that marks a constructor as special.  [Needle on a thread?] for TROLL is just such a clue.\n\nBuilding in bite fairly in a themeless is an art, and this puzzle is not encumbered by the arcane or overly stretchy clues, yet, for me at least, it has areas that made me work, the kind of work my brain finds delicious.\n\nSo, the seeds are here for glimmering grids to come, building on what for me today was a splendid outing.

I don't specifically recall ever using APOLAR, but if I did use it I would expect an intelligent person to understand it.  Anyone with a knowledge of how English works is going to recognize that non-polar and apolar are going to be the same things.\n\nCrosswords are not supposed to be air tight.  They are exercises in fuzzy logic.\n\nAnd apolar compounds are NOT extremely rare.  Many of the simple compounds are apolar.  Methane.  Carbon tetrachloride.   Carbon dioxide.  You mentioned benzene.  But also para-xylene, hydroquinone, trinitro toluene (TNT).\n\nBeyond those from simple symmetry, almost all hydrocarbons are considered to be non-polar because the C-H bond is not very polar, and there is enough symmetry to wipe out any meaningful amount of polarity.","createDate":"1709934523","updateDate":"1709965102","approveDate":"1709934525","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131712349,"parentUserDisplayName":"frankie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131718531","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7717965841293335}
