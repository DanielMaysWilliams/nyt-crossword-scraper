I had filled in the rest of the grid, but I only had SEA OTTER in that SE corner (one of my wife's favorite animals). I pored over it, almost remembering the Nobel author. After a minute or two I broke down and looked up COSTCO. I was able to complete the puzzle then, even though I have no idea what APS and SPORCLE are. The personally naticky crossing at A_S and S_ORCLE I had to resolve by intelligently guessing the letter, and my first choice of P turned out to be correct.\n\nBefore that I struggled in the NW corner, I was happy to remember CAROLE, as she and the tasty CROSTINI opened that area up for me. It took me a while to change ohCMON to AWCMON (how this sort of thing annoys me...), and to remember WALUIGI (I'm a gamer but never played any Nintendo titles), but no lookups were necessary.\n\nIt took me a while to get SITH because its clue misled me. I have always thought Star Wars was fantasy, not science fiction. There is literally nothing scientific about it. It's a sword and sorcery fantasy epic about knights (or battle mages, maybe?) storming castles, which is why I fell for it decades ago.

During 2025 I've worked the 221 2025 puzzles, and 324 puzzles from 2012/13.  Below is the daily percent improvement in time for 2025 vs 2012/13.  I was completed these puzzles during the same timeframe, so this is not a matter of improved skill.  I will allow that there are occasionally answers in the old puzzles are made more difficult because of the gap between the publish date and my completion date, but these aren't common and wouldn't move the numbers much.\n\nMonday: 12%\nTuesday: 17%\nWednesday: 21%\nThursday: 29%\nFriday: 50%\nSaturday: 47%\nSunday: 37%\n\nI believe those who want a more difficult puzzle are likely having a similar experience.  \n\nI enjoy the older puzzles that are more difficult, and would like to see more of them.  Fortunately, I still have many years of the archive to work through.  But, someday, when I run out of archived puzzles I'll lament that there are rarely new puzzles of equivalent difficulty.\n\nMy wanting more difficult puzzles is not a boast.

It was the imperial flag of Ethiopia, and referred to claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. The lion was removed from the flag after the overthrow (and then murder) of Haile Selassie and a subsequent Soviet-backed coup. The current government has replaced the traditional emblem with a golden pentagram on a blue disc, and any display of the Lion of Judah is considered monarchist, and can result in imprisonment.","createDate":"1754754338","updateDate":"1754790631","approveDate":"1754754339","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144157474","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6744975447654724}

I like to tackle puzzles unbiased as to the constructor’s gender, –xual preference, or especially age. I can get a feel through the first 2 passes, and continue on accordingly. Had I seen the photo of this constructor, I might have passed completely. Personally, I'd have chosen a local DMV photo, college ID, security badge, or my pet iguana’s photo. The quasi-bumpkin-ish feel, without really selling it, just doesn't do justice.\n\nI didn't care much for today's puzzle, but I plowed through it. The only two items of real interest to me were yank and sea otter. There were others adequate enough, but hey, it's a puzzle, nothing more.\n\nI didn't realize the Parisians also used the term “yank” for U.S. citizens. I only ever heard  that from the British, and far be it from the French and English to agree on anything. 😁 In a closely related story, Ronnie Van Zant didn't take very kindly to that term when he started touring Europe. He was southern through and through, and made that all too well known. I'll just leave it at that.\n\nAnd those cute sea otters! We've made several trips out to the Monterey Bay Area, walked Cannery Row, visited the aquarium and sat for hours watching the otter diving the kelp beds. They’d come up with a shellfish, lay it on their belly, and crack it open with a rock. Their holding hands during restful periods is adorable to watch.","createDate":"1754757260","updateDate":"1754775208","approveDate":"1754757261","recommendations":4,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144158335","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7189693450927734}

Your solve may have been hindered by one tricky crossing you just didn't know, like the one most people are citing today (AWCMON x WALUIGI).

It always annoys me when I find solvers saying, \"I didn't know X, and I'm glad I didn't.\"  That attitude seems perverse to me.\n\nAnyway, the reason I reference the site xwstats.com all the time is that there you have the only reliable realtime data on the state of the solve.

I very much appreciated the sentiment in your letter. I am unfortunately going through this right now. I’m in Houston now with my oldest brother whose wife, my sister-in-law of nearly 60 years, has finally come home after hospital stays and treatments for the last month and a half.  Being in her own home under hospice care is giving her a great deal of comfort and relative happiness to not be in medical institutions anymore. She just had her first night of unbroken sleep, for one thing. \n\nI went through this a number of years ago with my own wife, so I’m in a position to give my brother some support. It is, of course, re-opening some old wounds. But that’s life. Sad as it is, chances are that one person is going to outlive the other, and you do the best you can to make them happy and comfortable and hope that you’re doing the right thing every single minute.  \n\nI know this has a low likelihood of being seen, since it’s “below the fold”, but I wanted people to know anyway.","createDate":"1754764505","updateDate":"1754789878","approveDate":"1754764506","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144157157,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144159876","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4479869306087494}
