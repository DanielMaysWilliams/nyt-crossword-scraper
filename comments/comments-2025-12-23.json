That would not only preserve the polite discourse, it would send a signal to the relevant poster that they somehow crossed a line.\n\nBut in terms of general moderation: this is, after all, a forum to discuss the day’s crossword. There are plenty of other forums for discussion of politics and other non-crossword-related topics. Many people come here to get away from all that, and their wishes should also be respected. I think we’re given a pretty loose leash in general, but I can’t fault the mods for wanting to rein us in from time to time, when things go too far afield or get contentious. I’ve been on boards where there is no moderation, and it’s not pretty.\n\nPersonally, if I could add one rule (other than to delete individual comments rather than a whole thread), it would be to delete any comments that refer to the crossword constructor as “lazy”.
