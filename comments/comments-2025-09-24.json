Thanks, Peter!\nDid you know that the ancestors of Red Pandas are from the Southern Appalachias? Our Western North Carolina Nature Center has a pair. “History: The red panda’s ancient cousin once lived in the Western North Carolina region. Bristol’s Panda (Pristinailurus bristoli) is an ancient North American relative of the living red panda whose fossils have been discovered at the Gray Archeological Site in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee. Western North Carolina’s climate and ecosystem is almost identical to the lower mountain forests of Central Asia where red pandas currently live. The red panda is an endangered species with less than 10,000 (possibly as few as 2,500) of them in the wild. Their natural space is shrinking as more and more forests are destroyed by logging and the spread of agriculture.”   <a href=\"https://wildwnc.org/animals/red-panda\" target=\"_blank\">https://wildwnc.org/animals/red-panda</a>/\nHope all y’all have a great Wednesday!","createDate":"1758715506","updateDate":"1758762483","approveDate":"1758715507","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145229889","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.918027937412262}

Often you can try to solve the themes without the revealer and then the revealer helps to tie them together later. But I can think of a lot of puzzles where the revealer is referred to early, or you can’t really understand the theme answer until you get to the revealer whether implicitly referred to or not. Think about the wonderful Star Trek puzzle lately. All those down entries really assumed you figured out the theme early to make sense, and I don’t remember anyone complaining. In any case, for my solve, IHOPESO  which made me think about what that theme could be, then got FINGERS and figured out fingers crossed, while also seeing the fingers in the grid—it all happened pretty organically for me and I don’t remember feeling much different about it than most other puzzles.","createDate":"1758732414","updateDate":"1758732415","approveDate":"1758732415","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145227495,"parentUserDisplayName":"B","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145240755","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5667323470115662}

I was complaining about someone, probably a professor, and this guy said, “well, you’ve got to realize, Professor X’s ‘basic problem’ is Y. I don’t remember X or Y. But that comment led to this guy telling me his fundamental philosophy of life:\n\n“Everyone has a Basic Problem. You have one, I have one, she has one, he has one. Everyone. The trick is, (1) accept that; (2) for each person, figure out what that person’s Basic Problem is and decide how you can live with/work with/work around it.”\n\nAfter thinking about it, I realized that his determination about someone’s BP wouldn’t necessarily be the same as the one I would diagnose for that person. Your determination about someone’s BP says as much about you as it does about them.\n\nBut, imo, that doesn’t diminish one bit the usefulness of that guy’s “one-main-thing” in his approach to life.","createDate":"1758746441","updateDate":"1758772225","approveDate":"1758746442","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145227807,"parentUserDisplayName":"sotto voce","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"7952468684046857","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7354586720466614}
