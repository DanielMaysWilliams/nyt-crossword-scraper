(In the constructor notes, if you missed it.)\n\nI finished this puzzle in near record time. Circles in a Sunday grid always slow me down. I just find them more difficult to read—even on my big screen. Is there a reason, or some sort of MORE, that leads a constructor to use circles instead of, say, shaded boxes? I'm probably not the only one who has to strain a bit more to see and read with the circles in it, so I am just wondering. \n\nBetween the circles and having to flyspeck for my incorrect spelling of KEBAB at 73D, which led to TINMaN. TINMaN sounded very feasible for a movie I have no memory of existing. Anyhow, this turned out to be only my second fastest Sunday ever—by a minute and a half. Wasn't really expecting that. I don't care about speed but I do like a bit more struggle and brain engagement to decipher things, especially on the weekend when I have more time. But I did like the MOONSHINE clue a lot. \n\nThere really are a SEA of spellings for meat on a stick, aren't there!? I prefer to think of them as shashlik, because they and pelmeni were staples during my short time in Siberia. \n\nThe only other slight slow down was that I put teak in at 30A. Easily resolved.

A Chief Information Officer (CIO) can be, and almost always is, an exec in *any* large company, not just tech companies, because all large companies have internal information systems, and the person responsible for them is usually a C-level executive called a CIO. This person, for example, would be the person to lead an overhaul of the company’s internal hardware and software systems - including payroll and financial planning software, for example. \n\nOn the other hand, a “CTO” could be a good answer to the clue  “tech company exec” because it’s generally the case that *only* technology companies have Chief Technology Officers. That’s because a CTO’s do not concern themselves with the company’s internal systems, but rather lead the company’s research, development and possibly go-to-market strategy of their proprietary technology. The CTO of a semiconductor company, for example, would typically have a solid background in semiconductor engineering and manufacturing, since that is the “tech” the company is selling. Don’t ask them what payroll system the company uses!\n\nA better clue for CIO would be something like: “top exec in charge of internal systems” \n\nThat’s a long-winded explanation, but hopefully now you all know the difference between a CIO and a CTO. I think the puzzle-makers were a bit confused about that.","createDate":"1770520854","updateDate":"1770621194","approveDate":"1770520855","recommendations":38,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148725416","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7413068413734436}

My longest time was Friday, almost double my normal solving time, though xwstats.com rated it as of Average difficulty. Today's puzzle, rated Very Easy, was close to Friday's time, well over my usual Sunday solve time. \n\nOn the other hand, yesterday's, rated Hard, I solved in a fraction of the time, half my recent and a third my cumulative Saturday averages. \n\nI find that being unfamiliar with a single pop or classical reference can make the difference. However, today I got all those. My sole error was the double one @Dave mentions, having MaN and MeN where it should have been MEN and MAN. I caught these quite late in my flyspecking, when I realized KaBAB was probably KEBAB and OLe could be OLA.\n\nIt would have take even longer had I given in to the temptation to check the spelling of several proper names as I came across them. But I was determined to reconsider every answer at least once before resorting to that.

Wikipedia gives etymology كَبَاب kabāb from Arabic. Since the first vowel is short you can use either a or e to transliterate it. The second vowel in Arabic is a long a, that is: baab — but since that sounds just like the name “Bob” in English it would seem that creative minds came up with “Bob” for that part. Anyway, delicious!","createDate":"1770522807","updateDate":"1770566344","approveDate":"1770522808","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148724764,"parentUserDisplayName":"Anita","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148725582","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8270008563995361}
