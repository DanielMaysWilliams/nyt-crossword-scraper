I aced it. That was because back then the only obligatory subject for everybody was Polish (Lit, to you), and I was great at it. Or rather, I was great at the more important half of it - writing essays. The thing was, the Polish test started with an essay. If you aced it, you did not have to take the other half of the test - an oral examination on 3 millenia of literature (but mostly on the one millenium of Polish lit). I would have hated taking that, because it involved a frackton of rote learning, but I didn't have to.\n\nIt was also obligatory to take a test in one modern foreign language. I picked English and aced it, too (duh).\n\nAnd finally, the third obligatory test was in a subject of your choice. You could pick, among others, math, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, or Latin. However, I did not have to take this test at all. I had taken part in a nation-wide history competition (called the Polish History Olympiad), and I had aced it, thanks to support from my historian father. Not only did that allow me to skip 1/3 of matura, it also gave me access to almost all courses at any Polish university. I picked (probably quite badly) the Law and Administration course at the Facility of Law and Administration of Warsaw University (Law School, to you).
