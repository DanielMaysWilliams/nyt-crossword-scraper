On to \"Unlikely thing off of which to buy haute couture\" -- rather cockeyed phrasing, but it jimmied open a memory I had suppressed in embarrassment: when I was in my twenties, I went to Paris and had a grand time, including a kiss or two (exactly how French were those kisses I can't recall), but one morning I went to the cafe and wanted a coffee to go, not usually offered by this cafe. \"Un cafe americano, pret a porter,\" I said to the barista, thinking the phrase meant ready to go (it means \"off the rack\" which is what popped this back into my brain). \"You want to WEAR your coffee, m'sieur\" said the man mockingly. He made a little show of it, balancing a cup of coffee on his shoulder and doing a small jig. He then, to the laughter of some patrons, poured the cup of coffee into a paper cup and handed it to me with a flourish. \"Here you go, ready to wear!\"  And every time I slunk by the window, he'd still see me and call out, \"Pret a porter, m'sieur!\" Which, now that I'm turning it over in my mind, strikes me as not so terrible a thing, almost charming, and not at all sus.\n\nAny-hoo, I'm giving this puzzle five rama lama ding dongs.

We did it all the time.  It was fun.  It cracked us up.  We still do it.  It knocks us out of our serious adulthood selves.\n\nSo how could I not be charmed by RUBADUB, DINGALING and friends?  And guessing the rhyming word that followed each of the phrases in the grid?  \n\nThe kid inside me also loved learning about the game \"The Floor Is Lava\", which I had never heard of, but what fun!  \n\nIt also loved the schwa A-train of AROMA / ALMA / LAVA / SAGA / SARA / URSA / UMA / PUMA / OTRA, plus RUBA, DINGA, CHOCKA, and CHUGA.\n\nWhat a day brightener!

In Polish it's spelled Nowak (\"nowy/nowa/nowe\" means new, and -ak was a suffix historically used in surname creation. When surnames were becoming a thing centuries ago, a lot of those -ak names arose, e.g. the son of Paul - Paweł - would be called Pawlak). I had no idea it was as common in Czechia as it is in Poland - I needed a few crosses to figure it out.\n\nAlso, yesterday you asked for some Polish oldish movie recommendations. I have a soft spot for \"Faraon\" (The Pharaoh), a 1966 film based on a classic novel by Bolesław Prus, one of our greatest writers. It is a drama about politics, the struggle between secularity and religion, intrigue and love, set in ancient Egypt and actually filmed in Egyptian ruins (which works as the story is set in ca. 1000 BCE, a period of great decline in Egypt after the crisis of 1177 BCE).  This movie is probably pretty accessible to non-Polish viewers because of its universal themes.\n\nOther older Polish films have very Polish themes which a foreign viewer may miss entirely. That being said, \"Seksmisja\", a 1980s satire on communism and dictatorship in general, is my favorite movie of all time. It is so incredibly poignant - but I don't know if an American would appreciate it. Even my very Polish sister-in-law, an inteligent person born in 1990, so after the fall of communism, doesn't really get it. Perhaps it's a \"you had to be there\" kind of thing.","createDate":"1724221736","updateDate":"1724302387","approveDate":"1724221739","recommendations":21,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135602409,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135603359","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7970364689826965}
