On the other hand, M*A*S*H was a gimme, so I caught on to the rebus. I typed Star into each rebus spot, and when I “finished” the puzzle I got the dreaded almost done message.  I couldn’t find my mistake, so I went back and substituted * for Star.  Still wrong.

Of the breeds I knew German shepherds, fox terriers, pekes, dachshunds, schnauzers, great Danes, Podhale shepherd (a Polish breed of large sheepdog, rarely encountered at present...) and - yes! - Afghan hounds, or rather one particular Afghan hound.

There were very few places that had arcade games before 1989 (I recall two in the whole of Warsaw, and one was just a local ice cream bar, which had a single arcade cabinet with River Raid). After 1989, when Poland opened up, it was already the age of gaming at home, on computers. So arcade parlors were not a thing in my life.\n\nI played on an Atari 130XE my parents got me in the mid 80s (at exorbitant cost, as most \"Western\" stuff was then - they made the immense personal financial sacrifice to bring me up in touch with modernity and the West), and then in 1993 I got my first PC. Also, gaming consoles only became popular here ca. 2000, so I'm ignorant of old console games, which pop up in these puzzles so often. I got my own PlayStation as late as 2009. I've never played a single Nintendo game. In fact, I haven't ever seen a Nintendo game with my own eyes, live. The Switch is sold here, obviously, but it does not seem to be popular (maybe because few people had any of the older Nintendo consoles, nostalgia does not fuel sales of the Switch?)","createDate":"1743659400","updateDate":"1743718026","approveDate":"1743659403","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141121443,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141121631","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6590706706047058}
