I was *this* close to turning on auto check, and only some guesses and a lookup or two helped me avoid that.\n\nI found the SW quadrant incredibly tricky and full of unknowns. KINESTHESIA, CRONUT (???), KHAN (this I remembered from some past puzzle in the end), TROTH (???), the strangely clued SENT all being intertwined almost ended up being my undoing. I'd expect such an accumulation of unusual words and proper nouns on Friday or Saturday maybe, not Tuesday!\n\nWhat is TROTH?\n\nHow does \"thrilled\" solve to SENT? I seem to remember something from a previous puzzle or comments to one. Song lyrics? Baby you send me? What weird usage this seems to me...\n\nThere were unknowns for me elsewhere, too. TOLLHOUSE COOKIE I only got from crosses, and not knowing the product I had no idea how it had anything to do with chips. I needed the column to grasp how this was a themed entry. Chocolate chip... Ok.\n\nBTW: in my many years online I was surprised to learn many Americans love chocolate chip cookies but frown upon raisin ones. Apparently discovering what one thought were chocolate chips are in fact raisins is a major first world problem in the US. Raisins are very popular in Poland, and I don't know a single person who doesn't like them. I always have a bag of raisins on hand, and they are one of my favorite snacks. My wife adds them to cakes, too.\n\nThis was not a bad puzzle, but damn was it hard for the day the editor ran it on!","createDate":"1744079979","updateDate":"1744184550","approveDate":"1744079981","recommendations":24,"replyCount":37,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141247380","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-08","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6460633277893066}

Commercial ovens often have this option built in; you just push a button. Many home bakers approximate it by pouring water into an all-metal pan that has preheated in the bottom of the oven, then closing the door so that some of the steam remains.\n\nI have a little homemade contraption for this. It's half a metal can, suspended at the top of the can via holes on either side to a coathanger-wire framework that's wired to the bottom rack of the oven. Beneath that rack is a cast iron skillet that stays there as the oven preheats. Fastened to the top lip of the can is a long brake cable from a bicycle. \n\nI open the oven door after preheating with a measuring cup of water in one hand, pour water into the can, put the bread in the oven on the top rack, close the door, and pull the cable.

It’s like if the clue was “type of window in a room where you sleep” and the answer was “bedroom”.
