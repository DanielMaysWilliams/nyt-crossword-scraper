I loved logic problems then (and still do!). But I felt pulled toward a type I hadn't explored in a long while: crosswords.\n\nAnd on the strength of their wordplay and creativity, I was hooked (sounds fishy but let minnow). Soon, I discovered there were people online who cherished them as much as I did! I found some kindred spirits, humbled by the power of this welcoming puzzling community.\n\nCrosswords - and puzzles more generally - are this beautiful, enigmatic balm, a diversion to cast away your chaos for the time being. They are even a conversation, a conundrum waiting to be cracked. Sometimes, it's a gentle ripple. Other times, the waters are choppy. Always, the experience is exhilarating.\n\nAnd if you know one thing about me, you know I'm a silly goose. Puns and wordplay are goofy - they're how eye roll. But in some ways, they're also therapeutic. Perhaps amid the chuckles and the groans (especially the latter), they give us a little ray of sunshine to scatter the clouds.\n\nEmpathy and kindness still exist, and it's my fervent wish that you find them however you can. On this Thanksgiving, I am deeply grateful for all of you and hope your life is filled with love, joy, and peace.\n\nWith steadfast compassion and an extra helping of puzzles and puns,\n\nMike\n\n(PS: Pass the sweet potatoes.

I was surprised that I had no look-ups on a Thursday (I allow myself a few on Thursday thru Sunday).\n\nI thought I had found the trick: I put SUB in 14D (not entered as a rebus).

I'm so smart! 😁\n\nThen came 34D and 54D. Could not think of a three letter word that fit all the crosses.  Low iron? Bum a cig?\n\nWent to bed without finishing the puzzle.  This morning, I filled in a few empty spots and the other two answers dawned on me!  I entered all 12 rebuses but no Gold Star. 🙎\n\nFinally figured out the wordplay at 65A and got the happy music!

It only ranks #6 in the US and #8 in the world by subscriber count.

The issue is that the historical episode is an extremely painful one for many Indigenous Americans. Many of our Thanksgiving traditions are based on myths that flip the historical truth on its head and rub salt into wounds. \n\nAs a European American, I have finally reached a place where I both give thanks and also take time to be contemplative and to grieve. For instance, even though my ancestors were not in Massachusetts, a little later they were in Georgia and actively participated in the removal of the Cherokee. My relatives still live on land that was stolen at that time. I grew up having vastly more opportunities than friends my own age on reservations. \n\nI understand why some Indigenous commemorate this day as a day of mourning. If reservations were not still experiencing severe systemic issues -- or even if more settler descendants were aware that these issues exist -- it might be different.\n\nDeb's comment allows room for those who have good reasons not to feel celebratory on this day, those who have good reasons to celebrate, and those who have both.","createDate":"1732810159","updateDate":"1732854343","approveDate":"1732810162","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137933766,"parentUserDisplayName":"Teresa","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137939006","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-28","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4901658296585083}
