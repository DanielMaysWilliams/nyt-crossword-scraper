But then I used a technique that works for me in climbing when I'm dealing with a complex route at the gym: I relaxed and opened my mind. And it helped! Slowly (or so it felt) but surely I made progress, actually finishing the solve quickly for a Friday (just a few minutes longer than on a usual Wednesday).\n\nThe unknowns resolved themselves with crosses exclusively (SISEPUEDE, PAESE), educated or lucky guesses (SEN, CORDS) and wild feats of memory supported by crosses (NEYO, SYNE).\n\nAt one point for the long entry in the middle I only had ___EWEWERE. That looked so strange 🤣. Of course I know I'm solving in English but when I encounter something I don't yet understand, I instinctively look at it as if it were in Polish. That's just an impossible sequence of letters in my native tongue (but chrząszcz is a legit word for us 😆).\n\nFor me this was this week's most enjoyable puzzle, by far 👍🏾\n\nI'm also happy because old Jorge the Lab's latest health crisis turned out to be a minor indisposition, and my aging Mustang - which I thought might require major electrical work - just needed a new battery 🤣.","createDate":"1750999045","updateDate":"1751110655","approveDate":"1750999047","recommendations":89,"replyCount":13,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143135849","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8537755608558655}

OK, that one was reaching.\n\nWhether it be a top 12 athlete or a Native American tribe, doesn't UTE tease out one of the greatest legal minds of cinema… Mr. Gambini?\n   Did you say utes?\n   Yeah, two utes.\n   What is a ute?\n   Oh, excuse me Your Honor: two youTHs\n\nThanks for mentioning Big Sur, one of the most breathtaking (not the kind used in Seinfeld) coastal drives on our Pacific coast. The cliffs, beaches, the Bixby Bridge… gorgeous! Brings back great memories. If you feel brave, drive Old Coast Road, which runs behind the Bixby, used by early travelers prior to the bridge. Hope your vehicle has good brakes, but I'd use low gear on the downhill portions.\n\nI tried to squeeze “visiting relatives” into 14A… wouldn't fit. Loved the comparison to odors, though. I joke, of course, we know when to leave my brother’s beach house on LBI.\n\nStanza is always a welcome reminder of early song compositions and I will surely try to fit Hypocorism into my ever dwindling vocabulary.

I love it too and often drink it. The novels about her are humorous and quite gentle, if you’re looking for something soothing in these troubled times. \nI think HAL mostly filled itself in from the crosses but later I looked up the term “hypocorism” which has a fascinating history. “Syzygy” was also new to me.
