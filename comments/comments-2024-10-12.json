Also, ANTARCTIC finally came to me with several crosses already in.

Sadly, however, that thought did not immediately tip me off to the answer to 1A.  The combination 6 grid spanners and a plethora of general knowledge clues that were outside my ken, had me flummoxed for the longest while.  To top it off, boldly putting in bean for chickpea, instead of SEED, made it very hard to see SUCKSWIND.  And as if all that wasn’t enough to induce despair, I had not one but two typos to ferret out at the very end.  This was a great challenge for me, and balanced out yesterday’s easy cruise.  A HAT tip to the constructor for a wild ride with a satisfying ending.\n\nSeeing DESE in the puzzle reminded me of one of my mother’s favorite stories about my childhood.  I was 3 or 4 and we were visiting some family friends who had a boy a couple of years older than me. Apparently (I have no actual memory of the events in question, but know the story only through repetitive tellings) my erstwhile playmate had trouble making the TH sound and was saying dis and dat.  I piped up and said, “Mom, Bruce is a dis, dat, dese and dose boy,” causing my beleaguered mother no end of embarrassment.

He arrived yesterday afternoon and we had a nice dinner together, where he got to meet several of my misfit friends. He also got to meet my remaining pup. My friends and I gave him a lot of recommendations for which trails to check out in Acadia, and a recommendation to swing through the Whites on his return to McGuire AFB. I met him about 30 years ago, when he was a toddler, so he doesn't remember me, and I had no idea what he would look like. It was a good meetup. \n\nHe's an interesting guy -- USAF pilot who flies big planes. He just returned from a 6-month deployment to the Middle East. He is considering moving to Boston to fly for a commercial airline when he leaves the USAF in about a year. \n\nSo, I was offline most of yesterday.

Over the centuries countless people of many cultures and ethinicities were part of the history of the country that these days is modern Poland. Jews, Kossacks, Germans, Italians, and many others - they all contributed to the history and culture of this place. WW2's genocide and the cultural purge of communism resulted in Poland horribly transforming from a multicultural and multhiethnic place into a Polish monoculture, from a colorful place to a gray nightmare. Does this mean we are required to abandon the heritage of all of the people who lived here over a thousand years? It's easy to talk of cultural appropiration when you're not living in a place like this. Is the one apparently appropriate culture for us ethnically Polish? What is that even? This place was the melting pot of cultures from Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Asia, for ten centuries. Calling our efforts to bring this place closer to what it was \"cultural appropriation\" means perpetuating the disgusting legacy of WW2 and communism, of death and destruction. You can't judge us by American standards because this country is nothing like America. And this is me saying this, the most open-minded Polish person you have ever encountered.
