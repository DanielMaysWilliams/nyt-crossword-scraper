For reasons too boring to relate, my brain is a little overwhelmed right now, so getting the theme early on felt like a win. Like Caitlin it was the BLACK EYED PS that pinged the lightbulb. Working out the others was a lot of fun. \nYes, it was as crunchy as I’d expect for a Sunday, but knowing the theme was such a help.\n\nAs always, the many US centric names and products were the sticking point, but the crosses gave me enough for an educated guess most of the time. I stuck with Casey, as in Casey Jones, at 96A for too long. I remembered the tv show from childhood, perhaps it had started on radio?🤷‍♀️ As 72D and 99 D were complete naticks it was a good a guess as any. Ditto 123A. I had ‘lit a fire’; it’s a no-no here, other than in designated fire pits.\n\nThe one clunky sounding clue to my English ears was CIDERY. Is that genuinely what they’re called in the US? Here in Somerset, the home of cider production in the UK, they’re called cider barns, or just fruit farms. I’m lucky enough to live in the middle of a large apple and pear orchard. In the next month (if the storm winds ease off) we’ll be surrounded by blossom.

Sitting in the presence of the royal family was a much coveted honor, and the tabouret was the way to do it. The court tabouret was an elaborate, upholstered stool with curved wooden legs and tassels, carried by a liveried and wigged servant. Duchesses were automatically granted the honor of sitting in front of the queen. This stool became such a symbol of privilege that when Louis XIV's mother, the Regent Anne of Austria, granted the tabouret to two non-duchesses, such a storm of protest was raised that she had to revoke the order.","createDate":"1712513015","updateDate":"1712539741","approveDate":"1712513017","recommendations":5,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132384499","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6833915114402771}

I'm of two minds.  First, I loved the theme and how the double clues worked.  Cracked that early and had a fun time finding those answers.  Filled the puzzle pretty quickly, but with low confidence.  Then, my second impression is that there are WAY too many natick or natick-ish crosses in this puzzle.   If I don't know the name of a particular kind of stool or the name of a particular artist, I have a square I need to run the alphabet for.  One of those isn't really a problem... but if you add in the following proper name crosses you have a problem:\n\nIraqi city / Jewelry brand name\nCurtain fabric / metrology tool name\nGymnast surname / apple variety name\nMusical notation name / Obscure Japanese vegetable\n\nAnd those are just the ones that had me scratching my head.  I'm sure things I took for granted were a challenge for others.  When you have 3, 4 or 5 of these crosses, you end up needing to get lucky or run the alphabet for hundreds of combinations.  Sure, you can infer that 33D is either ALI or ALY, but that multiplies the number of alphabet runs by 2.  18D is probably a consonant, so again, it isn't 26 letters to try, but we're already up to 40+ and we have 3 more trouble spots to include.\n\nIf you don't know either of the words, just just have to run the letters.. there is no puzzling out the name of a city you don't know and a brand name you don't know... you need to just try all the vowels.\n\nNot impressed.","createDate":"1712525011","updateDate":"1713823089","approveDate":"1712525014","recommendations":36,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132387738","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7872303128242493}

Using the list of exclusions is problematic for practicing Kosher Jews.\n\nSome problems regarding the list in Leviticus include:\n\n1. Many species names are inexact; for example, quail.  There are many birds called quails that aren't actually quails, and many that were unknown to the writers of the Torah, so many Kosher Jews avoid eating quail altogether, to be on the safe side.\n\n2. The specific species of many names on the list cannot be determined with certainty, since there aren't reliable records indicating exactly which birds are meant be each name.  Taxonomy wasn't a big thing yet in the Iron Age.\n\n3. A list based on exclusion is problematic because so many birds were unknown by the ancient Israelites.  Is a penguin kosher?  Were parrots even known in Biblical environments?\n\nTo all this, I would add that if you are correct, and there were 5600 parrots aboard the ark, it would seem that it would be a great place to find a pair of them.\n\nAfter all, which month has 28 days?

Even the details.

With 3-4 up-for-grabs squares it's in the 1000's. Even w/some clear vowels, it's impossible. The 9 billion names of God.\n\nI tried SOOO many runs, peeked on google just to confirm stuff— yes, it's riddle me REE (never heard of but had crosses), & yes, UDO's a veg, etc, but then I found it's TABOURET not TABOULET, & thought I might just cede the streak. Put the R in anyway… still no-go! Then peeked at Comments (not the column), if folks were screamimg \"Natick City!' maybe I'd keep the streak. \n\nSaw STAYMAN (I had STAiMAN, I'd tried Y to no avail), & I thot I'd Check Puzzle to forfeit the streak but didn't, way too big a decision for me today ha, & I put in the Y. Feeble 'Yay'.\n\nEarlier amid the flyspecking I'd added slashes to all the rebus squares, then undid 'em…\n\nIt's too bad bc the theme is lovely, & the puzzle is fine except those really are just what you said, possibly-un-parse-able Naticky crosses.

I got 43A correct with STAYMAN on a totally bogus theory. I suspected Apple of being a hidden capital and was primed as a result to think of consumer electronics. Looking at some of the crossings, I figured that if Apple made the Walkman back in the day, perhaps it also made a less portable (and less popular) version it called the Stayman. That worked out, so it was only when reading about the tricky clues that I remembered it was Sony, of course, that produced the former, a once ubiquitous, now largely forgotten, portable music player.","createDate":"1712500776","updateDate":"1712715009","approveDate":"1712500777","recommendations":11,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132378991","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.4472295641899109}
