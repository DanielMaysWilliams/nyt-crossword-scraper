Plus, there's BONDS in this puzzle: Barry Bonds, for instance, holds the record for most walks in major league history (2,558), so if the clue was [Barry Bonds] the answer would be TRIP TO FIRST BASE.  Actually, we hated him in Pittsburgh and were all secretly not sorry to see him to off to the Giants, he was self absorbed, never a team player, including sitting out the last game of the season to preserve his .300 average. He was a real stilt in Pittsburgh compared to how he looked in SF, probably after receiving some SET SHOTS out there. Oof.\n\nAlso, and I got this straight from Dave A. in Rochester MI (aka \"Mr. Shortypants\") as early as 1987, that Neil Armstrong said, \"One small step for a man...\" - and NOT \"one small step for man.\" Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense, man and mankind being basically the same. Dave A. used to go around correcting people whenever they got it wrong, and it became a bit of a problem...(he also measured anything advertised as being a foot long -- hot dogs, subs -- in order to insure he wasn't being victimized). \n\nTurns out Dave A. was right all along:\n\n<a href=\"https://lsc.org/news-and-social/news/did-neil-armstrong-really-say-thats-one-small-step-for-man#:~:text=Or\" target=\"_blank\">https://lsc.org/news-and-social/news/did-neil-armstrong-really-say-thats-one-small-step-for-man#:~:text=Or</a>%20does%20it%3F,not%20discernible%20in%20the%20audio.\n\nAlso, spectacled bears, native to South Africa, are really crazy cute.

For a time, between Midnight Cowboy and the Graduate, it seemed like the formula for cinematic success in that era was to plot a way to get Dustin Hoffman on a bus for the film’s denouement.\n\nAs a birder I was happy to see a STILT clued as an elegant shorebird.
