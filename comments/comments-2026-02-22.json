And I personally cannot escape the imagery of sitting in a catfish’s stomach when I think of Jonah and the Bog Fish.","createDate":"1771725212","updateDate":"1771771473","approveDate":"1771725212","recommendations":3,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149063053","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6544399857521057}

DANGEROUS LIAISONS crossing OPAH, ONEL, COSI, ERDŐS. THE GREAT ESCAPE crossing ED MCMAHON and ERTE. Some wordplay and intentionally vague clueing, especially for all the 3 letter fill along the sides.\n\nDid I find it on the easy side? Totally. I also happened to get the spanners pretty quickly, and knew a good bit of the crossing trivia without a thought (ex: I’ve long been proud to have an Erdős number of 3). But I can easily imagine solvers who would crush Monday - Wednesday still struggling plenty here, especially if they’re on the millennial side and don’t remember some of the theme clues.\n\n(Note: I am a millennial myself, and I only learned about Prince of Tides, Dangerous Liaisons, and Age of Innocence later in life as a cinephile — certainly not as any kind of cultural touchstone.)","createDate":"1771725350","updateDate":"1771844412","approveDate":"1771725351","recommendations":41,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149063073","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-22","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5267884135246277}

Thought it was a clever idea for a theme and I got a kick out of each of the theme answers. I knew most of them almost instantly, but my non-constructor brain probably wouldn't ever have thought them up like our conductors did. I appreciate that lot, and wish I could come up with some more. I might if I gave it some thought but it's so cool how constructors, and many out here, can seemingly so easily come up with fun connections. Respect! \n\nThat said, some twists and turns and misdirects would have added to the fun. I occasionally misdirected myself by thinking I was being misdirected, such as \"Blue material\" solving to DENIM instead of somethin X related. Har! The clue for 86D was fun \"Where boaters hang with bowlers.\" \n\nAlso amusing, but only to this silly rabbit, was that I immediately thought of (but didn't write) pickly for the answer to 12A \n\"Like pickles, but not cucumbers\" Hee!! Thankfully, it didn't put me in a pickle.  \n\nOh, but truly, how I love pickles!  I'm solidly a dill girl and my husband is a sweet man (in every way possible), but there was one pickle we found at a flea market that we miraculously both really liked. For years, we stocked up every time. It was a horseradish pickle made by a local guy. It was a bit sweet on the front with a horseradish kick at the end. It was perfectly balanced for us. We haven't been able to have them since before Covid and can't find anything close.","createDate":"1771725927","updateDate":"1771807848","approveDate":"1771725928","recommendations":21,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149063161","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.953011155128479}

I've been doing the NY Times crossword sporadically for 30 years. Traditionally I would do Monday and Tuesday (sometimes) and spend the rest of the week on the Sunday from the magazine. It would literally take me all week to finish. Sometimes I wouldn't finish. Friday and Saturday I wouldn't bother with because I couldn't even fill in one answer. So a year ago I started doing the whole week and was surprised to see I could now finish a Friday and Saturday with look ups. That was fun. This week I finished Saturday in less than an hour with no look ups. Today, Sunday same. \nThe crosswords have gotten easier. No doubt. Friday and Saturday should be very difficult (if not impossible) for the average person to finish without look ups. It's tradition. I absolutely understand the complaints. If the Monday or Tuesday became so easy that a second grader could do it, we would all be unhappy. \nAnd I'm most alarmed by the people who want everyone on this board to stop complaining  That is the most enjoyable part about reading these comments. I would hate if every comment was just a feel good post. It would be so boring.\nAnd to all the people who do these puzzles and English is your second language, I'm in awe. \nJust my thoughts.","createDate":"1771775186","updateDate":"1771850857","approveDate":"1771775186","recommendations":46,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149070066","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6467333436012268}

They are hoping that editors will finally hear what they have to say. \n\nHaving done the NYT crosswords for decades, something has fundamentally changed over the past few years. There used to be a reliable progression of difficulty through Saturday, and certain gimmicks on certain days. \n\nSunday was special - not necessarily the hardest puzzle of the week, but always challenging and with a clever theme. I would get a cup of coffee, settle in, and anticipate a cozy Sunday morning working on the crossword for an hour or so.\n\nThis is not the case any more. Mondays can be Thursdays, Fridays can be Mondays, etc. There is no anticipation of increasing difficulty, and Sundays can just be \"meh,\" buzzed through in a few minutes (like today). \n\nI do not write this to extol my puzzle-solving skills (which are not great), or demean others. But there is no sense that the NYT Crossword is actually a thing any more. It's just another puzzle to take or leave.  \n\nAnd it's not about the puzzle writers, to whom I am grateful. It's about the editing. There are ways to determine relative difficulty (accounting for potential biases, cultural differences, etc.). There are ways to gauge clues and answers. \n\nThe question is whether the NYT has intentionally shifted to a different type of crossword. If so, please just tell us.

The advantage of a learning curve that long was that it started off fun and continued being fun even after many years of solving. A shorter learning curve can mean fun for awhile, then a ceiling effect where all the tricks and strategies have been learned. That's what happened with me with Wordle. For two years it was fun, then I had the tricks and it was no challenge, so I stopped.  \n\nIt is hurtful when we are grieving the watering down of a long tradition to be told we are humble-bragging and should go elsewhere. Maybe those who feel that way truly don't understand what has been lost. How can you if you never experienced it? When the NYT crossword clues become like all the others out there, there will be nowhere to go. There has been a flavor to the misdirects, a particular kind of cleverness to the clues found no where else, emerging from wonderful interactions between constructors and editors. Cryptics are hard but don't have this flavor. Saturday Stumpers are hard but I don't laugh as I do them.

All in good faith, let's try to converse.\n\nChristian nationalism is a rising political force.  The idea that one cannot be a patriotic American if one is not a Christian.  Many, many prominent church and political leaders teach this.\n\nWriting laws that enshrine purely Christian values--i.e., Ten Commandments in the class room legislation (why not the Golden Rule?  I'd actually support the Great Commandment being in every classroom.)  Five of the ten commandments are actually religious, and have no secular relevance, such as the first rule \"That shalt have no other gods before me...\" and \"keep the Sabbath holy\".\n\nReligion in schools.  The case the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the coach with \"voluntary\" after game prayers on the field.  (Kennedy v. Bremerton School District).  What if you're Islamic or Jewish or atheist, but you really want that starting corner position?\n\nInsistence on a Christian prayer at public meetings and school meetings (primarily in the South).

Maybe a back story to that.\n\nBut, moving on, a primary reason for my decision to not attend church any longer is the political rants coming from the pulpit.

I still believe in my Christian principles, without having to be part of a captive audience every Sunday. Furthermore, any political ideology in this country that incorporates religion as a qualifier, losses my confidence.\n\nTheocratic nations accept only their dogma, and reject the any other. My time in the MIddle East with the morality police watching over we infidels got old reeeealy quick. We do live in a nation founded on Christian principles, but it's been challenged so often, it's become blurred lines.\nSome of the strongholds, like the South, try to hold on to such core beliefs.
