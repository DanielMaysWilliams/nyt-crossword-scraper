VCRs were luxury items, only available in special shops which required purchasing with dollars, and the exchange rate was criminal (you have no idea *how* criminal.

My parents shouldered the cost for my sake: to allow me to watch English-languages films and shows (on bootleg tapes), and improve my English skills beyond what was possible with written matter.

Foreign trade was strictly regulated, and only the government could engage in it.\n\nHowever, \"communist\" governments borrowed money broad, also from capitalist countries, which traded in dollars. The Polish dictator in the 1970s, Edward Gierek, went on a huge spending spree, building new disctricts in Polish cities (including Warsaw's Ursynów, where I grew up), new factories, hotels for state-sponsored vacations, etc. Most of the money he needed, he borrowed abroad. By the early 80s he was out, but the country had to repay all that debt, in dollars. So the government did everything it could to get all the dollars it could get its hands on.\n\nFirst, the exchange rate was not up to the market (there was no market economy, remember) - the government set it. So they made it so it made no sense for people to buy dollars from the government, only to sell them to it.\n\nSecond, the most attractive, luxury goods, like that VCR of ours, were only on sale for dollars in \"skelpy dewizowe\" (foreign currency shops), further incentivizing people to transfer their dollars to the government (all the shops were state owned).\n\nI can't possibly imagine how alien all this must sound to Americans :D\n\nFor some details, Wiki has an article on Pewex and Baltona, the foreign currency shops:\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pewex\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pewex</a> \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltona\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltona</a>","createDate":"1742894633","updateDate":"1742943060","approveDate":"1742894635","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140872742,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140873507","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7602285146713257}

The roasts were shown on network television, and were widely viewed events.
