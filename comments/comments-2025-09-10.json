I was so confused by the clue I had to rely on crosses for the answer.\n\nWe don't really use verbal MNEMONICs over here.

A Thursday from July 10, 2014 by John Guzzetta. Never seen another one like this. Not easy to describe but the theme in this one consisted of some answers with a silent letter in them (e.g. (H)ONEST, LIS(T)EN, I(S)LAND and others. And then in the crossing answer that square with the silent letter was interpreted as being preceded by \"SILENT\". e.g.: \n\nDAM(N)S crossing\n(N)IGHT - so that was interpreted as 'SILENTNIGHT'\nAnd... a couple of other examples; \n\n(M)NEMONIC\ncrossing\n(M)OVIE (silent movie)\n\nELLISI(S)LAND\ncrossing\n(S)PRING (silent spring) \n\nAnd there were more.

The newspaper version is exactly like the printed newspaper, but that often makes it cramped on the page and hard to read. So I usually print the standard layout. \n\nThe newspaper version can use italics for some clues. The standard layout cannot do italics.\n\nItalics are sometimes used in the newspaper version for themer clues, especially if there is no revealer clue.\n\nThe themers are the entries that carry out the gimmick or theme. They are usually the longer entries, and are symmetric about the puzzle.\n\nSome themes are easy enough to figure out without a revealer. Tougher themes use a revealer clue/entry that explains or hints at the theme.\n\nToday, the five rhyming phrases were the themer entries.
