I copped onto the pig latin from the title alone. But the answers? Good grief\n\nI feel like the theme couldn't decide if it wanted to be a straight or meta. The straight answers weren't in pig latin, some of them fit the clue some of them didn't. And the meta answers were hardly in pig latin, some of them fit the clue some of them didn't.\n\nMy (extremely amateur) opinion is that the theme lacked clairvoyance. It's almost impossible to know what to do until you have the correct letter string in front of you, and even then there's a leap in logic. Most people can't do a crossy downs only, how would one ever arrive at that string? to then even start solving the puzzle?\n\nI get that this setter likes really tough puzzles, and I'm definitely a Monday/Tuseday sort of person. But a good, hard, puzzle, leaves you feeling good even when you reveal it.

I guess I've learned something new. I wonder if it's possibly a regional thing as well.\n\nCorset supports are \"bones\" or \"boning\", as they were once made from whalebone (baleen), but a pair of STAYS is a separate garment that actually predates the corset. From the late 1400s right through the Regency (Jane Austen) period, women wore undergarments called \"stays\" meant to provide bust and back support, disperse the heavy weight of many layers of petticoats and farthingales, and smooth the torso into a conical shape to best display expensive dress fabrics and embroidered stomachers. They were stiffened with dried reeds, cording, and wooden busks, and there was no way to really compress the waist, as is famously associated with the corset, so most women actually liked wearing them (most women liked corsets in the 1800s, too, as tight-lacing was something of an upperclass fad and not a common practice).\n\nI can see where some might call a corset \"stays\" (and quite a lot vice versa), but as the third generation historical costumer in my family, I can say from experience that if you were to try and find corset-making supplies online, \"stays\" will take you to options for that older style I mentioned, like wooden busks or rolls of Oval Reeds and Round Reeds. If you want the flat steel or spring steel that has replaced whalebone, that is \"boning\".","createDate":"1755454448","updateDate":"1755518638","approveDate":"1755454448","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144332990,"parentUserDisplayName":"Isabeau","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144340000","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8011559844017029}

I‚Äôve always just thought they were probably also enjoying the lake, and heard we were there. Many people who lived on the lake brought their boats and jet skis, and made sure we all had an amazing day. \n\nAnyway, as word spread that REM was at the picnic area, we, children with cancer, asked for autographs. Not anticipating we would be meeting celebrities, we didn‚Äôt bring our autograph books üôÑ.
