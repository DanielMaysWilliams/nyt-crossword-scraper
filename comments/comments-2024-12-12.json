Nonetheless (and despite the fact that I couldn't crack the NW corner immediately, so I did it like a Saturday, starting wherever I could and then just moving around from there) I was able to complete the puzzle in about 14% below my average Thursday time.\n\nRecently, I have been making mention of the site xwstats.com, where, if you sync your account to it, you can get all kinds of information about your solve and the experience of all participating solvers.  (This grouping probably includes more serious solvers than any random group of solvers, so the numbers are probably better overall, but the trends should still be clear.)\n\nXwstats found the difficulty level to be \"Very easy\", with the median solver 36% faster than their usual Thursday.  80% of solvers solved \"much (>20%) faster\" than usual.

And how many of those people repeated the same discredited complaint that LIRE in the plural ruined the clue.  It's as if no one ever reads the prior comments before plonking down their own.  As if it were a novel complaint that hadn't already been answered.\n\nPretty much everyone who complained missed the point.  Yes, you do say \"The currency of Italy before the euro was the LIRA\" (singular).  But \"currency\" can be used in more ways than one.  Not just to name the unit (in the singular), but also to refer to any amount of cash.  \n\n\"There's a pile of Italian currency on the table.  I count a million LIRE.\"  Those LIRE are old Italian currency.  End of case.\n\nLIRE has been in the (main) puzzle many times; 23 of those times, \"currency\" has been in the clue.\n\nApparently, the editors (and it goes back to Farrar in 1951) are fine about cluing LIRE in the plural with the word \"currency\".  And they are not wrong.  At the same time, the singular LIRA has also been clued using the word \"currency\" 37 times.

Later, after it was accepted, I was told that many of the test solvers struggled to understand the gimmick. The editing team suggested shading the smaller theme entries. I pushed back a bit and suggested highlighting the numbers only, hoping to preserve some of the challenge I felt a Thursday puzzle should bring.\n\nWhat do you think?
