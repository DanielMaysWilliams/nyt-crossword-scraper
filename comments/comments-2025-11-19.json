(And yes, if it's in the dictionary, it's a word.  And if it's a word, it's good to be in the puzzle.  That's how it goes.)\n\nAnyway, today's obvious clunker to anyone who follows the sport is MINOR TEAM.  Certainly, these two words together as a pairing exists, at least sporadically, since if you do a search, you'll find examples on the internet, although none of the ones I saw were by professionals.  And this is because it's not what teams like the Syracuse Mets are called.  They're called \"minor-league teams.\"  This distinction is important; one is the normal term, and one is the term a few people who don't know the normal terminology have occasionally used.  (I base my opinion on the fact that I watch or listen to at least 150 games a year, and no one well-versed in the proper lingo says it...I've literally never heard it on a baseball broadcast.)\n\nDoes it work in a crossword?

That was before everything went digital. I learned then it was important to use lower case letters when solving, since they're faster to write and the puzzles there are all timed. I no longer solve for speed but still print the puzzle, and still use lower case letters. So even though I flew through this puzzle, it took me a little extra time to understand the theme, which happened right after I got the first revealer. Definitely a lightweight theme, IMO, Ozempic notwithstanding.\n\nThe letters Z and N only work with this theme if you type them or use upper case letters to fill in the grid on paper.","createDate":"1763555798","updateDate":"1763606759","approveDate":"1763555799","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146746392","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.677920937538147}

Taken separately I would certainly ignore any of the them, taken together they definitely give me pause. I’m usually the first one to give extra points for cleverness and level of difficulty, and as Lewis mentioned this is a very complex theme to put together and was done well within the constraints. But I found it somehow dissatisfying. both easy and hard at the same time since the theme gave away a lot of the solve which would have been arcane to me otherwise.

Three complete CCW (positive in mathematics) rotations happening in the course of one CCW rotation around the grid.\n\nIndex +3, perfectly portrayed!\n\nWill need to save this one for the next time I teach a course that discusses indices of vector fields.\n\nBrilliant!\n\n(Solved it in about 11 minutes, without realizing at all just how beautiful it was.

I type these words as a small ode to him.\n\nMy mom gave me an LP of his version of Dvorak's New World symphony, with the San Francisco orchestra, when i was a teenager. I would sometimes lay on the couch and just listen, like you would in a concert hall, but getting up partway to turn the record over and then slip back into the musicdreamspace. Often when i played an album i would prop the jacket up in front of the turntable, like in a record shop, as the now playing selection. Over the years, i must have spent several hours gazing at the cover photo of Mr Ozawa looking past the Golden Gate Bridge like an explorer, a man finding a new world. I only know him from that photo and the music he guided other musicians to make. \n\nThank you, Jeremy Newton, for inspiring me to dig out that record and play it again.","createDate":"1763582066","updateDate":"1763611248","approveDate":"1763582068","recommendations":22,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146759736","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6818045377731323}

Most pro American sports, particularly football (our version) and basketball, draw from college teams, and sign these players after their collegiate careers (and in some cases, before they finish college).  College sports are quite popular, but are nowhere near the level of pro sports.  In fact, many college football stars spend their first year in the NFL just practicing and learning.\n\nBaseball is different.  Because baseball is primarily played when colleges are on summer vacation, the pool of talent comes from various sources, with a much higher ratio of international players vs. American ones.  (College baseball does have a short season in the spring, but it's not nearly as popular as football and basketball.)\n\nAs a result, an elaborate system of minor leagues exist in baseball with varying designations, from collegiate summer leagues (for college students, but not run by the colleges), through several other low-level designations, to the A-level designations, in rising order, A, AA and AAA.  These latter teams all have affiliations with major league teams, and as such are considered a \"farm system/teams.\"  They play in medium-sized cities like Buffalo and Charlotte that often have major league teams in other sports.  These teams are called \"MINOR league TEAMS,\" not \"MINOR TEAMS.\"\n\nMinor league games can be fun to attend, as they cost less and you generally can get better seats, and for some, are closer to home.","createDate":"1763557736","updateDate":"1763576202","approveDate":"1763557737","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146743415,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sally","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146746803","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.844448447227478}

The books are set Ohio—my home turf, albeit the most southern part—in the first half of the 19th c. In them, Richter tries to capture the vocabulary and speech patterns of the frontiersmen and -women, which can be a little off-putting at first: “butts” are tree(trunks), the “bound boy” is an indentured servant. I particularly liked the (distant) Great Lakes referred to as the “English Seas”— remember, this was about the time of the war of 1812— although I can’t find any usage of the phrase outside of Richter.\n\nAnd, remember, never show up at someone’s cabin without a haunch of freshly shot game!\n\nIn the1970s, The Awakening Land was made into a made-for-TV miniseries (remember those?), starring Elizabeth Montgomery and Hal Holbrook as Sayward and Portius. I found it almost unwatchable, as I couldn’t not picture Samantha the Witch marrying Mark Twain.

I'm happy for your success. But not everyone can lose in a steady linear fashion like that.

At first, I lost easily using Weight Watchers. But after my second child, my loss was erratic, and after a certain point, it didn't matter WHAT I did, I continued to gain. \n\nI started a medically supervised weight loss program in 2016, working with a doctor and a dietician. I lost slowly but steadily for a year, then hit a wall. I started using Saxenda, precursor to Wegovy.
