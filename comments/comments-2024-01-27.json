By fresh I mean answers we have never seen in the Times or have hardly ever seen, meaning that we are not only brushing against newness in answer, but in clue as well.  It’s like going someplace you’ve never been before – your interest is immediately magnified.\n\nThere are ten NYT debut answers here, nine of them bigs (eight letters or more).  But it goes beyond that.  They are bunched at the heart of the grid, the center stacks.  Not just the gorgeous triple horizontal middle stack, but also the stack that begins with RAIL THIN and heads southwest to GLORIOUSLY, and the one starting at BOSS BATTLE, cascading down to CONFIDANT.  Every single answer in these three big stacks are either debuts or have appeared only once before in the NYT puzzle!\n\nOMG, that is remarkable!  That is the opposite of stale.  And this group is not ho-hum – my favorite debuts including CULT CLASSIC, HOT SOAKS, JAUNDICE, RUSH JOBS, and TOOK LEAVE.  And the one-timers include CONFIDANT, BOSS BATTLE, and NONE TO SOON.\n\nSo, a highly entertaining solve for me, this grid pulsing with originality.  Layer on top of that that this is a debut puzzle (on a Saturday!), made by a father who clued the puzzle, and daughter, a sophomore in high school who designed and filled the grid – and I’m feeling very good about the world and Crosslandia.\n\nThank you, G&G, for knocking my socks off in addition to a most splendid solve.

The last is only possible with a hole-in-one on a par 5, or by taking only two shots on a par 6 hole (which is itself a rare bird).

In the lyrics Mr. Henderson was to perform somersaults over men and horses and “lastly through a hogshead of real fire”.  The next line’s mention of “Henry the Horse”  got the song banned from radio broadcast by the BBC as it supposedly was a slang term for heroin.

So it takes some review of the completed grid to remind myself that today's exercise was not a smooth flow from beginning to end, despite many areas where I was cruising along! It felt like learning to drive stick shift: that sudden studder from a previously purring engine, sometimes recovered in time to keep moving forward, sometimes stalling out with a loud clunk. (It just  occurred to me that our high schooler constructor may be more acutely involved with my metaphor than I, many decades past that debacle!)\n\nSo much great wordplay!! Far and away my favorite is \"Way down below\" - helped in part by the H in SHADE, one of the first answers I got and definitely one of those \"no way this is right\" moments. Also enjoyed the echoed 7D and 39D. \n\nAfter reading the Constructor Notes, I have to say it's too bad 31A couldn't have been stretched 2 more characters to NONE MORE BLACK.\n\nI'm not even remotely a Rush fan, but I too think the clue for 23A was a missed opportunity. Especially on a Saturday! C'mon, if we have BINET, we certainly could've grokked a rock band! The published clue was clunky, to say the least: a quick turnaround does not denote \"on the fly\".
