For a while I thought I might end up with a personal best but ran into a couple snags and finished a few minutes over my best time. \nPuzzles that rely on puns for their themes always make me think of my father, who passed away 41 years ago at 60. Often, if he was home for dinner (uncommon as he was a doctor who was a workaholic—hence his four coronaries) he expected me to engage in a pun-duel, in which he’d make a pun and I had to respond with a pun related to his, then he would have to build on that, then I would, continuing until one of us (usually me) would surrender. Mind you, this started when I was perhaps 13 or 14. Later, some years after his death, I came to understand that he was quite shy, even to the point of having no idea how to talk to the son who bore his name, and so puns were his way in.","createDate":"1763301240","updateDate":"1763372915","approveDate":"1763301241","recommendations":37,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146681957","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9143679141998291}

It was doing fine for bilions of years. Once we settled down it only took us some 10 millenia to ruin the Earth so much it might soon not be able to support our own survival. We eradicated countless species, and kiIIed countless millions of our fellow humans on the way, with malice and cruelty unmatched by anything in the natural world, for power, profit and in the name of ideology. No amount of good will ever erase that.","createDate":"1763282425","updateDate":"1763378564","approveDate":"1763282427","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146679432,"parentUserDisplayName":"Melissa Cusack Striepe and Ian Currie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146679482","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-16","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8752569556236267}

It was dirty, grey, dangerously polluted, riddled with both petty and violent crime, and getting worse every year, up until the end of the decade. When I returned to Warsaw from my month in London as a 13 year old in 1993 I literally cried for a week, despairing over how horrible my home country and city were. It's only now, over 30 years later, that I am finally beginning to enjoy living here. Experiencing Poland in the 1990s was one of the main reasons I never really became a Polish patriot.

Like you said, people know themselves. Acting upon what one strongly feels is the right choice for them surely can't be sad?\n\nDespite having experienced a nurturing childhood, I have always felt zero inclination to be a parent. While many people instinctively love babies and find them cute, I'm borderline disgusted by them. Elementary school kids tire me out, and teenagers are monsters best avoided. The people I meet at uni when they're 18 or 19 are generally quite cool. But getting there... Nah.\n\nAlso, the largely carefree life I lead is 100% incompatible with having children - I would have to change literally everything about it. I might end up miserable, like those 15% or so of people who regret having kids. The risk is just too high. But that's me, and apparently Bill in Yokohama too. I'm not saying we are better or worse than people who want to have kids. We are just different. I'm not feeling sad about my choice, at all.\n\nAnd I'm not a psychopath. I understand what feelings parents have for their children - being my father is obviously the most important thing in my dad's life, and I love being his son. But even so, I just don't see myself in that parental role.\n\nAnd finally, I really do believe humanity is heading for distaster - within decades, not centuries.

At those times learn as much as you can about what you missed in terms of clue trickery, or theme  hints, and the like.  \n\nAnd if you're like me vent a little in the comments, within the limits of respect for the people who produce the puzzle.
