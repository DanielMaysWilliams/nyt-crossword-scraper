All us Slavs were lumped together, even though we are diverse people with strong national identities, varied histories and different languages. Historically, those who treated us as a homogenous group did it not out of the goodness of their hearts but to murder us and turn us into slaves.\n\nSome of us know your \"Sacha\" as Sasza, sure, but to some us it is Sasho (Bulgarian) and Sasze (Macedonian).

Also, HAM IT UP!  \n\nAnd, I am extremely proud of how easily I plopped in the geography entries. Well, Sarasota took me a while, but MOZAMBIQUE, BUENOS, and PERU all came very quickly, again thanks to the geography game I play. Those were big helps\n\nIt made me smile big to plop in SAsHA immediately on the first go round. I eventually had to switch the s to C, but I have extremely fond memories of a particular man named Alexander/Sasha. I thought he spelled it with sh but it was very long time ago so I may be misremembering. I also have read the comments and see that there is some explanations of this. I also think that he might have spelled his name Aleksandar... Hmm. \n\nEither way, it is a joy to think of him and his family, who I loved so dearly, and the many, good laughs and stories we shared in various kitchens and living rooms and picnic tables. ❤️ \n\nIt's funny how puzzles can elicit such deep memories.","createDate":"1726948238","updateDate":"1726993147","approveDate":"1726948241","recommendations":13,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136362310","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9497734308242798}

The name is not geographically incorrect at all, and I presume the same is true in French. Of course, Caribbean's misidentification as India by Europeans is behind the name West Indies, so there was a mistake involved along the way (in a way).\n\nOh, and in Polish \"Guinea pig\" is called \"świnka morska\", literally the \"piglet of the sea\", and the name makes perfect sense, strangely enough.\n\nWhy a piglet? Because the squeaking of a Guinea pig is much like that of a piglet. Why \"of the sea\"? Because it arrived from overseas. \n\nThe English etymology, as I just checked, is similar, at least partially. Guinea probably is a placeholder for a faraway, mysterious, overseas country, so it is an analogue of the Polish designation, in a way.","createDate":"1726928930","updateDate":"1726953005","approveDate":"1726928933","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136350027,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136354695","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8761963844299316}

Oxidation is the loss of electrons, which then travel through the circuit to the cathode, where the combine with something which accepts elections.\n\nSo with electrons flowing from the anode to the cathode, those electrons are released from the anode.  The electrons \"pile up\" at the cathode.  Then the cathode releases those electrons to a chemical substance with absorbs them.\n\nA very common electrochemical equation is \n\n     Zn(s) + Cu++(aqueous) --->  Zn++(aqueous) + Cu(s)\n\n   Anode reaction:    Zn(s) --> Zn++(aq) + 2e-\n   Cathode reaction:   Cu++(aq) + 2e- ---> Cu(s)\n\nSo, the entire process is the Anode material, like Zn, release electrons to the circuitry, the electrons travel to the cathode, where they are released to the cathode material, like Cu++(aq)\n\nI doubt this will convince anyone.
