This puzzle was just Hard, so newcomers, do not despair.  Most Mondays are easier.\n\nOf course, being tired, the puzzle was a little tougher for me than it should have been.  And I thought that the two-part clue at 56A/58D was as close to a Monday Natick as they come, given that both clues refer to the same film, which I'd never heard of.  On the other hand, an alphabet run reveals that the crossing R is the most likely letter to go there.  But nevertheless, it was still a guess and not a sure bet.\n\nRegarding a comment I made in yesterday's section about the rock song that the puzzle featured:  I guess I should have fine-tuned my objection by saying that only serious fans of mid-60s hard rock would know that song.  I don't care if 15 of you tell me it's a classic song, and 50 of you recommend those people.  If you're a serious fan of that genre, you know it.  But there were lots of others--even in your age group--that didn't care for that flavor of rock.  And they'd know Riders on the Storm, Love Her Madly, Light My Fire...but not that one.\n\nSo maybe you're right that it's a so-called \"classic song\", but I still think it's a bit esoteric to build a Sunday puzzletheme around.","createDate":"1752453224","updateDate":"1752503891","approveDate":"1752453225","recommendations":5,"replyCount":14,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143508797","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5428265333175659}

In my daily life, I see enough of people who have no idea what they're talking about yet believe what THEY know (or believe they know) is the ONLY way something can be. They spell a word one way? The heck with any alternative spellings! Those cannot possibly be right! \n\nAnd now we have a jackmule over there claiming that jacks and jennies are mules, not the answer in the grid. \n\nI run into this kind of nonsense too much these days. It is sad that so many people believe that if THEY don't know it, it must be wrong. \n\nI think a lot of these people are offended if their first idea of what an entry might be is contradicted by the crosses. Checking a square through a cross is sort of the point of a CROSSword! I jst change the square and move on. Som times I laugh! I never get angry at the constructor. When the new word is new to me, I don't say \"That's wrong because **I** didn't know it! (or enter it at first).\" I actually enjoy being fooled once in a while.\n\nLook at all the comments today praising the puzzle and explicitly or implicitly comparing it to yesterday's. \n\nOf course the clueing is easier on a Monday! It's a Monday! That doesn't mean it's necessarily better.
