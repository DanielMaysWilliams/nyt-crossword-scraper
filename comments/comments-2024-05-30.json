We all know that rebus puzzles almost always appear on Thursdays or Sundays, even though when you go over to xwordinfo you can see they have appeared on other days as well. In particular, if you look at Monday rebus puzzles they seem to involve just one or a couple of squares, often just using an Arabic numeral as an entry. Wednesday rebus puzzles are a little more varied. One that caught my eye was 3/4/2009 by C.W. Stuart, obviously with Will as editor.  This puzzle had eight identical rebus squares placed symmetrically around the sides of the grid each reading IN/OUT. The revealer was smack in the middle of the grid, “Choice for a dog, as well as a hint to this puzzles theme.” Answer: INOROUT. A perfect, easy rebus puzzle to run on a Wednesday. I think Joel lost out on a great chance to run today’s puzzle yesterday, I think it would have received rave reviews.","createDate":"1717103297","updateDate":"1717122067","approveDate":"1717103300","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133564815","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.784416913986206}

But wow! What a lot of J's in this puzzle!! And a few Z entries, too -- without checking, it seems a great case for a pangram.\n\nBut wow! Those J's!! My understanding (from the Wordplay community, of course) is that J is the most (or one of the most) difficult letters to include in a puzzle. This puzzle has a stellar number of them, and they're not even related to the theme or theme answers! \n\n4 squares/8 words beginning with J. Very nice. Juicy, even!\n\n(Now that I've written all that, I realize I didn't scroll far enough back to read Lewis' post.
