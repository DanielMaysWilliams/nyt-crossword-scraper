Makes for very interesting and some often-heated discussion, as it's believed to be pure conjecture. It's best to read up on it, since much of it is based on opinion.

What sort of sorcery is this!? \n\nReminds me of earlier today. Got to go in the sea today and ran into some folks my husband knew long ago. It was lovely. We talked a bit about how it's nice to be here this time of year because of all the fruit coming in. The man asked if I like mango. I told him it's my favorite. He asked me if I'd ever eaten it in the sea. The sea!? Why, no... who has ever heard of eating mango in the sea!? Then, as if some magical mango man, he conjured up a mango out of the ETHER, or perhaps his pocket, and handed it to me. It was like a miracle on ice, only not. My husband laughed and told me they always used to eat mangoes in the sea. So today, for the first time, I ate a mango in the sea.  What a world! It was extra delicious and a wee bit salty! Okay, ILLSTOP!\n\nI enjoyed the puzzle!!  No OBJECTions. I started with  STILLONTHEfence but the kindly crosses quickly disabused me of the fence and led me to the table. The rest came smoothly!  I guess there were a lot of names, but today they were in my wheelhouse. Even AARON, which surprised me. I put it in right away but was prepared to remove it.\n\nTAGSALE filled itself in but I hadn't heard of it before. I assume it's the same as what I'd call a rummage, yard, or garage sale. \n\nAnyhow, my mother-in-law is having a bad night hallucination wise, it's going to be a long one for us.
