He has a showdog named Dean from Malta -- but not a Maltese -- that he took to the Westminster show, but Dean proved to be erratic, whirling when he should have swirled, ignoring all of Leo's oral commands, including \"Psst!\" which had always worked in the past, and he finally got loose, having stretched his leash so taut it broke, and peeled off to a cheese store to roll around in feta, then dashed back out again, straight back to the dog show and stood in front of Leo wagging his tail and shaking off the feta, which flew off him in arcs reminiscent of some Tim Duncan jumpers. This incited a riot among the senoras' chihuahuas, and it got pretty hormonal (if they were human you'd have seen some sexts, or is that TMI?) One judge opined that the dog stank and refused to select him for the final round. \"That dog don't hunt,\" he said. It took a visit to a Tea Tree outlet to get their special oil shampoo before Dean was entirely clean. Dean stared up at Leo as if asking, \"What now?\" \n\n\"Those dog people are all bores to panic over something like that. We're getting no respect at all here.

The only exception being Thursdays, which have a greater increase over Wednesday, likely because we sometimes we struggle with the Thursday trick that week (still fun, though!).\n\nSo we decided to do some basic analysis of the increase in solve times between each day. For the ~3200 puzzles we've done (love the archives!) and taking out (or \"normalizing\") Thursday, the percentage increase in average solve time is remarkably consistent  about 28% (a bit larger percentage increase from Tu to Wed). \n\nEven the increase in average solve time from Saturday (hardest) to Sunday (bigger grid, but less difficult) is nearly identical to the other days of the week, Thursday excepted.   \n\nThis indicates, over time, how really well the editors and constructors consistently adjust the difficulty level for each day of the week. Pretty amazing.\n\nHere are our numbers, showing the percent increase in average solve time between consecutive days. it would be interesting to see if others' Stats page show similar consistency.\n\nM-Tu: 27.3%\nTu-W: 32.6%\nF-Sat: 26.7%\nSat-Sun: 28.2%\n\nAnd if you look at the Wed-Fri difference in our average solve times (thereby ignoring the inevitable tricky Thursday anomalies) and divide the increased average solve time by 2 days, the percentage increase is exactly 28.0%.","createDate":"1704724309","updateDate":"1704916198","approveDate":"1704724312","recommendations":11,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130310740","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6042696237564087}

The calf roping was unforgettable for the one cowboy who had a particularly energetic and uncooperative calf; every time he got hold of the three legs and reached for his piggin string, the calf kicked free and even got back up.  The clock kept ticking.  Finally the cowboy succeeded in the task of tying and threw his hands up to stop the clock, but of course his time was terrible.....so he peevishly gave the calf a little kick.  \nI reckon the lesson there was:  no matter how badly you've embarrassed yourself, you can always find a way to make it worse.....so don't.  \n\nOh, the puzzle.  Obviously, it took me back.  Arkansas is really more Western than Southern in some ways.
