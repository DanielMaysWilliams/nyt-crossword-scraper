Until then, synthesizers were huge, expensive items, which relied upon vacuum tubes and punch cards for input, and affordable by electronic music studios of only the most well-heeled academic institutions. With the release of his first synthesizer in 1964, Moog created an insrument of manageable size, and dropped the price to one-tenth. Also, I believe it was the first synthesizer with a piano-style keyboard interface. But the real breakthrough came in 1970, with the release of the Minimoog, which was portable, and cost a mere $1600--expensive in 1970, but not prohibitively so.\n\nI see that Moog, who began his career building theremins and was interviewed in the 1994 documentary *Theremin: an Electronic Odyssey*, is the subject of his own 2004 documentary. It's posted, in its entirety, on Youtube; I shall have to watch it tonight.\n \nMinimoogs, Yamaha DS-7s: models of those early synthesizers from the 70's and 80's, still in playable condition, have become widely sought after by collectors and performers in tribute bands--Historically Informed Performance practice, HIP-HIP-hooray!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZWB0VF2vDI\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZWB0VF2vDI</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw3My7_neA4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw3My7_neA4</a>","createDate":"1706022615","updateDate":"1706075029","approveDate":"1706022618","recommendations":13,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130643671","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6879907846450806}

I haven't read it in years, and when I did I enjoyed it for its great economical prose and simple approach, although I didn't really pay much attention to it as a guide to how to write better. Recently I got a copy of it illustrated by the great Maira Kalman and thumbed through the pictures, which are so very Kalman.

Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand!”\n\nHere are some other pieces of good advice from it:\n\n“A single overstatement, wherever or however it occurs, diminishes the whole, and a carefree superlative has the power to destroy, for the reader, the object of the writer's enthusiasm.”\n\n“Writers will often find themselves steering by stars that are disturbingly in motion.”\n\n“To achieve style, begin by affecting none.”\n(That's one of the more well known aphorisms contributed by EB White -- who was also the author of Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web, among other masterpieces.)\n\n“A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.” (That's a Strunkism.)","createDate":"1705988395","updateDate":"1706078620","approveDate":"1705988397","recommendations":38,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130637045","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.45548856258392334}
