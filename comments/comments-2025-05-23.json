I see that others have flagged the difficult/questionable parts.\n\nIt started merely mildly frightening for me, but then I found myself breezing through much of it.  And then I went back to the upper left... and stayed there forever.  After many attempts I figured my streak was finally broken.  I rolled the alphabet one last time - so it was ADU and not Additional Rental Unit.  Never heard of it.\n\nThe real problem was a minor poet from 50 years ago.  I see the resident supercilious snoboscenti have already made sure to try to make those of us who don't know him/her feel small.\n\nI was pretty sure on most of the down answers, but the somewhat ludicrous spelling of the poet's name held me back for quite a while.  It's from half a century ago, I thought, surely the constructor wouldn't find someone with unusual first AND last names, right?  Wrong.  Must be Lorre, right.  Wrong.  Audra certainly, maybe Audry?  Nope and nope.  This person's name with ADU was my personal Natick.\n\nIt didn't help that I kept toggling to Manet/Mantero just in case, though I was pretty confident on Monet.  Another vaguely Naticky square for me.\n\nIt also took me a while to change from Waist to Wrist.  I see many others did the same.  Personally I enjoyed Wrist as an answer.  Verbing is so common that I found nothing wrong with the entertaining clue.\n\nThe gap in knowledge is my own failing and this puzzle was still well done.

Actually, I'm sure I have not. How can I be sure? Well, I was in my late 20s when I met my future wife. I come from Warsaw in Mazowsze (Mazovia), and she hails from another part of the country. Only after months of listening to one another did we realize there are minor differences in our Polish. Among them was how differently we pronounce the letter \"e\" after a consonant, especially after \"g\", as in the name Genia (diminutive of Genowefa, Genevieve). When I say it, it sounds as it were spelled Gienia [hard G as in gun; followed by \"yeah\" and \"nyah\": G-yeah-nya]. When my wife says it, it sounds as it is literally spelled, without that additional soft \"i\" after the G. So my wife's Genia sounds like [G-Enya: that's the hard G again, and the artist Enya].\n\nSo, apparently, were I to spell out the G sound, it would be \"gie\" (in Polish, so probably gyeah in English), but for my wife it would be \"ge\".","createDate":"1747992848","updateDate":"1748021674","approveDate":"1747992849","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142334425,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142335518","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.49591198563575745}
