Grid \"art\" -- not so much.  But Daniel has made a good stab at it.  If I squint really hard, I can almost see a ROCKETMAN.  Or is it the ROCKET itself I'm seeing?\n\nNo matter.  I never care about grid art anyway.  This is such an enjoyable puzzle with or without it.  Even the most mundane words were clued in an interesting way.  One example.  I pondered: Is \"fourscore\" one word or two?  If it's one, then the answer to 19A is AGO.  If it's two, then the answer is OUR.  I decided it was one.\n\nIn such ways does a good left-brained constructor come up with clues that are little puzzles in themselves.
