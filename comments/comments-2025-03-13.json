The name itself has interesting Japanese origins about hunting octopodes, but that is besides the point. For those who have not heard about it, it is when a spouse dies and the surviving spouse, seemingly in good health previously, dies shortly thereafter.\n\nI posted in December when my grandmother passed away. My grandfather lives in a care home with dementia, but otherwise seemed to be doing well. My aunts finally cleaned out their condo last week and moved/sold everything. They told grandpa that it was done a few days ago. 2 days later, he developed liver failure. I just came back from the hospital; he has metastatic cancer to all of his internal organs.\n\nNow, for the cancer to be this widespread, it MUST have been present for a long time even before my grandmother's funeral. That's the scientist in me talking. The timing is just an odd coincidence though. He was doing fine, grandma died, his affairs were settled, and then his body decided that \"it's time\". There is definitely more to our spirit that science does not yet fully understand. \n\nIronically, I'm boarding a plane for NYC in a few hours (and part of our visit includes an NYT tour).

Overwhelmingly, the response was quite positive, except for a couple of people who didn't understand the concept of satire.  Some asked me not to stop, so I've produced a new list for today.\n\nHowever, I can imagine that coming up with a new one of these every day could be a part-time job all by itself, and I anticipate that I won't always have the time to produce a good list every day.  Plus, I fear it would get repetitive rather fast, since the same concepts come up over and over again.\n\nWhat's more, I'll be traveling domestically next week, and I will be in Morocco for a week in early April, and although I expect to be able to do the puzzles and contribute to the comments on most, if not all, of those days, I can't see myself creating this kind of list day in and day out.\n\nSo I will commit to encore performances sporadically on days when I'm less busy, but nothing like a regular basis.\n\nI hope that will be a good balance.","createDate":"1741834131","updateDate":"1741927588","approveDate":"1741834133","recommendations":42,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140532320,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140532441","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5187856554985046}

Their marriage taught me how silly most stereotypes about gender, relations between women and men, and between spouses were.\n\nSo yeah. When mom died I was terrified my dad would deteriorate. He has some health issues of his own, so the threat seemed real. I tried to support him in any way I could, but he comes from hardy stock, the proud people of the Mazovian countryside, so emotionally he would just not open up to work out grief. Still, I started to spend as much time as I could with him, and also talking to him on the phone daily. I made sure he stayed active, and that he engaged with other people. It helped that he must have realized the risks himself. \n\nHe turned 75 last year. He is very physically active, walking as much as 12 km daily. He writes books. He meets friends and family. He is a pillar of his local community (he was elected to the disctrict council last year). He takes his health seriously.

I soon realized that I didn't know as much as I thought I knew, and I didn't know how crossword clues and answers functioned.\n\nIn a crossword, an answer is acceptable if it is in any way a possible answer to the clue.  It doesn't have to be the most common one, or the one that would come to most people first.  And often, it's very easy to verify whether the answer can fit the clue; after all, the same device you're using to write your nit can also tell you your answer.\n\nSo, let's do that.  \n\nAbout two seconds of effort produced a page listing these sites and a few others like them:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulcast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulcast</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/conjugation/english/simulcast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/conjugation/english/simulcast</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/simulcast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dictionary.com/browse/simulcast</a>\n\nAll of them say \"simulcasted\" is a past tense form of \"simulcast\".\n\nAlso, consider that each puzzle has a constructor, at least one editor, and then several test solvers.  It's inconceivable that at no point in the process did anyone bother to fact check this word.\n\nBut don't worry.  A solver called DW from NY already raised this question, and got, to this point, 61 recommendations.  \n\nAll that means is that there are 64 (including your recommender) people out there who don't know what I just told you above.\n\nTL; DR:  Simulcasted is proper.","createDate":"1741892391","updateDate":"1741916416","approveDate":"1741892393","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140552040,"parentUserDisplayName":"Domenic","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140553773","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7399412989616394}
