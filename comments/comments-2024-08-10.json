I often think about such comments. Something about today - the clues in this puzzle, my mood? - means here is where I’m going to reply.\n\nLike any good geo- or egocentrist, we are each inescapeably in thrall of our self-consciousness. I am guessing that most people are like me: I imagine I “know what I’m doing” and take a little pride in my thinking skills when I think about a clue and then think of the answer. But actually, I am clueless about how thinking works. Though I have no idea how I “come up with” the correct answers even when I am consciously thinking of them (or, for that matter how I fail to when thinking just as hard), it is only occasionally that I become “aware” of this ineffable experience of suddenly receiving (or not) conscious grasp of a thought or idea or fact. The answers simply arrive in a kind of cognitive dumb-waiter, and are handed to me. The frustration is that sometimes the dumb-waiter is on a different schedule than “I” am.\n\nMinds amaze me - conscious, subconscious, and everything in between.","createDate":"1723295956","updateDate":"1723411546","approveDate":"1723295960","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135341513,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135345180","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-10","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6051918864250183}
