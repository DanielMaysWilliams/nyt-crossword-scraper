So simple, yet, for me at least, when I uncovered the revealer, I laughed with surprise.  That’s one of Crosslandia’s great moments.\n\nAnd what a heartwarming backstory, where Patrick, who had never made a crossword puzzle, decides at the beginning of this year that he is going to get one published in the NYT. He seeks help, and experienced constructor John kindly takes him under his wing, and before the year is out, Patrick’s wish comes through!  A real-life happy ending,\n\nI love the theme echo in the puzzle.  Here, the revealer is three first names, and when you look around the grid, first names pop out – ten of them (ARI, ANN, OPIE, EDGAR, ISAAC, TAI, ABE, ALI, ADA, and KRIS)!  Plus, NAME would work as a revealer to this subtheme.\n\nI liked seeing EASE crossing EASEL, three answers that sound like letters said together (ARI, OPIE, ANY), and two palindromes whose first and last letters are the same (ADA, TNT).\n\nSo, lots of feel-good in the box today.
