It's a child's game in which the player attempts to move a number of concentric discs from one rod to another, being careful never to place a larger disc on a smaller one.  Typically, the game has five discs, and the puzzle can be solved in 31 moves, if you know what you're doing.\n\nBut why is it called the \"Tower of HANOI\"?  No one knows for sure, but my favorite theory is that there is a Hindu temple which contains a tower of 64 golden discs in which the monks are continuously working to move the discs from one to another.  When the monks finish the task, so the story goes, the current world will come to an end,...and another world will begin.\nBut surely that story is nonsense, or the world would have ended long ago, right?\nDon't be so fast!\nIf this story were true, and the monks worked around the clock and were able to move the discs at the rate of one disc per second, it would take them over 584 billion years to finish the puzzle!\n\nThat seemed impossible to me, but I did the (rather simple) calculation, and it's correct!  It's easy to see that the number of steps required doubles with the addition of each disc.  The number of steps required to move a stack of 64 discs is 2^64-1.

All MP uniforms looked like officer's ones, so the Soviets took him for an officer and loaded him into the Katyń train). He spent the rest of the war smuggling across the Generalgouvernement (formal German name of occupied Poland) border. He met my paternal grandmother, a village midwife, in a neighboring village.
