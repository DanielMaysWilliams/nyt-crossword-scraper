This is hardly even a nit, since it’s obviously an English puzzle (just like it’s an American puzzle for ZEE)—but maybe it would have been a nice educational opportunity in any case.\nAlso interesting to note that PAS means “step” in French and was originally always used with “ne”, but gradually had the meaning of “not” all by itself.\n\nFunny how Mary Poppins came up in the comments yesterday with PISH POSH and then in the puzzle today.

The ballot is lengthy — I think there are about 100 puzzles across four categories.\n\nThe puzzle descriptions are meant to simply remind you of the puzzle. We’ve done our best to make sure that all the nominated puzzles are on the ballot. Our sincere apologies if you nominated a puzzle and it’s not on the ballot.\n\nIf you vote, be sure you’ll have time to finish the ballot. As far as I can tell, there’s no way to save your choices if you start the ballot and don’t submit it. However, you’ll get an email with your votes and may be able to add votes if you’re under five in any category.  You will get a somewhat generic error message if you try to select more than five puzzles in any category. The message pops up as soon as you choose a sixth puzzle, so it’s easily fixed by deselecting one of your choices. It’s actually a pretty good way of keeping you focused on the best of the best. And if you want to be sure you’ve selected five, try choosing one more. At the end of the relevant section of the ballot, it will say “The maximum number of selections allowed is 5.”\n\nWe hope you’ll find the ballot user-friendly.

The appearance and texture of both hand-pulled and nitro-driven beer is quite different from CO2-driven beer. Nitrogen, being an inert gas, as every cruciverbalist knows, doesn't react with the beer like CO2 does. Somehow that all results in a beer with tiny little bubbles, a creamy mouthfeel, and different taste. Guinness even figured out how to deliver that in a can.

My wife and I enjoy wine, but we prefer beer. In France the selection of beers is typically very poor, and you pay through the nose for what you get. 9 or 10 Euros for nothing special? Sheesh... It's quite similar in Spain. Even though Italy is wine country like France and Spain, the beer situation is much better, for some reason. Moretti beers are quite nice, and cheap, too. AND they also come in 0,66 bottles :D\n\nŻywiec is a decent beer, but it's brewed industrially and generally frowned upon by beer snobs. I'll have it though if nothing else is available, which happens at some places, if rarely - usually at fried kiełbasa stands or some such. Also, for the past 15 years or so craft brewing has been developing in Poland, with much success, and so the big industrial breweries have been forced to introduce new beers and ales, made with some shortcuts (like using hop extract rather than proper hops), but at a much better quality than expected of such busniesses.

She convinced herself that we were doing the AMNIO to find out if the baby was gay (seriously) because my husband's brother had just come out to us. That's how we found out he was adopted.

Especially now... mine was 46 years ago. Today, you can tell so much from an ultrasound. For instance, my granddaughter had a kidney condition that would require surgery at the age of six months.

In northcentral PA where I live, the local trout stream (a small river, really) has a resident population of both ospreys and bald eagles.  The eagles are thieves mostly.  They wait for ospreys to depart with their catch...then dive on them causing the ospreys to drop their fish.  The eagles then lunch as a group.  Don't know why politics come to mind when I see that happen.","createDate":"1768245920","updateDate":"1768268998","approveDate":"1768245922","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147989762,"parentUserDisplayName":"David White","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147990155","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.81561279296875}
