There weren’t too many absolute gimmes on the downs to clue me in to two letters missing, nor enough gimmes on the acrosses to make it obvious right away. Sure I wondered why ANGELS didn’t fit but I figured I was missing a less obvious team. Really didn’t figure it out until I read the revealer, discovered something was up with all the Down answers, got OBAMA and said HELMET had to fit, saw the HE in the clue, filled in FIRSTTWOLETTERS, and then it was an easy themeless with the first two letters of each down clue.\n\nI can’t wait to read the comments. I won’t rag on you if you didn’t like it. I know there are purists who don’t believe in nonsense entries and we have a whole grid of them. You may feel that this was more of an exercise for the constructor than the solver, which is reasonable especially since once you get the trick it’s pretty easy. My biggest disappointment was reading the constructor’s notes—I give points for creativity and difficulty, but if Jesse really stuck existing clues into a computer program and then picked a grid he liked, that’s a major downer for me (no pun intended). I know that’s still not an inconsequential feat at all, but I would love to have heard how he painstaking devised original clues and threw some out because they didn’t work, etc.\n\nStill, bottom line I enjoyed the puzzle and solving it so that’s still a thumbs up from me, and it was a clever idea and thought experiment.","createDate":"1758769756","updateDate":"1758829817","approveDate":"1758769758","recommendations":8,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"7991585484571440","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.45885348320007324}

The across entries were easy enough to provide me with enough letters for the downs to figure out what was going on very quickly. The fill was mercifully quite light on arcane trivia. The result? A solve in Tuesday/Wednesday time without lookups. Actually, I found this easier than both Tuesday and Wednesday this week.\n\nI have a feeling I have seen THREEPEAT in these puzzles before, but of course I didn't remember what it was. Once I got it from crosses I looked it up. Winning three championships in a row. Ok, that makes sense. We don't have a word for it in Polish - we handle it descriptively.\n\nThe most confusing entry of the whole puzzle for me was TRIPLEA (another solution I got from crosses only). I could not parse it, at all. What on Earth is a triplea, I though. Is it a brand? Of course it's not covered by the column so I googled it. Oh, TRIPLE A! However, the first dozen or so answers in Google are about AAA the game engine. Now I seem to recall AAA being an American roadside assistance thing or some such?\n\nI also don't get \"Scratch and save\" solving to SCRIMP. Any help? I don't understand what the word means and thus also how it relates to its clue.\n\nLucyfer the puppy's breeder sent us pictures of his grandfather. Wow. That's one huge poodle!

Frustration #3.\n\nOK, I've got it:  FIRST TWO LETTERS.  You mean *every* down answer is missing its FIRST TWO LETTERS???  That's gonna slow me down, but that's OK. I can do this.  Frustration #4.\n\n\"And when,\" you ask, \"did you figure out that the FIRST TWO LETTERS of the clue supplied the FIRST TWO LETTERS of the answers?\"  Oh, about two minutes after I finished the puzzle.

On a Thursday, you can’t really be sure of the number of letters in the answer (especially on this Thursday with regards to the down answers - until you figured out the trick).\n\nThe only real gimme is one that has only one possible answer. Or maybe one that you can be very, very sure of. But then if the crosses aren’t working, is it a gimme?  Maybe you’re missing something. \n\nBefore figuring out the trick, I had RAT at 33 across (that ended up being correct). But 35 down “enter into a plot?” with 4 letters seemed very likely to be BURY - much more likely than the generic RAT. In a normal puzzle I would have thought BURY was a gimme.

The revealer could be anywhere, but they are usually toward the bottom and reference the grid in some way. If you identify the revealer clue, that should narrow the possible tricks for the puzzle.
