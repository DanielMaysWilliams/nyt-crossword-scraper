This year, however, I won't be able to run or participate in the process because it's been an extremely busy year for me, and I haven't done enough crosswords to know which should qualify. I kept meaning to get back in and play catch up in time to run the contest, but at this point, have to admit it's too late to get almost a years worth of crosswords caught up on. My sincere apologies.\n\nAll is not lost, however, I am counting on my very able and competent partners who have been heavily involved in this process to run this year's POY. First and foremost, I'm counting on Puzzlemucker to take the helm.  I'm also hoping Cat Lady Margaret and Eric Hougland will pitch in and make this work. Starting later in the year would work better as December puzzles will get a fairer shot at being nominated.\n\nPUZZLEMUCKER\nCAT LADY MARGARET\nERIC HOUGLAND\n\nPlease read the above. I'm counting on you guys.\nWould have loved to do this as usual, but seriously, life been lifin', and I've had an unbelievably hectic year. \nAgain, counting on you, thanks guys!","createDate":"1733009628","updateDate":"1733124939","approveDate":"1733009632","recommendations":34,"replyCount":14,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137969190","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5682919025421143}

I know my failures are on me, but that does not mean I have to like them. \n\nNot only was today's puzzle full of trivia, it also used some pretty strange words I have not picked up in my 38-ish years of learning English: SILAGE and CUTUP confused me, and BASAL metabolism (what is that?) crossing with TAUPES was my undoing. I had an \"o\" in place of the A. Looked good enough for (apparently slightly uneducated, despite my doctorate) me. That crossing was one of the reasons I gave up and turned on autocheck.\n\nI would also appreciate it please if the community explained the following clues to me:\n\nBusinessperson bringing in beaucoup bucks - RAINMAKER? What are beaucoup bucks and what is a rainmaker, other than a kind of shaman?\n\nGrumpy friend - DOC?\n\nFit for service - ONEA? Should I be parsing that as One A?

I only needed to hear it once in my youth and I was a fan.  It’s just too much fun to say and see.\n\nBefore today, there was never a Zamboni themed crossword, and I can imagine a dry version – a tribute puzzle with the revealer of ZAMBONI and theme answers that give bits of its history and function.\n\nBut look at what John did.  It’s as if he said, “How can it be done right, where future constructors don’t even consider making a new Zamboni puzzle?”\n\nTo my mind, his going from a bald vague ZAMBONI idea – “It’s a fun word, how do I turn it into a fun puzzle?” – to an actual concept – having a closed-off rink in the center, a passel of smile-producing punny Zamboni references scattered about, then rewarding the (online) solver with a scampering Zamboni doing its thing … well, that was brilliant.\n\nTurning this into a Sunday grid took impressive talent as well – I mean, all the clever theme answers are symmetrical, for heaven’s sake, and the isolated ICE block has that sweet clue twist as well.  For pop, John threw in eight debut NYT answers, including the lovely CLEAN SHEETS and the most lovely SMOOTH OPERATOR.\n\nThis was an experience as well as a fill-in-the-boxes, and you nailed it, John.

He responded that these terms would also be included in future editions of various Random House dictionaries.\n\nMy children later gave me a paperback edition and circled “Zamboni” with an arrow pointing to the notation “look what you did.”\n\nYears later I heard a strange Ford truck radio commercial that explained their truck was powerful and reliable, just like the ice resurfacing machines manufactured by the Zamboni family.

Finding that early on was fun!! \n\nThat said, I don't seem to have any fondness for ZAMBONIS. I mean, I don't dislike them. I find that I have zero feelings about them. \n\nStill, Ioved seeing my friends from MST3K! I have so many good memories of watching it with non-robot friends every week, back in the day! \n\nI finished in decent time, under average, most of which was spent in the far north because of placing nobleGAS instead of INERTGAS at 14D and backPEDAL instead of SOFT at 4D. I eventually ripped it all out and started over up there. \n\nWhen I didn't get the gold star right away, I didn't feel like spending more time on it, so I did a reveal and found that I had SsH at 12 down, leading to ADAMSMITS. I would have caught that one if I've had felt like fly specking. Also had NENaS at 67D. I didn't know the West Side story actor, and I had truly been flummoxed about 67D, which I'd expected to be niños but couldn't be because of 71A IDLE. Guess I only know enough Spanish to be dangerous! Also, the Spanish I know from my sort of home away from home in Honduras is often different from what I learned in high school Spanish. \n\nAnyhow, glad so many had such fun today!!

The purpose of these lots is to reduce congestion at arrival sections by preventing cars from continuously circling around the airport or waiting on the sides of highways to avoid paying fees at the airport parking lots. Once the passenger's flight lands, after they collect their luggage and are ready to be picked up, they call the person waiting in the cell phone lot.
