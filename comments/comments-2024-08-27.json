Breeding season will bring emus together (after a prolonged mating ritual) and pairs will stay together until the male begins to incubate the eggs. At that point the female typically departs to mate with other males and lay additional eggs in another male’s nest. Male emus will incubate 5- 15 avocado-colored eggs for approximately 48-56 days. During incubation theses fathers never leave the nest and therefore may lose up to a third of their body weight (they can't eat, drink or relieve themselves).

Alas, a letter too long, but soooooooo close.\n\nI liked the sprinkling of answers I didn’t know – MANDELBROT (as clued), EDNA MODE, and THISBE – not only for the TIL, but also for keeping my brain engaged. Regarding MANDELBROT, I hadn’t heard of the mathematician, but I knew the word from childhood, where my grandma made mandelbrot cookies, crispy almond-flavored delicacies.\n\nEDNA MODE is what I shot into after filling in that answer, with my brain calling out Ferber!, St. Vincent Millay!, not to mention Krabappel! of \"The Simpsons\", and Turnblad! of \"Hairspray\".\n\nSome sweet serendipities: Names not clued as names (EARL, RONA, and ARTE), and reversal echoes (ACNE echoed by a backward INCA, and RONA echoed by a backward ANWAR).  Also, the two middle B initials for GOODE and MANDELBROT.\n\nThus, a splendid outing for me, a high-quality puzzle which makes this debut so promising.
