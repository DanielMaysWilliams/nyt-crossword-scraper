I was able to complete the strip running from NE to SW almost on my own, with just two lookups for DODGERS and HAINES, but the NW and SE corners defeated me.\n\nTo deal with those I looked up the ending of the song title - I was missing A KITE. I saw Mary Poppins, once, probably 35 years ago, and I remember nothing about it. It's just not really part of Polish culture.\n\nI've never heard of FREESTONE - I suspected what it might be once I got FREES___, but I looked up the ending to make sure.\n\nMAIN ST stumped me. The \"on signs\" part of the clue misled me - in Europe it is common for a symbol of concentric circles to represent town center on roadsigns, and I fixated on iconography rather than words. Btw, our streets generally have fancy names, not practical ones like in the US. Thus few settlements have a Main St, at all - it will often be Warszawska (Warsaw St) outside Warsaw.\n\nI also looked up PAC and CRISPED. As for bacon, strips of it were unknown over here before 1989. We have always consumed pork belly, of course, but usually smoked, then diced and fried, as an element of sauces or with scrambled eggs. Rashers came with democracy and market economy, but they are still used only occasionally, like in burgers or to wrap dates or tiny sausages for party snacks.\n\nI liked the puzzle and its clueing. It was simply too hard in places for me as a Polish non-native speaker of English - not a complaint at all, just fact.","createDate":"1746859380","updateDate":"1746960801","approveDate":"1746859382","recommendations":42,"replyCount":24,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142031409","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5157932639122009}

And to somehow have retained the memory of MLB teams.

It tickles me that I can finish these without lookups. I used to think you had to know all the answers in order to do that. Nope. You just have to use crosses, logic, and knowledge of how words and names generally work. Also, confidence that the answers will come and patience to let your brain take as much time as it needs.
