As others have noted, GROK is familiar to solvers of a certain age. When I was in high school, in the late 60s, someone would read Stranger in a Strange Land, recommend it with cultish enthusiasm to his or her friends, and before long everyone would be overusing GROK until it became tiresome. Half a century later the word remains fully part of my passive vocabulary but not, fortunately, part of my active one. I have a feeling that if I ever reread Stranger I would detest it now as much as I loved it then. GORP, on the other hand, is one of those terms that crossword puzzles rescue from the fraying edge of memory’s fabric. “Oh yeah, I’ve heard that before.” I appreciate that, and I resolve to use GORP (the word, not the substance) once today before letting it drift back to the periphery.","createDate":"1718711366","updateDate":"1718731435","approveDate":"1718711369","recommendations":7,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133978363","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-18","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7379304766654968}
