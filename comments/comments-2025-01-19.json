Or of aeternall. The only way it would move the Google Ngram Viewer needle would be when new editions of Tennyson‚Äôs ‚ÄòEnglish Idyls‚Äô were digitized. But here we are, celebrating its 99th appearance in the NYT. Noah Webster is doing cartwheels in his resting place. Unnecessary double Ls enjoyed a special place in his craw. \n\nEven Tennyson didn‚Äôt stay faithful to his IDYLS, He turned right around (we call it a UEY in common xword junk fill) and we got his ‚ÄòIDYLLS of the King‚Äô just a couple of decades later. You could say he got right, er, past oral influences. (Go ahead, groan away.)\n\nLike all misguided things, we got IDYL from the French who, in the wild and orthographically crazy 17th c., spelled it as idyle instead of idylle, and for a couple hundred years IDYL was good enough. Blount‚Äôs and Phillips‚Äôs early English dictionaries in the 1650s gave us IDYL; Noah Webster gave us IDYL in 1806. But then the Victorians said, ‚ÄúOoh, Hellenism! What a bright and shiny thing.‚Äù And they trudged out the Greek eid≈≠ÃÅllƒ≠on to bring IDYL back to its classical roots. Tennyson was thus corrupted in 1858, and the OED published the fascicle with IDYLL in 1899. \n\nNoah would have disagreed. He thought silent letters superfluous. He said that if we were to honor Greek etymology, then we should have ‚Äúfyzzic, karacter, [and] korus.‚Äù\n\nBut crossword puzzles are keeping IDYL alive.","createDate":"1737293763","updateDate":"1737352826","approveDate":"1737293764","recommendations":20,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139106181","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7063345313072205}

I had a couple other hangups that I was able to work out, but they held me up.

I've NEVER seen on like this. A Sunday from May 22, 1977 by Maura B.

For example, as best I can: \n\nThe clue for 25a was just two check marks with a few spaces between them. And the answer was:\nSEPARATECHECKS\n\nAnd then - the clue for 30a was 0 (zero) above a long line, and under that line were: \n\nB.A.    and  L.L.D. \n\nAnd the answer was TWODEGREESBELOWZERO\n\nAnd it gets even weirder than that.

I was a very good student in general, and I aced almost all of my courses, but math was my nemesis. I could not see how any of it would be of any use to me in practice, except the most basic stuff. And sure enough, beyond occasionally having to be able to add or subtract some numbers, or to understand percentages and the decimal system, I have never needed to know any math in my quite successful and fulfilling life.

Both forms showed up in 2024. Obscure in real life, yes, but you should put that in your back pocket because it'll appear again.  \n\nAs for NENES, not slang, as Rita says, but just informal.  If you have dealt with Hispanic parents in your travels, as I have, you'll find it to be very commonly used.  And of the 23 times in the Modern Era (out of 51 total), NENES in the plural has always been clued to Spanish babies, and never to Hawaiian geese.  (Before that, there was a fairly even split.  I imagine it was probably not a correct plural, so it was abandoned at some point.)\n\nASSAM is a tea- and silk-producing state of Northern India that has appeared 218 times.
