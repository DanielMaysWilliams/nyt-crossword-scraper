I worked from top to bottom and caught the trick with the first aquarium, so it wasn't too difficult to complete the other themers as soon as one of the major words became apparent. Having \"THE\" in all the answers was a definite help as well. The Lorax was something we never got around to reading, or watching, so that answer depended on the crosses.\n\nThought of civil engineering first, so put in Tyco (construction vehicles), but then remembered K'NEX, which fit much better. I'm intrigued by stories of people who've built things with their toys which have become successful. The Disney Parks ride Soarin' was developed and demo'd with an Erector Set, as an example. For 11D, my first thought was about my grandparents' pump organ, which I got a few chances to play notes on, but then figured out it was probably HI-HAT.\n\nAn enjoyable workout, which actually came in somewhat under my average. Thanks, Spencer.","createDate":"1711854192","updateDate":"1711956189","approveDate":"1711854194","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132214990","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-31","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.908374547958374}

Fairly mellow compared to recent Sundays, but that section around CLOROX fizzled me for the last 10-15 minutes.
