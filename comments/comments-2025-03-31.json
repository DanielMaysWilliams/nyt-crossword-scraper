Especially in the Winter, boy does it get freezing up there. Beanies to the rescue! But I also wore a wig which not only kept the head warm, it earned me so many compliments on my beautiful hair and/or beautiful haircut, I would laugh the rest of the day. \n\nAnd, to wrap up the topic, as the grand-daughter of a bald man, the niece of a bald man, and the sister of a bald man, all of which didn't/don't have the option of regrowing hair, I just want to say, \"Bald men of this Earth, I salute you\" (and let me start with the baldest of heart-throbs...Sir Patrick Stewart.) \n\nFor today, the song I'm inspired to post is not  \"LET it be,\" gorgeous as it is, nor an AFRO-CUBAN one, but rather Radiohead's beautiful \"Street Spirit (FADE Out)\" –\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LCJblaUkkfc?si=I70lE05zDbPhLT4U\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/LCJblaUkkfc?si=I70lE05zDbPhLT4U</a>\n\nCongratulations on your NYT puzzle debut, Ryan, as well as on your persistence and resilience.

A very evocative puzzle for a Monday, especially the mention of Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\".\n\nThe most famous Regionalist painters, Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, and Grant Wood, were all associated with specific regions of the American Midwest. From Missouri, Kansas and Iowa, respectively.\n\nCurry and Benton both have extensive murals in the Kansas and Missouri statehouses.  Both grappled over the realistic content of their works with unrealistic state legislatures.\n\nCurry's famous \"Tragic Prelude\" was on the rock band Kansas'\ndebut album in 1974.  \n\nGrant Wood's murals are in the Parks Library on the Iowa State University at Ames.\n\nCurry was appointed as the first artist-in-residence at the College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which built him a small studio.  Many of his works are in your local museums.  The Emancipation Proclamation is in the Reading Room, Law Library, University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nMany more of Curry's works are in the Whitney Museum of American Art in NYC.  \n\nAll three of these artists were controversial and at times New Yorkers, Parisians and attended The Kansas City Art Institute and the Institute of Art Chicago.\n\nThomas Hart Benton's most famous students were Dennis Hopper and Jackson Pollock.  I didn't know Pollock was also raised in Iowa.  \n\nIn Curry's Tornado over Kansas, I always imagine myself as the kid carrying the cat, heading for the root cellar because that's how it was.","createDate":"1743472009","updateDate":"1743495314","approveDate":"1743472011","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141049686","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-31","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8430911898612976}
