Although I correctly entered 48D, I had Oliver North confused with Oliver Stone, so the connection to the theme at first made no sense. Both Olivers, as it happens, are associated with late 20th-century conspiracies, real or imagined (North for his role in Iran-Contra, Stone as screenwriter and director of “JFK“). There used to be a professor of ancient and modern languages at Urbana-Champaign with the palindromic name REVILO Oliver. One of my college pals did graduate work with him. When he wasn’t parsing Vedic sutras, Oliver was busy purveying exotic conspiracy theories, most having to do with an ethno-religious group plotting to rule the world. Eventually, Oliver’s notions proved too extreme even for the Birch Society, and he died a lonely man.
