A correction on the idea of “half life”. Astatine’s half life of 8.1 hours means that if somehow you managed to get one gram of astatine then after that time (8.1 hours) one half of it would have decayed leaving you with 500mg of astatine and 500mg of mainly bismuth. After another 8.1 hours the another half of the astatine would have decayed leaving you with 250mg. Another 8.1 hours 125mg and so on until you have a vanishingly small amount left.","createDate":"1747371176","updateDate":"1747444300","approveDate":"1747371176","recommendations":9,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142168215","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.844876229763031}

I almost managed to fill the grid without outside help. After staring at the area directly S and SE for several minutes, however, I looked up the LA attraction and the element. Once I did, I realized I probably knew \"The GETTY\". The name rings a bell, anyway, but I can't say I really know what it is. I'll look it up.\n\nBtw, I enjoyed our two visits to the US, and there are some places I would still like to see there, but LA was never on the list. I think pop culture may be to blame - all I know about LA is its horrible traffic, crime, and the painful contrast between extreme wealth and abject poverty: all movie and TV tropes.\n\nAnyway, back to the puzzle. The element ASTATINE I've never heard about. It sounds like medication rather than anything else.\n\nI figured out other unknowns on my own. The area directly E was tough: I knew neither WES nor KINTE, and SHAG I understand only the British way, or as a description of a kind of carpet.\n\nNever having seen Peanuts I only got ADULT with many crosses. I did not know LOSE A TURN might mean a tough draw: in fact, I still don't quite get it.\n\nI knew TAFFY (from video games) but I realized we don't have it in Poland, I think. Wikipedia has no Polish article on it, anyway, and the description doesn't match anything I've ever eaten over here. Some translate it as the familiar \"ciągutka\" (literally: stretchy one), but I the details don't match: ciągutka is always milky, and it's not fluffy.","createDate":"1747372164","updateDate":"1747444485","approveDate":"1747372164","recommendations":21,"replyCount":15,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142168308","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7802068591117859}

I’ve noticed that the puzzles — especially the Sunday, which used to have maddeningly challenging trick themes — have gotten significantly easier. Fridays and Saturdays, which used to take a long time to solve, have gotten less complex and easier. The references, too, used to be slightly more highbrow. Obviously I am more practiced now than I was in school, but I did wonder if this was a concerted effort by the editors of the NYT puzzle pages to be more inclusive, as the games can now be played online by people who don’t necessarily read the paper. I’m all for inclusivity, I just wonder if the Monday-Saturday difficulty has been thrown off. Am I imagining this?” — Zoe, New York City\n\nFrom Christina:\nI sometimes solve crosswords from the archives, and I have noticed this myself. Puzzles from 10 years ago often take me much longer than those from today. There have been a few changes. One is that, with crossword software being much more developed and accessible than it used to be, more constructors can make clean grids. Good software and word lists make it much easier to create a grid without obscure entries or tough vocabulary. European rivers, ancient pots and extinct birds\n that used to appear frequently are no longer staples.\n\n(To be continued)","createDate":"1747409982","updateDate":"1747446861","approveDate":"1747409982","recommendations":12,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142177144","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6275697350502014}

Y'all have a lot of education and do a lot of things very well. But from my experience as a bookkeeper for the last 30 years, I can say that most (not all) CPAs make terrible bookkeepers. Why? Because they're not used to focusing on the nitty gritty details. They tend to be big picture folk, which is great, but the detritus they leave behind in QuickBooks is why I have a job in the first place. (To be fair, I've cleaned up after a lot of bad bookkeepers too.)\n\nBut back to the puzzle... not my fastest time but far from my slowest. Finished with no lookups, as usual, but did get slowed down in a few places.\n\nHad SwAt instead of SHAG for far too long because I was thinking  insects, and sports is my weakest area. Finally gave in to SHAG but didn't expect it to \"fly.\" LOSS filled in from crosses but needed the column to explain why it was correct. Needed all the crosses for ASTATINE.\n\nI figured CUBER had to do with Rubik's Cube and looked it up after the solve. Seems you don't actually have to be super fast to call yourself a CUBER.

A Sunday from April 10, 1977 by the great Frances Hansen with the title \"Scrambling around.\" 16 rebus squares in that one - all of them a rebus of 'EGG.' And four 23 letter grid-spanning theme answers, though there were lots of other answers that also used the rebus. Those grid-spanners:\n\nTHEEASTER(EGG)HUNTONTHELAWN\nAN(EGG)SWAYOFMAKINGANOTHER(EGG)\nPUTSALLHIS(EGG)SINONEBASKET\nCANAN(EGG)HEADDRAWANEASTER(EGG)\nand one more long across answer (17 letters)\nWALLSTREETLAYSAN(EGG)\n\nAnd there were several shorter across answers that also had that rebus... and, of course all the crossing down answers used it to. So... all together - 26 answers that included an EGG rebus. Don't recall seeing another puzzle with that many occurrences of the same REBUS. \n\nHere's the Xword Info link:\n\n <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=4/10/1977&g=55&d=A\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=4/10/1977&g=55&d=A</a>\n\n..","createDate":"1747418455","updateDate":"1747447646","approveDate":"1747418455","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142180797","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7205193638801575}

I remember wondering if we'd ever get the next noble gas after Radon.  Now I see it's happened.  There is evidence for about five atoms of Oganesson.
