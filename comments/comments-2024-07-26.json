Super Bowl LVIII was held in 2024.  The Roman numeral designation was specifically designed because each Super Bowl settles the championship of the previous year.  Kansas City won that game, and therefore were the 2023 NFL champions.  \n\nThat being said, there can still be some ambiguity as to whether a clue such as today's refers to the year the award was given or the year of the movie's release.  Clearly, the Academy sidesteps this issue for the most part.  However, the NYT Crossword staff is extremely consistent in their approach.  Therefore, you have two options:  complain every time such a clue appears, or just accept how they word such clues.\n\nThe editors could avoid this controversy by wording the clues differently (Best Actress RECIPIENT in 2023 or Best Actress for her 2022 film).  But they don't...so far.\n\nIt seems to me that most of the people getting peeved must be annoyed because they Googled the answer...and looked on the wrong row.
