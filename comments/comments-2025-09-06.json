It was tough but accessible. I was surprised to finish up about 25% faster than usual because there were several times I felt like I was never going to get there without help. The top was the hardest for me but I had ___ESSENTIALS so that helped a lot. Once I corrected my misspelling of KINTa, which was one of the few things I got on the first round, I was able to see more clearly and finished up to my Capt Holt dunces music! Huzzah!!\n\nGORP!! I had forgotten all about it! With the R and P in place, I was able to access it in the bingo ball spinner cage that sometimes I think of my brain as. There's a lot of stuff in there, but you just don't know what's going to come out when!\n\nThankfully though, EMEKA, STEF, and SET PIECE came from the crosses because those were definitely not in the bingo cage. \n\nI don't know, I really liked this one! Felt very fresh and sparkly. Loved seeing OCTAVIAEBUTLER in it! Of course, not a fan of the fur trade, but I do enjoy seeing FUR cross PUPPY!  And the cute clue for EEK made me chuckle out loud!  \n\n28 across had me chuckling too because it reminded the old SNL skit how if it isn't Scottish, it's crap! I'd have probably been in trouble if that was four letters for the answer. \n\nAn all around CLASS ACT of a puzzle!!

Blends vary widely but it is generally some combination of nuts, raisins, other dried fruit, and chocolate and/or candy all mixed together and carried in a snack bag. Part of the fun is picking out pieces one by one, or combining different pieces for different flavour bites as you eat. There are commercial brands/versions available. Can be bought pre-made (lots of versions  out there) or mixed at home with preferred ingredients.\n\nIts energy density makes it a favourite of campers and hikers, though that has never prevented me from eating it on a regular day at home. \n\nSome suggest GORP stands for \"good old raisins and peanuts\" (the most basic version of the snack), but others feel this is a backronym. I don't know what determines whether a snack mix qualifies as \"GORP\" versus \"trail mix\", but my gut tells me that there is some difference.
