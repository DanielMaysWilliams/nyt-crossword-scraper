The poster is dead wrong in their judgment - this puzzle is superior to most of the last year's Saturdays, despite some esoterica - but I wouldn't want anyone pandering to a constructor based on their personal history.  This thing wins on its merits and its maker's skills, and people should post their honest opinions of the puzzle (not the person), no matter how wrong they happen to be.  At least in my opinion. :)\n\n\n____________________\nJesse Goldberg 8/28/2024 for Puzzle of the Decade\n(emu filler)","createDate":"1734216599","updateDate":"1734245343","approveDate":"1734216601","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138293371,"parentUserDisplayName":"LJADZ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138298265","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5447631478309631}
