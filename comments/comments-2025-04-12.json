Also, my wife's friend's American husband worked at a MONTESSORI preschool some 8 or 10 years ago, so the name came up in conversation. Thus I was able to get it with a few crosses, even though the details of the MONTESSORI method were not known to me.\n\nI love my oldschool mortar and pestles.

Split pea soup, which I'm going to try very hard to remember the Polish name for it and look up how to pronounce it correctly, is one of those very dishes that I was speaking of that make me feel that deep connection to women in ages gone by. There's something so real and earthy and just absolutely lovely about making it all the way from scratch. Somehow it feels like love. \n\nI didn't know it was one of the staples of Polish cuisine though and I'm glad to know it now. I never had it growing up, despite the presence of a lot of other (what I think are) Polish staples, like potato pancakes, Polish sausages, pierogies, cabbage rolls, and Grandma's famous poppy seed roll, which I can't remember the name for, but that was a staple for sure for holidays....   \n\nBut the thought of pea soup didn't sound good to me. When I found out that my husband liked it, I decided to make it and ended up really liking it too.\n \nI use a hearty ham bone instead of the sausage and bacon but also loads of veggies.
