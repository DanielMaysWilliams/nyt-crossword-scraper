At risk of sounding elitist: “on toe” is not really a ballet term. “En pointe” is the term, and the shoes are pointe shoes, not toe shoes. In my experience of the (professional) ballet world, “on toe” is the mark of the amateur. Yes, large swaths of Americans probably heard “on toe” at their local childhood dance academies. But it’s not the accepted term. \n          I’m making myself cringe, but I’ve seen this clue several times now - perhaps an “informally”, or “Americanized ballet term”, or….? I dunno.

(East Java = \"JATIM\", etc.) The Timorese call it \"Timor-Leste\" using the Portuguese, whom they hate less than the Indonesians; they were colonized longer by the former but more brutally, at least in recent times, by the latter.\n\nThe name Timor itself may derive from Portuguese  \"temer\" meaning \"to fear\".  Presumably the Timorese were seen as seen as pretty scary, being darker and fiercer than some other islanders -- they are more of the Melanesian type vs. Polynesian, but who knows.  The other terms for the directions in Indonesian/Malay are clearly based from the peninsula, with Indian influence:  \"south\" is \"selatan\", from \"selat' meaning \"strait\", as in the Straits of Melaka, \"north\" is \"utara\" from Sanskrit meaning \"high\" which is what the Himalayas are to the north of India, and \"west\" is \"barat\" from Sanskrit \"bharata\" meaning India itself.

I'm from Indonesia and I grew up thinking Timor was just the name of the island and sea. It would make sense as vowel sounds do change a bit in Indonesian depending on the region you're in and prior to a standardization of spelling that happened in the 1940s there was inconsistency. @MarkGawron as to where the other direction names come from and the many other sources of words in Indonesian it is a function of Indonesian deriving from the trading language \n/lingua franca of the region and absorbing words from Portuguese, Arabic, Sanskrit, etc etc. It also means that Indonesian is very stripped down with no cases and tenses!","createDate":"1708578450","updateDate":"1708578452","approveDate":"1708578452","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131314706,"parentUserDisplayName":"Patricia Henry","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131330012","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8844313025474548}
