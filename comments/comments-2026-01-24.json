In this case, it was the SE corner.\n\nLike Caitlin, I had BANANA, but I didn't have BEANIE, because I already had THOR and NEE, and also because a BEANIE doesn't wind around the head.  I couldn't come up with TURBAN because it wouldn't come to me that they're wrapped.   \n\nInstead of MUNDANE, I had PROSAIC. I didn't know what property tungsten had, how to end AVENGERS..., HALLOWEEN..., KISS..., SHOW... and ONLINE...\n\nI also had NEAT for [Swell].  For [Roll over], I tried REACT.  \n\nI had no idea what [Knocks the top off of] was, but once I took a chance on SHOWBOATS, MOWS became obvious. Off just the N in HALLOWEEN, I guessed DENSE for the tungsten property, and saw DEN for the winter home.  With the M and the N in place, PROSAIC turned into MUNDANE. By then, I saw TURBAN, and after that, the two  things I didn't actually know for sure came to light:  KISS ARMY and AVENGERS ENDGAME.  Now, HALLOWEEN PARTY and ONLINE CASINOS fell into place.  By that point, TENPIN fell into place on its own.\n\nThis was the rare corner where I really had to play around with the answers to finally arrive at the right ones.  But I didn't panic.  I have convinced myself that the NYT cannot throw anything at me that I can't eventually solve*, so I just kept plugging away.  \n\n\n* I say this because I don't believe in Naticks.

Theories abound--perhaps the bobcat was a totemic animal, or their fierceness in warfare was like unto wildcats, or on account of the raccoon tails they sported on their chapeaux; or perhaps they liked David Bowie*; or . . .\n\nUnfortunately, we can't ask the Erie, who were extirpated in the mid17th c. in a genocidal war against the Iroquois. (We imagine the First Nation peoples as all living in harmony with the environment, and each other, when the truth was anything but; and first-contact Europeans were often embroiled into conflicts which had been simmering for centuries.)\n\nOn old maps of Nouvelle France, Lake Erie is sometimes named Lac du Chat, and the archipelago at the western end--Kelleys and the Bass Islands in Ohio, and Pelee in Ontario--were known as the Îles aux Serpents, from the numerous watersnakes that lived there. Like the Erie, the watersnakes were almost extirpated, down to an estimated population of 1500 in 1999, but through protection, their numbers have increased to 12M+. Bobcats, like most apex predators, have never been numerous, but their population seems to be stable.\n\n*<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1O4iZOt23Q&list=RDi1O4iZOt23Q&start_radio=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1O4iZOt23Q&list=RDi1O4iZOt23Q&start_radio=1</a>","createDate":"1769257037","updateDate":"1769343760","approveDate":"1769257038","recommendations":32,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148327581","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8316406607627869}

Mann uses the word “einfachen”.  Dictionaries give simple, uncomplicated, and straight forward.  Translators give “simple-minded” [L-P] and “perfectly ordinary” [Woods].  I will argue that his character in constrained by this place and time, but that he is in no way an ordinary man.  *** I’ll leave my uniqueness counterargument until you’ve finished the book. (I don’t know how much you’ll be influenced by  L-P’s ’s translation. It’s been written, perhaps unkindly, that she hadn’t read the entire novel before beginning to translate it. I know that her translation of Death in Venice mis-portrays a key character in a way that changes the psychological thrust of the book.) I’ll say this: Keep an eye out for narrative feints. \n\n2.  The Castorps are not aristocrats.  They have been of the merchant class since 1650, the first date etched on the family Christening Basin.  The six generations listed there have survived despite momentous changes in the outside world.  (The end of the 30 years war, the rise of Prussia under Frederick the Great, and the unification of Germany under Bismark).  Hamburg has remained a self-governing city-state.

It’s important to keep in mind what history has laid at the Bildungsbürgertum’s door following the 18th c. and WWI (remember that Mann published the book after WWI), and later again in the wake of WWII. \n\n3. I would describe Hans' character as constrained by middle-class morality and manners. 4-6 show . . . H's uniqueness. ***. 3. The morality of the Bildungsbürgertum was very aesthetically mediated. Manners  were key. Hans is a decent man, but can his decency make him dangerous? It makes him maximally receptive, but does it make him decisive? \n\n4.  He is an orphan.  He has lost mother, father, and guardian grandfather within the two and a half years before the age of eight.  We are told little of his education other than eight semesters at technical colleges ending at age 22.  He has “never met a literary man\".  (I will find more when  I get to later chapters.  Spoiler: I've heard that the first appearance of “the pencil” will occur while he is away at boarding school.)  *** A lack of a humanistic education may make a young person morally bland, don’t you think? Still a blank slate, impressionable? As an orphan, by whom is his character being shaped? Mann doesn’t present Hans’s orphanhood as individuating, but functional. It frees him from binding obligations, removes inherited ideological commitments, makes him available for influence.","createDate":"1769264317","updateDate":"1769278853","approveDate":"1769264318","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148326460,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148329480","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7030015587806702}

He has money, a technical education, social legitimacy, no urgent attachments. He embodies the rootless, late-imperial bourgeois subject. \n\n5. Some personal quirks:  He is angered by the slamming of doors and scandalized by the “activities” of the couple in the next room.  He says things like “I really like the sight of a coffin.” and “Funerals are more uplifting than church.” *** These might be quirks today, but were they in pre-WWI Germany? He has an aversion to orderliness disrupted by noise or, as we’d say, TMI. And death, like other experiences, is mediated aesthetically in a culture that has removed itself from its immediacy. Think of Hans’s first aestheticized encounter with death, his grandfather’s: He experiences it as beautiful form (ritual, objects, atmosphere), not rupture or grief; something he can contemplate without cost. He is not morbid; he’s a product of his time and place. \n\n6. Whether the door slammed by Mme. Chauchat (hot cat) is a Freudian symbol of sexual rejection remains to be seen. *** What if Hans stands for the West in the 1910s and Chauchat for the East? Not the Far East but the one represented at the time by Russia. You could read the “hot cat” as the allure of the exotic, forbidden East for Mann’s and Castorp’s West, with the East slamming its doors (loudly) in the face of the curious (and culturally restrained) West, remaining opaque behind the veil of a language Hans doesn’t speak.","createDate":"1769264565","updateDate":"1769314058","approveDate":"1769264567","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148326460,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148329635","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7237258553504944}

Nobody assumed anyone's gender unless they knew them. And there were all those Kelly's and Leslie's to deal with.\nAcknowledging a person's right to self-presentation seems consistent with many other rights that we're used to. So why does this one rile us up do?\nI think in part this relates to how deeply we value sexuality. Sex is literally the most profound impulse we have. Every society I've ever heard of has taboos around sexuality. Playing around with it is destabilizing in many ways. It's  just too scary for many of us if we can't clearly and immediately identify someone's gender. (As a Jew, I know that one of the most aggravating circumstances for anti-Semites is that we can 'pass'.) \nWhat if we guess wrong? What if we're attracted to someone of the 'wrong' gender?Because it's sex, unlike -- say -- simply mistaken identity, we can't just say 'Oops' and move on. More powerful stuff is at play.\nBut that's a WE PROBLEM. Our discomfort can't be solved by redirecting it at those whose existence upsets our norms.\nWhew! I'm sorry this was so long.
