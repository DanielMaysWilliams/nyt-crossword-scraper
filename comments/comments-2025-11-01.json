It had a lot of unusual entries, but I was put off by a lot of short gimmes that were very atypical for a Saturday—ERA, ETD, PEDI, AILED, MIC, IMHO, SRS, ANOS, on and on, which were all early week level and which they didn’t even try to dress up. On the other hand there were lots of things I didn’t know—TILTEDARC, YELICH, PEOPLESELBOW and others I knew but were fun to suss out. Incidentally I’m not in the least put out by a WWE clue that I had no idea about nor would ever care—I could guess ELBOW and how many words have an EO in the middle? (although how PEOPLESELBOW can be a thing is beyond me). Happy to see the shout out to AGOUTIS and Andrzej, don’t even get me started on ALPHABITS, it was a cereal with letters and the idea is you could spell stuff in your bowl (although I doubt many kids were writing adventure novels). I hope everyone is happy with the spelling of FLIERS today. I was sort of flummoxed by COPYPASTE—it’s really two commands isn’t it, we just call it that because we do one after the other? (Correct me if I’m wrong). Finally I was stuck in the middle for a bit, I had BUTT before LATE, BIBCOAT sounded like a thing that could be a smock, and RIVETER eluded me (because yeah, I hope they aren’t having to RIVET too often).

Some folks know a lot of urban myths; I’m more of an Urban myths (and random facts) person. \n\nFor example, if you’re Catholic and you’ve ever stopped to admire the beautiful silver liturgical vessels, you owe Pope Urban I thanks. Prior to the 3rd c. upgrade he instituted, clay or wood vessels were used for mass. \n\nAnd in a twist of serendipity only a crossword puzzle can provide, we know this thanks to the letters of St. Jerome, who also (oddly enough for someone fixing to be beatified later) wrote about Catullus and his beloved Clodia. And Catullus, of course, is the author of the oft-quoted Odi et Amo—featured indirectly in yesterday’s puzzle. \n\nŌdī et amō. Quārē id faciam fortasse requīris.\nNesciŏ, sed fierī sentiō et excrucior.\n\nI hate and I love. Why do I do this, perhaps you ask. \nI know not, but I feel it happening and I am in torment. \n\nNot everything Catullus wrote was so tortured—or so tame. Before the (in)famous Clodia, whom he referred to as Lesbia in his poems, put him through his paces, she had inspired him to write in an altogether different spirit. Yet, very democratically, he merited a mention in St. Jerome’s writings—just like Urban I. Fast forward a couple millennia, and Catullus and Urban are back together again, this time in two back-to-back NYT crossword puzzles. Like I said: serendipity. \n\nAnd it warms the cockles of my dusty volume-loving heart.","createDate":"1761968886","updateDate":"1762085867","approveDate":"1761968887","recommendations":61,"replyCount":14,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146341600","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5133052468299866}

I merely wanted to express my aesthetic appreciation of its rites, because they are beautiful. \n\nAs for Urban I. Yes, there are plenty of myths swirling about him, but his instituting the use of silver vessels for liturgy is somewhat likely not to be one, which is why I’d picked it as an interesting tidbit. It comes from Liber Pontificalis, whose entries for the early popes primarily list two kinds of details: (a) Administrative or liturgical innovations (constituit ut…) and (b) relics, martyrs, miracles, etc. The latter are usually anachronistic and thus easily disproved. The former, though—well, it depends. On the one hand L.P. is the first source to mention Urban I’s silver decree and this 2 centuries post facto, while contemporarily writing Hippolytus doesn’t mention it. On the other hand, the claim is chronologically credible and no other source contradicts it. So we’ve got something which is attested and, while not verifiable, is not falsifiable. It is also  historically plausible, with economic, political, and material context that fits neatly. Many such administrative “constituit” items may be retrojections, assigning later customs to early popes to lend them apostolic authority, but this one smells like the real thing (not the least because it is such a short, dry little note in the L.P.
