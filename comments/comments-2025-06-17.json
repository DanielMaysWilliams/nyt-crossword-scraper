Well, like I said, I'm unfamiliar with the product, and there was something unsatisfying about the fact there was no real connection between the \"themed\" entries and candy, as such. \n\nOh, and, I just realized Polish Santa doesn't have helpers, ELFIN or otherwise, or at least he didn't in my childhood in the 1980s. He has his flying sled and reindeer (unnamed, for us), but that's it. He puts presents under the Christmas tree on Xmas Eve (when we have an evening feast), and nobody leaves milk and cookies for him. \n\nMy parents agreed to tell me the truth as soon as I first asked if Santa was real.

Quite a BASH after I was run into while skiing at Whistler in March. Surgery left my bone-SPURred, cartilage-free femoral head in the *bucket*, which has the same number of letters as BREAST. Fortunately it wasn't a SPIRALled fracture. \n\nI usually haven't bothered with streaks, but the forced inactivity started this one and then I decided to continue. This past weekend, I was late getting to the Friday puzzle and did it in order on Saturday, before starting the Saturday one, and was rewarded with a blue star, which I think breaks the streak. In the past, I have sometimes waited two days before completing puzzles and always got the gold star as long as the puzzles were done in order. This was my understanding after reading many discussions about this in the commentariat in the past. I inquired of the NYT Games staff, and a nice woman wrote me \"... for a puzzle to count toward your streak, it must have been solved on the day of its publication before midnight without having used in-app help...It doesn't count if it 's within 24 hours unfortunately.\"\n\nI followed up with her but haven't heard back. I didn't know about the constraint of not seeking help from \"in-app\" resources, which I never look at until after completing the puzzle. Others might be interested or have some insight. FWIW I'm doing very well thanks to modern surgery!","createDate":"1750197583","updateDate":"1750207764","approveDate":"1750197583","recommendations":4,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142926334","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-17","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7201638221740723}

They believed that the earth was created on the back of a turtle, after a great tree fell from the land of the Sky People into the waters below. When the pregnant daughter of the chief fell through the hole left by the tree, the animals in the water below came together to save her. They built her a home on the back of a giant turtle, using the dirt from the fallen tree roots. Magically, this dirt expanded to cover the turtle and create the island world the Iroquois inhabited.\n\nWhile my classmates howled at the idea that anyone could believe they lived on a turtle’s back, I was struck by the realization that a myth is a myth, and so how was the Garden of Eden any more believable? Or any of the other stories? It was a huge awakening.\n\nI do think myths have their place, as a way to teach values and kind behavior.

We have the hubris to believe our particular culture will last forever.

The Oxford English Dictionary still favours -ize in British English, and it was the preferred spelling in most British \"prestige\" publications well into the 1980s. It coexisted with the Frenchified -ise spelling for centuries in British English---Johnson used both -ize and -ise rather indiscriminately in his famous Dictionary, for instance, but Noah Webster later came down heavily for -ize in his American Spelling Book.\n\nI was taught -ize at school, and still use it. And it's still frequently encountered in British publications, despite the definite shift towards -ise in recent years.

In American football, basketball and hockey, the other three major sports here, it's overtime.\n\nIn tennis, it's a tiebreaker.  In golf, it's a playoff.\n\nIn soccer, it's extra time, just like in the rest of the world, but then again, soccer is the only sport I'm aware of where the clock counts up.  And when you reach full time, you've played through the 90-minute mark, and some unknown number of minutes determined by how much time was wasted when the clock kept on running because you're not allowed to stop it.  At least in American sports, we know how much playing time is left near the end of a game.","createDate":"1750182061","updateDate":"1750202329","approveDate":"1750182062","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142914683,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142917337","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7988319396972656}
