However, in the end I managed to fill the grid in Wednesday time without any lookups. In fact, the solve took only several minutes longer than this week's overly tough Monday (which requited three Googles). So... This probably seemed like a Monday to American solvers? And possibly all native speakers?\n\nCHEATS IN was new to me, of course. Sport lingo, for almost any sport, and in any language, will never ceases to confuse me. My wife watches a lot of football (soccer), and I often ask her what the stuff the commentators are saying actually means. To me it sounds vaguely Polish, but I understand very little. The only sport I'm fluent in, in both English and Polish, is climbing. Slopers (Pol. oblaki), crimps (krawądki), slabs (połogi), fig fours, dead points, campusing, Houdini swaps, Gastons, barn doors, flags - all that means something to me.\n\nAin't it funny how FLIP PHONES are considered retro? My dad was one of the first people in our area to get a tiny Motorola flip phone, the latest model at the time, a marvel of miniaturization. It was slightly larger than a matchbox, and it weighed nothing. A shopping assistant at the local store was so fascinated by it she asked my dad to hold it 🤣. My current flagship phone weighs ca. 230g...\n\nI wanted to ask why K solved to THOU but it just dawned on me. 1k, thousand. Doh. Easy. Why was I confused about it in the first place?

RACCOONS and LIONSSHARE were especially interesting.\n\nVery easy one for me. Just half-a-minute longer than my fastest Friday ever. As I've indicated many times, large stacks consisting of familiar phrases make puzzles *much easier* for me to solve. Had the top three spanners filled in within two minutes of starting the puzzle, and the three at the bottom took just a bit longer. Spent most of my time in the mid-section of the grid.\n\nNot sure what the reaction to CHEATSIN will be, but this former infielder avers it to be valid and perfectly clued.\n\nSmiled a bit at \"Mushroom-to-be\" for SPORE. While the clue is fine, its equivalent for flowering plants might be \"Fruit-to-be\" for SEED. A rather alpha-and-omega sort of clue. (Or perhaps it's omega-and-alpha? Which came first, the mushroom or the SPORE?)\n\nNice puzzle!","createDate":"1750420622","updateDate":"1750476406","approveDate":"1750420623","recommendations":9,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142975701","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9580051302909851}
