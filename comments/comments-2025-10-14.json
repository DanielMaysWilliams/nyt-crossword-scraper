You would recognize its Polish name from alfalfa's English alternative, lucerne - we call it lucerna.\n\nAnother problem with ALFALFA for me were its crosses, or rather the tangle of a few unknowns around that spot. YASSIFY, RIFF (as clued today), and FIE were all unknown to me, or not obvious, anyway. In the end I dealt with them without lookups though.\n\nBeing totally unfamiliar with YASSIFY is probably down to my not being on any social media and not having children. That reminds me! I recently learned SIGMA from a NYT puzzle. I actually had an opportunity to use it in my 1st year uni class full of young gen Z-ers 😃\n\nOne thing I didn't like in the puzzle was the clue for LADY. That's not a title, is it? It's just a form of address for a titled woman, a countess, say - or am I wrong? It worked as a clue, I guess - it was a gimme - but it felt inaccurate to the extent of being wrong.","createDate":"1760421553","updateDate":"1760471076","approveDate":"1760421555","recommendations":9,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145916123","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8578708171844482}

A constellation is a defined region of the sky, which contains innumerable stars, visible and invisible; and asterism is a visible pattern of stars, which may be part of a constellation (the Big Dipper), or span across several constellations (the Summer Triangle).\n\nBut the clue is not completely accurate: the star Mizor, the second from the end of the \"handle,\" has a faint companion, Alcor, which would bring the count to eight. The ability to differentiate Alcor and Mizar was used as a vision test, among pre-optometrist cultures.\n\nSome fun reading today on the asterism's interpretation across various cultures. There seem to be four common traditions-- either a bear, a dipper/ladle/saucepan, a wagon/wain/chariot, or a plough. In some cases, the wagon has a specific owner: Odin, or Göncöl. But there are some other interpretations as well: the Sami, who knew of bears, but probably had little use for plows or wagons, saw it a bow; and the pre-Islamic Arabs saw it as a funeral wagon, but heading in the opposite direction, with the stars of the \"handle\" representing the mourning daughters of the deceased, following it.\n\nThe pragmatic Romans saw it seven individual oxen (\"septem triones\"), which gave us the adjective \"septentrional,\" a fancy word for \"north,\" for those who want to air their erudition.\n\nI did the work, so you don't have to.","createDate":"1760445723","updateDate":"1760483285","approveDate":"1760445724","recommendations":18,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145919410","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.889306902885437}

Please indulge me as I can finally get pedantic about the NYT crossword.  \n\nThe clue is simply wrong. A card is an indicator of an OFFENSE (some violation of the laws of the game) that is significant enough for the referee to issue a caution (yellow card) or sending-off (red card). The laws provide detailed lists of the kinds of offenses that qualify for each category of card. \n\nA PENALTY kick is awarded for a direct-kick offense committed by a player in their penalty area. Again, there is a defined list of direct-kick offenses—i.e., offenses for which the resulting restart is a direct kick.\n\nAs many others have noted, you can have a penalty kick without a card (carelessly tripping an attacker inside the penalty area, for instance) and a card without a penalty kick (recklessly tripping an attacker outside the penalty area, say). Within soccer, \"foul,\" \"offense,\" and \"penalty\" are not all synonymous with \"some generic bad thing that a player did.\" Each has a distinct definition. And no one involved in the game uses the phrase \"penalty card,\" despite what Wikipedia and other websites might say. To do so would cause confusion.\n\nAll in all, in the opinion of the referee (ITOOTR in ref lingo), this clue deserves a yellow caution card for a careless offense.","createDate":"1760457884","updateDate":"1760496966","approveDate":"1760457885","recommendations":15,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145925422","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.590980052947998}

A red CARD in soccer means ejection--\"sending off,\" as they call it--which is, in the wider world, a serious penalty.  You have to leave the pitch, you can't go back, you can't be substituted for.  In any sense of the word \"penalty,\" the player is severely penalized for their actions.  The fact that the \"Laws\" don't categorize this as a \"penalty\" is irrelevant.  (Yes, in soccer, the rulebook is call the Laws.)\n\nIt's like saying that the US consists of 46 states, not 50. Four of the constituent members of the US--Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Kentucky--officially call themselves \"commonwealths,\" not \"states.\"  But to say that they aren't states is disingenuous.  They have state police and state universities.  By any measure, they are states, even if their constitutions call them something else.  And we're not the United States and Commonwealths.\n\nSoccer is notoriously an outlier with regard to terminology:  they play on a pitch, not a field; they start (and often end) with a score of nil-nil, not zero or nothing; they play a match, not a game; they wear a kit, not a uniform.  And its clock counts up, not down, and doesn't stop when the action does.  So is it not a field?  Is a match at nil-nil not a nothing-nothing game?  Is a kit something other than a uniform?\n\nSo why wouldn't you consider an ejection a severe penalty?","createDate":"1760467582","updateDate":"1760524603","approveDate":"1760467587","recommendations":8,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145929955","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-14","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5991241335868835}
