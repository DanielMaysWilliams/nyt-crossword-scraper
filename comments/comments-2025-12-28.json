I like how that made me think.  Lovely twist, Alex.\n\nAnd lovely grid-building skills, as with 99 theme squares and 11 theme answers, the box was dense with theme, yet solved smoothly, and Alex even shoehorned in five non-theme theater-related clues/answers (Hi, @Anita!).\n\nI especially liked NEPOTISM and OUTDOORSY, and the original clues [Law, but not order] for CAREER, and [Cheep trills] for TWITTERS.\n\nFunny.  I was just thinking the other day that musicals are so unrealistic – I mean, who breaks out into song IRL in conversation? – and yet, and yet, I love so many of them, find so many magical and thrilling (Hi, @Andrzej!).

Since this is an American paper, the clue means “Word equivalent to what we call “baths” here, in Bath (i.e. the UK).”  And here, a “bath” can be the process of bathing in a tub, or the room it takes place in, or even a smaller room that doesn’t have the actual tub (here it is a euphemism). (Bath never means bathtub here.)\n\nIn ads for houses and apartments here, a property is described as having a number of full baths and half baths. The smaller ones are also called lavatories here, though infrequently.\n\nSince all that is required is partial overlap, the clue works from an American standpoint. \n\nAnd we don’t really care if LAVS is too posh, too quaint or too archaic for the good husbands and wives of Bath. All that matters is that it’s British. \n\nThe problem is that you’re only seeing it from a British standpoint. \n\nFor this kind of blindness in reverse, consider that the good folks in St. Louis, Missouri have recently taken to informally calling their fair town, unironically, the Lou. \n\nOuch.","createDate":"1766925099","updateDate":"1766951486","approveDate":"1766925100","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147599313,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jonathan Baldwin","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147599446","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5522112846374512}
