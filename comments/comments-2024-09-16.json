OKBUT, you say, didn't that movie have a lot of flaws, like Costner's accent!? What can I say, I thought Costner was dreamy and it introduced me to Rickman and Morgan Freeman!  Both ended up sort of stealing the show for me... Rickman with his portrayal of the droll and delightfully wicked sheriff of Nottingham--and his creative use for spoons--and Freeman with his response to being asked if God painted him: For certain.
