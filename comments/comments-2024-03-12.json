There were about a dozen of us, a philosopher, lawyer, plumber, dog-walker, professors, published poets, a chemist, et al. One of us would volunteer to do \"the prompt\" -- read some published work, then get everyone to do some writing on a particular theme or directive. Then we'd read what we'd written and others would comment. The rules were simple: you could only comment positively on elements that you liked or worked for you. If there was something you didn't like, you kept it to yourself. The group has morphed considerably but we still get together -- by Zoom now, all things considered. For me it's been life-changing: that simple rule, to focus only on the good stuff, has slowly rewired my critical instrumentation. Lewis from Asheville is a master at this and I suspect that he's that way for many things besides puzzles.

We were in Hawaii last summer for a friend's wedding. I'd never been before, so we went a few weeks early to visit some of the other islands. We started off on Maui and after doing the off road ATV tour (which leaves you covered in red dust that is impossible to remove) we walked around Lahaina to kill time before dinner. My wife and I enjoy looking for art that will complement our home. As we passed an art store, I saw some caricature paintings that I thought were well done. I immediately recognised one of Kevin Nealon. I then did a double take, because Kevin Nealon himself was actually standing in front of a painting of himself! We went inside, and it just so happens that he was having his art show. Kevin Nealon took up painting during the pandemic, and it turns out he is pretty good. He's done Chris Farley, Christopher Walken, Rami Malik, and Jennifer Aniston, among many others. He published a book to tell the story of why he painted each person and how he knows them, entitled \"My brushes with fame\". It's definitely worth looking up. Anyway, one painting in particular caught mine and my wife's eye, and we ended up buying it on the spot. It is the most money that we have ever dropped on an impulse purchase, and is the most expensive thing in the house (besides the cars and her engagement ring) but I have zero regrets.

I got APARTMENT and LOOK ALIVE by crosses but couldn't figure out how they worked for the clues, so they didn't help. \n\nLike many, the NE was tough for me. Started with kabob, which kept me a long time from what should have been more obvious - SPINAL. Had no hope of figuring out TECH SAVVY. I know AGHA as a last name but didn't know the honorific. With kabab still there, the other should have been obvious YO YO wasn't coming. I know thank you and you're welcome in several languages, including Russian, but apparently not Italian‚Äîat least not today because it just wasn't coming to me. No clue on Mandarin.\n\nIn the middle, I confidently had rusty (corroded) crossing with star (military accessory) and had no hope of figuring out LIE DOWN without changing them and hoping to get it from the other crosses, which made more sense once I got rid of star and rusty.  \n\nFinally resorted to a few lookups to just get done. I rarely use lookups except maybe Fri/Sat these days, so that is a bit of a bummer.\n\nI realize I need to add musical terms to my memory banks if I'm going to continue solving. By now, I'm not surprised to see what will spell out as E SHARP or whatever but didn't know or remember the symbols.
