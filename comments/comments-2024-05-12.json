It took two hours before I read the title and even more to figure out it was a rebus. It is clearly BRAVE NEW WORLD and BRAVEHEART, but how? There are certain days of the week I try for a moment, but eventually skip, reassuring myself of the tricky day of the week I am attempting, before letting go and moving on with my life. Sundays have become a safe haven over the years and I am reminded by my loving partner about it just like she reminds me to take my daily sanity pills. \"Did you do your Sunday puzzle yet?\" I can finish them. I have done it several times. Sometimes it takes both Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday. But I CAN finish them, with little to no help. Of course, I get help from the queen, but that doesn't count since we would have to ration our food together in a zombie apocalypse. I paced the house, took breaks, did some backlogged easy Mondays, and every time I returned it felt like I was being betrayed. I smiled many times at many of the clues and their answers. It gave me hope. However, for now, I must face defeat. I will revisit it. I just can't right now. I must concede and move on with my life. I have plenty of other first-world problems to face. So for now, I will double my dosage of sanity pills and hope that this is not the first sign of the zombie apocalypse.","createDate":"1715488895","updateDate":"1715834276","approveDate":"1715488898","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133149287","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9326515793800354}

It all weighed a huge amount, and on one notable occasion sank through the newly-installed floor of an auditorium causing thousands of dollars’ worth of damage. \n\nIt turned out that the promoter for that show had not read the detailed technical specifications in the contract. \n\nOn subsequent tours they would include ridiculous rider demands somewhere else in the contract. They didn’t really care about M+Ms but the idea was to test if the promoter had read the document properly. If they arrived and there were brown M+Ms in the dressing room, it was a litmus test that someone hadn’t read the contract closely so they’d better check and re-check that the venue understood the  technical specs before loading in and rigging up. \n\nConversely, if they got a phone call in advance asking if they REALLY needed a football helmet full of cream cheese, or whatever other stupid stuff they’d stipulated, it showed that the promoter was paying attention, then they could have an informed conversation about how many amps of electricity the PA would need, and so on.\n\nDave Lee Roth, a born raconteur, has of course told this story a thousand times.

Even a non musician would recognize that with six spaces, unless some symbol or multi letter rebus is involved, it has to be  __SHARP. The beauty of this clue is that the key of B major has 5 sharps to choose from. (To be honest, I didn’t know this off the top of my head like many of our readers I’m sure do. But I took piano lessons and I know how to play that scale, so I just did it in my head.) The options are F  C G  D  A (remember Fast Cars Go Dangerously Around Every Bend).  For this same answer the constructor could have made it easier by cluing E Major(4 sharps) or harder (F# with 6 or C# with 7).  FWIW, DSHARP has only been clued to a major key twice before, both times in 2017, once to the key of B Major and once to \nE Major. For completeness, when B Major has appeared in the clue ( like today) , twice the answer was DSHARP and 4 times ASHARP.

For the record, I liked it, I thought it was well constructed and a fun challenge. But here’s a recipe for disaster: 1) rebuses (divisive on their own) 2) needing specialized knowledge and reading the title which not everyone does 3) no clue where the rebuses would be and not symmetric (not that it would be possible for this complexity) 4) overall higher level of difficult clueing for a Sunday (and if you think no one is going to complain about having to know the name of an obscure discus champion guess again).  Just fair warning they will come, and this is certainly a harder than average Sunday for most. But again I really enjoyed it, thanks for stretching me.","createDate":"1715480912","updateDate":"1724030087","approveDate":"1715480914","recommendations":40,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133148526","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-12","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4361070394515991}

It's a rebus!!  Oh, goody!!  Pure EUPHORIA (which doesn't fit. btw.)\n\nBut I'm flying blind because I don't know zilch about a \"Pixar Box\".  Is it some sort of video game?  (No, I'm not being coy; those were actually my thoughts upon opening up the puzzle.)\n\nAnyway, what are my rebuses so far?  CARS.  UP.  LUCA.  WALL-E (That was a film I remember because I saw it.)  SOUL.  COCO.  Aha!!!  WAIT FOR IT!!!  Four I recognize as films, so they must all be films!  Pixar films!  Not so hard, after all.\n\nWell, hard enough that I needed a few cheats and semi-cheats to finish.  I looked up LALALA and BANA.  I typed in CABO SAN and CABO SAN LUCAS came in -- giving me the LUCA rebus.\n\nI did want COCOA instead of HOT COCOA (didn't you?) at 100D.  This was the trickiest clue in the puzzle.  But I knew that the U.S. Congress is known as the HILL and that therefore 100D had to begin with an \"H\".\n\nMissed one.  Darn!  I had written in A NEW WORLD/A HEART before I knew the trick. I never thought to go back and clean that up.  If I had, I'm sure I would have seen BRAVE NEW WORLD/BRAVEHEART.\n\nBut I didn't.  A double DNF (the cheating and the wrong answer) on a very clever rebus puzzle -- and one that was a lot fairer and more accessible than I expected it to be at the outset.","createDate":"1715532134","updateDate":"1715628426","approveDate":"1715532137","recommendations":11,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133157322","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8492007255554199}
