My husband still prefers the sweet stuff but like you, I've moved a whole different direction.)\n\nAnyhow, our cruise just had to cancel our visit to Turks and Caicos, which was the whole reason we chose this particular cruise. Super bummed because we've wanted to check it out for ages. We'll still have fun, perhaps even running AMOK, but still bummed at moment. \n\nSoooooo, with extra down time, can anyone recommend a super fun archive puzzle that sticks out to you for me to try?
