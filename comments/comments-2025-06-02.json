I also like the opposite-meaning-in-opposite-corners MEH and YUM.  \n\nPuzzle-inspired riddle:  The U.S. has a trio of four-letter states, the lowest number of letters.  But it also has a trio of 13-letter states, the highest number.  What are they?  (Answer in reply.)\n\nSo, here’s the OREO story, thanks to MIT.  Eight out of ten times, when you twist the cookie apart, the creme center will remain on one side.  Why?  Because when the cookie is made, the creme is dabbed onto one side, and soon after, the other side is affixed.  Due to the creme being on the first side longer than the second, it adheres harder to the first side.  You’re welcome.\n\nThis puzzle had spark; it was way more YUM than MEH.

We say someone is going to con-VERT to a new religion (verb), but he's a CON-vert (noun).  This is quite consistent over dozens of words.\n\nMost of the time, context is the only clue.  Wind is one example.  With the short I, it's the atmospheric phenomenon; with the long I, it's what we do to (an old-fashioned) watch.  There's no good way to orthographically represent either sound differently, so either one works.  But again, one's a noun, and one's a verb, so context clarifies.  \n\nThis leads to the opportunity to create some crossword misdirection.  On Nov. 28 of last year, [Winds] leads to SPOOLS; there's no way to know which \"wind\" is being used.  On Sept. 17, 2021, [Wind on the water?] leads to REEL, which is a fishing reference, but the context makes you think it's the other \"wind\".\n\nStill, out of hundreds of clues, only a few are ambiguous, and that's intentional.

Sometimes we just sit and admire the verbal wallpaper the others are creating---it's almost performative. My role at that point was to inject amused inconsequentialities until the topic shifted.
