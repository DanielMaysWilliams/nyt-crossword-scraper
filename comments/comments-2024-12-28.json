Between 1973 - 2006 South Carolina required “mini-bottles” , usually 1.75ozs. with no free pouring, but that was repealed as the drinks were pretty strong.To my knowledge, the only State that has legislated a shot size is Utah, at 1.5 ounces, which is measured using the “Berg” system. In the constructor’s Australia, a standard drink is a “nip” ( a word which will not likely be seen in the xwords again) which is defined as 30 ml, or closer to one ounce.
