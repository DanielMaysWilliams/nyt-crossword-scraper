My co-worker was a passionate hater of disco, and found Saturday Night Fever especially irksome. The frequency with which students played STAYINALIVE on the jukebox eventually drove him to madness.  After four consecutive plays, he saw someone headed to the box for what he assumed was a fifth play, so he popped out from behind the counter, strode purposefully to the jukebox, yanked the plug out and announced that the jukebox was out of service. He stood there glaring and holding the plug daring anyone to contradict him.  The room fell into a stunned silence.  Satisfied, he returned to his place behind the counter and we finished out the lunch shift without further incident.

No flies on those Bronte girls.  The real question is, could either Catherine Earnshaw or Isabella Linton be called bridezillas? Of the two, Catherine is the more socially ambitious and weirdly misguided, making more confounding decisions, like marrying Linton, so I guess she's got more zilla in her, although Isabella had an anger streak early on that went away with her shouldering more responsibilities. \n\nLoved Truth Bomb & So Not True.

The bride is to be the center of attention, not the both of them. She buys a four-figure (or even five) gown, and dictates what her bridesmaids must wear; he and his groomsmen rent tuxes from Men’s Wearhouse. She boxes it up and keeps it forever; he sends them back with a chosen groomsman on Monday. \n\nIf the groom is lucky, he gets to pick the style of tuxedo. The bride (and maybe her mother) picks everything else. Flowers, pictures, music, menu. \n\nNow the vast majority of young women handle this with grace and aplomb. But enough do not that it has become a stereotype. \n\nThe number of men acting this way is infinitesimal because he never was the center of attention in the first place. \n\nAll this, of course, presumes one bride and one groom.

I'm a LOTR fan and having two related clues made my day (acknowledging that this might have been annoying to others). \n\nAlthough I believe that crossing of proper names is going to happen and should happen, I agree that the crossing of obscure names should be discouraged. I am not going to say that I should be the arbiter of what is \"obscure\", but I imagine there are algorithms that can be used to determine this based on relatively objective parameters. \n\nPuzzles should challenge us and I enjoy learning about people, places and things I'd never heard of from crossword references.
