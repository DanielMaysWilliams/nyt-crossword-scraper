I thought people who don't get that would be interested in this week's Q & A.\n\nHow constructors handle archaic and obscure entries\nBy Christina Iverson\n\n“Often I find that the puzzle ends in an exceptionally challenging area with more than a few words that are either a real stretch, rarely used or archaic. I wonder if the puzzle maker struggled with that particular area when the puzzle was under construction, and that same area is where they ended. Do you think this is true?” — Anonymous\n\nFrom Christina:\n\nWhen constructors start making a puzzle, they generally start with a “grid skeleton,” which is just the black squares placed strategically around the theme entries. With a solid skeleton, there are nearly endless possibilities for what words you can use to fill the rest of the grid. The constructor will typically try to start filling the grid in the most constrained area — long entries that cross several theme entries, perhaps, or an unusual pattern like a five-letter entry that ends in V.\n\nFor a themeless puzzle, the grid skeleton may or may not have certain entries locked in. Some constructors start with one or more “seed entries,” which are words or phrases that they’d like to build a puzzle around. Other themeless constructors start with a particular grid design that they find appealing, without any entries locked in place.","createDate":"1766200077","updateDate":"1766261131","approveDate":"1766200080","recommendations":11,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147438534","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8427591323852539}

I know he's not exactly obscure, but it's been a long quite a while since I thought about him. I've had bouts of caring about tennis in my life and that was one of them. \n\nI'm not saying that I'm all hoity toity or anything, but it's just nice to know sometimes that I still got it!  🤣 \n\nDon't worry, I'm not getting a big head. I should have gotten BEETS faster because I recently did an impact report on our sugar beets research program for work.\n\nSo something I knew about some 35 years ago or so popped out way faster than something I knew about this very year. But that's just how bingo ball cage brains work! 🤷‍♀️\n\nWhat I haven't followed in a very, very, very long time, like since the 1980s Brewers, is baseball. I only knew the answer to 50A because of this crossword comment community. Immediately thought of of SBK and others out here with sadness for you.

I think the best you can say from their data is that for “advanced solvers” (or whatever terminology you prefer) it was much easier than normal for a Saturday puzzle. For the true median solver, it still was likely a faster solve, but maybe by a smaller % amount. There were definitely more places than usual where I was not confident about the spelling (e.g. GENEVE, KREWES, KEENEN) which I could see causing delays for many.  Without the data though, it’s just a hunch based on feels. \n\nNYT has the data for all app and online solvers. It would be nice if they published that data like they do for other NYT Games.\n\nThat said, for me personally (an intermediate solver IMHO), I solved this puzzle in just 37% of my average Saturday solve time (63% faster than average).","createDate":"1766257007","updateDate":"1766308627","approveDate":"1766257008","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147442184,"parentUserDisplayName":"George","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147451648","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4941839873790741}
