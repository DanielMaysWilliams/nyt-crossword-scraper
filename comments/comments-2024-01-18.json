While I don't recall any concern about our capacity to grok the \"I before E\" rules and its various caveats, the school board seemed very concerned that any of us might flee the state at some point and spread misinformation regarding the spelling of our fair city (Bugs Bunny had the pronunciation covered ... well enough anyway).\n\nLet's face it, is a nutso-looking series of letters. Worse, it doesn't match the spelling of its eponym, Francisco de la Cueva, AKA The Duke of Albu*r*querque. Where'd that \"r\" go anyway? None who made serious inquiries in that vein lived long enough to report back with their findings, so we may never know.\n\nSo this is how they learned us: every so often, we'd stand up and intone: AL..... BYOOOO ...... QUARE....... KWEEEE. Over and over again. Kind of screwed up our pronunciation for a while, but once we nailed the spelling, peer pressure and idle threats from adult authority figures set us straight.\n\nAnd the school board was right to be paranoid. My dad got a job in Maryland two years later and we made east whereupon my lifelong mission began to spread the good word, or spelling as it were, to folks who habitually mispronounced my last name and didn't believe me that New Mexico is a state of the United American variety. I have been asked to show my green card more times than is remotely reasonable.\n\nFun puzzle.","createDate":"1705574729","updateDate":"1705683602","approveDate":"1705574731","recommendations":19,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130530029","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6748880743980408}

Moreover, crossing that name with two other words that require specific knowledge (1D in the clue, 3D in the fill) which, themselves, are crossed with another proper name (20A) and a foreign-language term (1A)... that's a bit of a mess.\n\nThen, again in the SE, one of the rebus squares is in a proper name (51D) which has, as it's immediate neighbor, a foreign language term (50D). Not knowing either of those would leave a sizeable hole in that corner. \n\nMy feeling is that a good rebus puzzle lets the rebus be the star attraction, which I didn't find to be the case today.

I don't wish to play another hidden game at the same time. When I am playing tennis, if you offer me a chance to play chess at the same time, it's not more fun. It's annoying and distracting. \nNow, in my view, some gimmicks such as a clever Sunday idea can be quite fun. The difference is that they offer some kind of logic as to why they exist. Put another way, a joke has to have two meanings, not one. A good Sunday puzzle has three, a third way of combining what is said. \nA rebus like this is just a hassle.

Or you can use the rebus key (depending on what phone you use, it may be on the second keyboard, accessed by the \"more\" or \"...\" key).  That will allow you to use multiple letters.  If there are two-way answers, like today, it's best to separate the two parts with a slash mark (but only if you want to fill in everything; as I said, just one first letter will always suffice).\n\nThe article lists all the possibilities that will be accepted this time.  There's also a link to a more general article on rebuses.\n\nI'm guessing you're fairly new to these puzzles, so I suggest you give rebuses a chance.  Newcomers can be overwhelmed by them at first, but you get used to them and might even look forward to them some day.\n\nAs to why they're called rebuses, originally (pre-electronic), you could put your own representations of words in a rebus box.  For example, it might be easier on paper to just draw a star than to enter the letters STAR.  People who solve online usually can't do that, or even if they could, find it easier to just write out the word.\n\nGood luck and I hope you eventually warm to rebus puzzles, because most of us experienced folk really like them.","createDate":"1705592207","updateDate":"1705613633","approveDate":"1705592210","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130536312,"parentUserDisplayName":"jennie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130536633","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7235294580459595}
