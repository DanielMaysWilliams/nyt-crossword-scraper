Didn't realize/remember till after the solve that the Lewis was \"our\" Lewis. A delicious, sly, very \"al dente\"-and-crunchy (as Saturdays were meant to be) puzzle, with great clues that‚Äî along with the crosses‚Äî allowed the real answer to come into focus slowly like a very gradually unblurring movie shot. There were times I caught on to the basic 2nd meaning of a clue but not quite the 3rd one! For 58A I figured 'stuck' didn't mean 'mired', I figured it was vaxed though: D'you display your band-aid? Your vax card? Crosses allowed the true answer to come into view. With SALT I assumed it was sumthin sumthin \"accord\" or \"treaty\" (except isn't the \"T\" for treaty? [*google* Ah, nawp, it's 'Talks'!]), until finally the top half came into view and I got PACT too. Had UPCS at 28A instead of URLS, figured 26A meant either a catchy tune or impatience, 16A POOH was another \"Aha!\" which, from the clue, I thought I wouldn't know (till I did)‚Äî just as a great Saturday puzzle is s'posed to do! Thankfully I guessed 17A TITOPUENTE right away, not knowing if I was right, immediately got 18A ALMA (since 'Gustav' doesn't fit & I didn't think he had any nickname like 'Stav' or whatnot); too many other \"Aha\" \"Oho\" fills to mention.\n\nTom Lehrer has everything you might wanna know about Alma Mahler in his song \"Alma\", one of my favs. I've played it in Ballet class, a very spritely, lilting 3/4:\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QL6KgbrGSKQ?si=84Ea5geL7h3zSLzp\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/QL6KgbrGSKQ?si=84Ea5geL7h3zSLzp</a>\n\nThanks, Lewis and Barbara!","createDate":"1734853349","updateDate":"1734865920","approveDate":"1734853353","recommendations":2,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138466106","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8170482516288757}
