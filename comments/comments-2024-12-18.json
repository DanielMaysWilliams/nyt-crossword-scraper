The other weekdays follow the pattern, but Saturday is Sábado, or Sabbath.  \n\nIn Greek, Sunday is Κυριακή (Kiriakí)(Lord's day), and Monday is Δευτέρα (Deftéra) (also second day).  Pattern continues, then Saturday is Σάββατο (Sávato), also Sabbath.\n\nIn Hebrew, Sunday is yom rishon. יום ראשון (first day), Monday yom sheni. יום שני (second day) and so on, but Saturday is שבת (Shabbat). \n\nAll the above derive from the seventh day being the Sabbath, which was Saturday.  Regardless, Russian is different, and don't even ask about Persian, which starts its week on Saturday, but the numerical names of the days derive from how many days after Saturday it is.\n\nAmerican calendars probably start the week on Sundays because they always have.

As others have explained it's just used to mean movie lover / studier / voracious consumer.  (But apparently originally meant moviemaker.)  Highfalutin and sometimes applied mockingly, but it comes up in print reviews and such.  (Gourmand is probably a close analog.)  I probably wouldn't use it.\n\nI kind of don't understand being perplexed about it.  We've borrowed, you know, a word or two from other languages.  Maybe three.  ;)\n\nAs to its \"suffix\" part, uh, so?  The stated  request was \"any other word ending in -aste\".  No need to lambaste.  :)\n\nInteresting, MW lists 34 words ending in aste (7 \"common\") and 362 ending in ast.  Neat tool I didn't know they had; it must come in very handy for word game developers.\n\n____________________\nJesse Goldberg 8/28/2024 for Puzzle of the Decade\n(emu filler)","createDate":"1734549551","updateDate":"1734551031","approveDate":"1734549554","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138382947,"parentUserDisplayName":"Grant","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138384913","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6720973253250122}
