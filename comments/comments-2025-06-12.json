I wanted triple first (I spelled HAM with a single M at first, so my first Down themed entry only had three sets of double letters), but that did not fit. Then some crosses indicated it would be QUADRUPLE. Oh! The football (soccer, to you) player is spelled HAMM!\n\nThen it was just a matter of filling the rest of grid. It was not easy. I recalled some stuff I have seen here before, like ULTA and STP. Some entries I got from crosses only, like the name of the basketball player. Had A TASTE slowed me down, especially as I was confused by the clue for WILLOW. I instantly thought of willow for \"weeping\", but giant? Weeping willows are symbols of Mazowsze (Mazovia), the region of Poland where I've lived all my life, but I would never call the giants.

My eye really just ran across headline, but I didn’t actually read the article since the only sport I follow at all is baseball…nonetheless, it was on my radar (SONAR?). One of the first things I do in a puzzle on Thursdays and Sundays is look for long(ish) fills in the south, since that’s often where the revealer is. When I saw the clue for 50A, the answer came to me immediately…and I finished, if not at a PB, pretty close to one.\n\nAlso, I appreciated some of the clueing…”Article around a photo?” “She-eep.” …and the juxtaposition of OVERTHROW beside P(EE)W(EE) F(OO)BA(LL).\n\nGiven our current time, I could only see SALEM/SELMA as places that, in addition to being anagrams, were also the locations of some of the most shameful events in our history.","createDate":"1749734831","updateDate":"1749798242","approveDate":"1749734831","recommendations":19,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142797807","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8366975784301758}

Body\nI'm not one that got mad.  I suspected rebuses, and checked one horizontal answer.  Once confirming this, the rest of the rebuses (is that the plural?) occurred to me easily.  Of course, Thursdays usually need cheating, and I needed my average of ten.  I only get 'mad' if I need more than my usual amount of cheats.  \n\nI greatly admire the cleverness (and hard work) it took to create this puzzle.","createDate":"1749697103","updateDate":"1749757040","approveDate":"1749697104","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142791801,"parentUserDisplayName":"N.E.

Nothing in the puzzle requires any deep sports knowledge. It just requires paying attention to what's going on in the world around you as it unfolds. You couldn't avoid hearing about the champion national teams as they were on their run. Names like Megan Rapinoe, Brandi Chastain and others were in the news and being interviewed on TV constantly. OLAJUWON was a top player for years, and his existence percolated into the consciousness of many non-fans over a decade or more of dominance. (His name is hard to spell, but the crosses were all easy.)\n\nAwareness issue, that's all. And perhaps attitude.  Some people complain about themes of things they don't care for.

That happened to me almost four years ago. It broke my streak because I didn’t notice it until a few days later when I went to show my husband the clever Thursday puzzle I had figured out. All of a sudden the time was ticking and I was so confused. I literally deleted a letter and re-entered it. Got a blue star even though I had the gold three days earlier. A few months later it happened to someone else in the comments and one of the veteran solvers suggested they contact tech support to restore their streak. It worked for them, but alas it was too late for me to go back and restore mine. So I’m now 25 days away from my four year streak!","createDate":"1749754710","updateDate":"1749761654","approveDate":"1749754720","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142805676,"parentUserDisplayName":"Carol","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142807486","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-12","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4495745897293091}

Wait until you find an another example where you think you need more than one letter.\n\nThen, once you've guessed there is a rebus there, check the cross to see if you can make sense of the cross with the multiple letters.\n\nIf you can, you've got good evidence for a rebus.\n\nBut note:  I doubt you'll ever see just one or two rebuses.  You'll find they form a pattern, and that pattern is often described in a revealer clue, related to the theme, which gives you meta clues.\n\nFor example, this one was easy for me, because I know Mia Hamm has two M's and Occam has two C's.   That was proof that something was going on.  Then I checked the down clue(s), seeing if the doubled letters made sense there.  If they do, you know you have rebuses, and if they don't you'll have to find more evidence.\n\nI think a lot of people just assume a rebus on Thursday.  There are other forms of trickery other than rebuses.  So don't just shove one in the first time you think it might be there.  Wait for another instance of the same problem.\n\nGiven that a lot of people comment on how their rebuses didn't work in a puzzle that doesn't have them, I suspect a lot of people try to force them.","createDate":"1749762927","updateDate":"1749810046","approveDate":"1749762928","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142809408,"parentUserDisplayName":"Chris","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142809652","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7827668786048889}
