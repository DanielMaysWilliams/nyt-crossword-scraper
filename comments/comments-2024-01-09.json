Follow the sun, words to live by, my personal Dao. And for Solomon following the sun was literally going North Up. Did you see the movie? It didn't get much attention, if I remember, due to off-camera controversies by the lead actor, but it was powerfully moving and beautifully shot. Loved Went Kaboom, Sat in the Fridge -- there was a lot of daring derring-do and playfulness in word choices and cluing. I Robot and Ibex. the cluing for for Chili Oil & Octopi, for Edison & Hound Dog. Magical.\n\nThe only shadow that crossed the sun for me was the earworm of the theme song from \"Happy Days\" as soon as it became clear the circles were days of the week. Not even Hound Dog or Norah can shake it out. I'm gonna have a gin fizz or two. I'm shouting OK OK! Take it off the juke!\n\nAnd also, I'm not quite comfortable, and I suspect Mr. Wagner isn't either, from his notes, with TUESDAY hinting phonetically at the circled letters. TWOs DAY just doesn't make as much sense as TWO DAYS, which might have better been clued to yield TODAY'S, as in \"Today's broadcast has been brought to you by...\" to yield the phonetic clue of two days. But maybe that was impossible. I just sense in Mr. Wagner's longish explanation a little ruefulness.\n\nI'm just so taken with this puzzle, its liveliness and unexpected turns.
