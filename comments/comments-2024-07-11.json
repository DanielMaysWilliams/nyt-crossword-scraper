Thursday puzzles are meant to be the tricky ones. Mondays are the easiest; Saturdays the hardest; Sundays the longest.\n\n2. On Thursdays, learn to think outside the box. You will have puzzles where you have to put more than one letter inside one square -- these are called rebuses. They are so much a part of crossword culture, that the NYT online version actually has a \"Rebus\" option right above the puzzle. you press that and then you can type in more than one letter into one square (sometimes as many as five or even more!). And this week we had a puzzle in which you had to stretch one letter across two squares. Looking above or below for the missing letter is par for the course.\n\n3. People who want straight-forward puzzles, with one letter per box and no tricks can buy a booklet of them at the checkout line at the grocery store for $0.99.

We have been suffering through construction of a “cross-town link”  for 13 years.  It was begun in 2011 with a projected completion date of 2020. It is 2024 and we are still waiting.  In fact, several months ago, the head of the project called a news conference to announce — TUM-DE-LE-UM — that he couldn’t tell us when it would be complete.  So for the time being, only the first word of the project is apt.\n\nRoad (re)construction in Toronto is so poorly planned and so badly executed, that we have gridlock at all hours of the day on major thoroughfares.

That’s a variation I don’t remember seeing before.  \n\nFurthermore, each of the bumps is directly centered over ROAD, that is, over the letters OA, which had to make the construction even tougher.\n\nThis is also a tight theme; I don’t think we’re going to see many alternative theme answers in the comments today.  It’s also original – there’s never been a bump-in-the-road theme in any of the major crossword venues.  In fact, BUMP IN THE ROAD is a debut answer not only in the Times, but in any of the major crossword venues.  \n\nSo, tight theme, lovely execution, and original.  But, most importantly, how was the solve?  I found it to be a lovely mix of footholds and resistance.  Satisfied my brain’s work ethic in some places, brought the delight of quick figure-outs in others.\n\nSo, a splendid outing, for which I’m grateful.
