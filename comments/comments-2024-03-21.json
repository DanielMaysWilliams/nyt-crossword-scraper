The two puzzle challenges don't even utilize the same side of the brain.  Mazes are right-brained activities that call for prowess at spatial relations, and rebuses are all about words and language -- a very left-brained activity. \n\nI went back to that date on the Rexblog and see that I didn't never wrote a comment.  That means I didn't do the puzzle and I probably didn't do the puzzle because I'm lousy at spatial relationships and didn't want to try to go through a maze.   Whereas, I'm a rebus-lover and I adored today's puzzle.\n\nTo compare the two puzzles is like comparing a corned beef sandwich to a Volkswagon.   THE TWO PUZZLES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER AND SHOULD NOT BE COMPARED!\n\nAs a constructor, I can tell you that it's hard enough to come up with a theme that's never been done before.  But then to have your puzzle unfavorably compared  to a puzzle that's entirely different in kind -- well that's the height of unfairness.  You have my sympathies, Joe Marquez.

Not for the same reason as Deb, but because I thought it could have been more difficult. \n\nThere are people who come here and whine whenever there's a rebus or a word they don't already know, or whatever. Often, they call the constructor \"lazy\" or \"stupid\" etc. Or they make nonsensical proclamations like \"rebuses are not crosswords\" thus displaying their own ignorance about what a crossword is. In most cases, these criticisms are obviously invalid and not well thought out. \n\nContrast that with what Deb did. She stated that she liked the puzzle, but thought it could have been better. She then compared it to a puzzle from about 13 years ago that she liked better and that she considered a similar mechanism or theme, and she explained why she thought today's puzzle fell short.\n\nDeb's criticisms are valid and well stated. I may not agree with them, but they are valid opinions stated respectfully and supported with a reasonable argument. \n\nI just wish that all those who chime in with \"that's not even a word!!!\" when the word in question is in most, if not all, dictionaries, or \"The constructor is lazy and incompetent if they use a rebus\" when just about all veteran solvers know that it is much more difficult to construct a rebus than a plan-vanilla puzzle. \n\nI could go on.

What is fair game in terms of criticism? Should we follow the kindergarten rule of only speaking up if we have something nice to say? Or does uniform happy talk end up making these comments some sort of mandatory feel-good session for constructors? Does nothing but praise appropriately elevate the constructor or does it devalue the genuinely brilliant puzzles that we are sometimes graced by? \n\nIn my view, @Deb, you provided a textbook example of how to express the reality that not every puzzle is the best crossword ever to be constructed. You didn’t denigrate the constructor, you explained where the puzzle fell just a bit short in your view (in a way that was persuasive to me, at least), and you highlighted the work of other constructors. Best of all you recognized that you were describing your own views, not some sort of objective Truth, and you acknowledged that others might feel differently: YMMV. \n\nHere’s hoping that your model inspires commenters: that it both gives permission to say that not every puzzle is God’s gift to Crosslandia, and provides instruction in how to express those thoughts gracefully and without attacking the constructor.","createDate":"1711134428","updateDate":"1711207225","approveDate":"1711134431","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132033572","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6024129390716553}

Those are different things.  Secondly, that one was a Sunday, which means there was more room to carry out an elaborate theme.\n\nAnd most importantly, even the most clever of concepts cannot be duplicated at will.

If I saw an obviously substandard show, I would give some constructive criticism but play up what positive aspects I could find. But sometimes with a really good play I might say something like this was great but I wish it had x and it would have been a masterpiece… It’s all about context, and I really feel in this case Deb was really just musing on how it could be better, and maybe even musing about how as we get more experience with puzzles we get jaded and expecting more and more. I don’t think the creator should feel disappointed about this review honestly.","createDate":"1711066240","updateDate":"1711070559","approveDate":"1711066242","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132020273,"parentUserDisplayName":"Becca","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132021201","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5161451101303101}

The point is that while this was a perfectly well constructed and enjoyable puzzle, that the idea of an “escape room” might have been given a more interactive or engaging treatment than just a straightforward rebus, and she gave an example of that. That’s all. I’m a contributor, and have had plenty of rebus puzzles rejected because a basic rebus puzzle isn’t necessarily so interesting anymore. I think this one is elevated a bit more because the construction and fill are excellent and I think it still posed a fair challenge for a Thursday. So that’s just the point she was making and construing it as a negative attack on the puzzle overall or the constructor is just wrong.","createDate":"1711038659","updateDate":"1711091903","approveDate":"1711038660","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132009368,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132010713","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.571003258228302}
