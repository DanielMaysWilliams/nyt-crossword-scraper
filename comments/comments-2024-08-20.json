Polish people never much liked the Soviets, but their \"culture,\" \"achievements\" and products were force-fed to us for decades. I learned CCCP from decals on model airplanes a battery-operated lunar lander (my parents were both historians, and they always took care to comment truthfully on the Soviet-aligned propaganda, e.g. my mom told me about the American role in the space race when I got that Soviet lander in the 80s).\n\nI am slightly surprised some solvers thought the answer would be USSR - that would be the equivalent of American rockets being labeled with the Russian США. TAJIK and TAIGA were gimmes, too.\n\nThe cultural differences between me and American solvers are just fascinating - we struggle with such different things! I have no idea who Charlie Brown is (or who his friends are), I have never heard of a MOOD ring, I only vaguely know March Madness from these puzzles (and as a result its winners are a huge enigma to me), and as for sports coaches...

I solved it as a themeless -- especially since there were plenty of other things to think about other than trying to find a common thread.  I wonder if I would have picked up on the homophones if I'd gone looking for a theme.\n\nSo they call them CUBE FARMS now.  They were merely cubicles in my day and we hated them.  Of course people didn't work much of the week from home the way people do today; if you were in a cubicle, you were really IN it.  I always felt that office productivity could easily be tripled just by putting everyone in an office with a door that could be closed.  Rant over.\n\nFor \"tissue sample test\" I wanted something like PERSON WITH A BAD COLD BLOWING HIS NOSE AND SNEEZING.  I never thought of that kind of tissue.  Can you imagine?\n\nSuch a good puzzle. Sam -- but why do you have five (5!!!) pop music clues?  Why would you cross two of them, OASIS and ALA when both entries can be clued in a zillion ways without using a musical reference?  Yes, it's a musical-themed puzzle, I get it, but there are only so many pop music trivia clues I want to see in a puzzle.\n\nWhen USSR doesn't work, I doubt there's anyone under the age of 65 who will get CCCP without all the crosses.  Bur once I saw that USSR wouldn't work, CCCP came back to me in a rush.\n\nAn excellent Tuesday that would have been even better with less trivia.","createDate":"1724166106","updateDate":"1724256824","approveDate":"1724166109","recommendations":11,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135585793","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.787991464138031}

Also, she mentioned that with 42A a “cardinal rule of crossword construction is to not include any entry word in clues”.
