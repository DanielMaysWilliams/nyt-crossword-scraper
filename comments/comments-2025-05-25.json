But I did get it done before going back to really take in what was happening.\n\nAnd then it occurred to me:  The WORMHOLEs work on both the across and the down answers!  There was a previous WORMHOLE puzzle, on Thurs., July 18, 2004, but there were no rebus squares and it only worked once per clue.  (The continuations started with an unchecked square, so there was no crossing of two answers at the WORMHOLE square.)

I think we will see some of that.\n\nOf course, there will be veteran solvers for whom this puzzle is not to their taste, and some newbies who don't blame the puzzle for their inability to solve it.  But nevertheless, the trend will be more praise on Sat. night, more criticism on Sunday.\n\nI think that if veteran solvers can finish a puzzle and praise it, but others get stuck and frustrated, the constructor has created a great puzzle.  If no one can solve it, or everyone can, not so much.

I loved this puzzle. Thank you, Dylan, for this wild ride through space and time. There was a regular Wordplay commenter (don't remember their handle, but i'm sure some of you do) who used to encourage us to take a moment to look at the grid before we dive in. I've been so grateful for that advice, and today it served me well: i noticed six circles in colored pairs. When the wormhole theme dawned about halfway through, it was a quick jump back to those pairs. (With help from past Star Trek viewings, as i'm no astrophysicist.)\n\nThe construction was genius. As another poster said, solving took us all over the grid. And it took us all through the culture, from Frank CAPRA to OUTKAST, from RICE-A-RONI to TREACLE. Speaking of treacle, did anyone else notice a fair bit of British English here? It was like a lovely wormhole across the pond.\n\nLast, thank you too, Caitlin, for the tip that the three wormhole terms are kinds of worm!

(Can we please not call names?)  This puzzIe was just not my jam.   I prefer wordplay in the form of puns or riffs on famous quotations or themes related to history or pop culture.

It's uttered with a weary headshake.\n\nSo (in the usage I'm familiar with, and have uttered myself) it means \"I actually completely understand the cleverness here, but I think it hasn't been thought through properly.\"\n\nSo its meaning, in my experience, is almost the reverse of the one you invoke here.

I absolutely think the intent of those using the phrase here is to suggest what you say, as though somehow the puzzle was overdone, but given the context in which it's so often uttered, to me it instead shouts \"there was a hard trick here and I didn't cotton to it, so I'll complain that the fault was with the puzzle.\" It reminds me of someone coming to a cocktail party dressed in jeans and a t-shirt accusing the other guests of being overdressed - the difficulty never with the complainer, only with that which they complain about. \n\nAlas.
