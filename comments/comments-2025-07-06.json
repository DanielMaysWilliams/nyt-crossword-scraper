A bit harsh there...I know plenty of witches with faces smooth as porcelain and have rattled a multitude of gourds with flawless surfaces. Perhaps SOME witches and gourds are warty, but who is to say they all are, or that they do not have wens, cysts, moles, or simply growths, some benign, some malignant, and let us not forget tumors, nodules, beauty marks, boils, blisters, and excrescences? During the Black Death, the bubonic plague caused buboes or carbuncles, typically appearing on the groin, armpits, or neck and face, sometimes growing quite large. In advanced stages of the infection, the buboes might rupture and begin to ooze, and Bocaccio says they were quite painful. \n\nRegarding crones and hags, I cannot comment; but on the whole, enchantresses and sorceresses are clear-complected. Trust me on this. \n\nThe child of a friend of mind worked summers at an escape room in Durham NC. We were privy to stories of dates gone wrong (commonly, one person getting out early and going home, leaving her date stranded and still inside), of amor in the chambers (yuck), of freakouts on ketamine, and of the liberal use of the rooms as latrines.

Solved all the crossword clues in among the fastest times I’ve ever done, then was left with a non-crossword puzzle that was simultaneously dopey, uninteresting, and inscrutable. I can go elsewhere for riddles, this is the crossword, and while themes and games can be part of it they shouldn’t overtake the crossword element, which they did here.","createDate":"1751807290","updateDate":"1751859744","approveDate":"1751807291","recommendations":31,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143326512","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-06","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.793838620185852}

First, I thought this was REALLY fun. I enjoy spending my time on the puzzle, so I very much appreciate any extra layer that lets me crunch on it a little longer. Anyone else recall the lovely experience as a kid of having a parent or some other smart and loving adult lay out a treasure hunt for you? It feels... special. Like they took the time to *create* something for you to enjoy and be engaged with. That's what a carefully considered puzzle puts me in mind of. These constructors worked together to put something fun out in the world for us to enjoy. \n\nNow, can they be sure that *everyone* is going to enjoy it? Obviously not, and I enjoy the different viewpoints on the puzzle - to the extent that they reflect personal opinions. Folks who don't care for the escape room experience, people who don't enjoy riddles, etc etc - that all makes sense to me. \n\nWhat'll never make sense to me and what I'll not soon stop commenting on is the folks who paint the puzzle or (especially) people involved with a broad and imperious negative brush. \"Shame on Will Shortz\"? Seriously? *Shame*? \"Incomprehensible and irrelevant\"?

We rejected multiple other potential theme answers because they had at least one \"C\" in them, and we had used up our single C already...\n2. When filling the grid, Kevin deleted all the words containing C from our wordlist, and we narrowed down options for 12D to be words that ended in E, I, or T. This put more stress on the grid and fill for sure, but hopefully not in a way that was too obvious! We went through at least five completed grids before landing on this one.\n\nI was really committed to the single C in the puzzle, because I knew how much I would enjoy that aha moment as a solver, so I'm so, so pleased by this! (Sorry to your cat, though. We have a cat too, and she hates being startled.)\n\nP.S. My one regret from this puzzle -- I originally clued TIM TAM as [Popular chocolate biscuit from Down Under that can be used as a straw].
