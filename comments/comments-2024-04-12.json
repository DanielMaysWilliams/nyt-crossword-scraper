I informed him of these facts (har!) he said they always had potato salad (the mayo based one). I was like, noooo, potato salad is for the 4th of July!

And of course, like you say, there are ways to compensate for personal zeitgeist holes when solving.\n\n\"[M]any many decades of Thanksgiving meals\" suggests to me that I am probably younger than Sunshine. I would assume that using the word \"DISS\" and LIP-piercing are probably not too common in older generations.\n\nFWIW, corn on the COB at Thanksgiving isn't something I've ever encountered in the wild either (in probably fewer but still plural decades), but it sounds like others have. And I got my lip pierced (some 25 years ago) for reasons I don't think are *too* unfathomable - it was a visual identifier of my cultural in-group (somewhere between punk and goth), and aesthetically I felt it provided balance to my face due to a prominent mole opposite.
