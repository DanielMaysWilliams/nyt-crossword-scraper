The card(s) must be shown (melded) for all to see in order for the points (or, in rummy, rights) to be earned by the melder.\n\nIn each game there are different melds. Pinochle takes its name from the meld of the scandalous pairing of the Jack of Diamonds with the Queen of Spades (two one-eyed adulterers: binocular). In Cribbage, the point for the Jack of the turned-up suit (his nobs) along with all other points counted at the end of play are only pegged when the hand is laid out for all to see.\n\nRummy is of a different sort, but a melding game nonetheless. When the melds are laid out in front of a player, the player earns the right to unload cards on other melds. A player who hasn’t melded sits with a fistful of cards and is prevented from laying off certain cards. Gin rummy depends on a coup where only one hand is melded, sticking the others with their point totals all at once.\n\nOn a related note: I didn’t enjoy playing War as a child, because it made me car-sick even when played on the living room floor.","createDate":"1735656966","updateDate":"1735713808","approveDate":"1735658986","recommendations":14,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138645626","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5411080718040466}

That answers a lot of my questions about Will Shortz's recovery. I'd still lobby for Joel Fagliano to write a piece on his experience and for Shortz to do a guest column on WP about what it was like to work on puzzles this past year (the Everdeen Mason article said that Shortz still directed the Xword tournament this year, started picking puzzles for the NYT in May -- something I hadn't known -- and got back to creating puzzles for NPR's weekend edition in March). \n\nIt appears that Shortz's two strokes affected mainly mobility, which must have been a great relief to him, since many strokes affect language centers in the brain. I'm sure it was a worry for all who knew him or enjoyed the benefits of his wordmeistership that the strokes might have diminished his super-logo-powers. Him being back as editor of the crossword answers those concerns, obviously, but there may be more to say about that. \n\nAnd a valedictory address from Joel Fagliano would be very welcome indeed!\n\nHave a great new year!","createDate":"1735649736","updateDate":"1735713575","approveDate":"1735649740","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138639902,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138642833","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-31","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7629343867301941}
