It's the highest-scoring play in the sport, good for six points, with an opportunity to kick an extra point or run a play for two points.  (In most situations, teams opt for the single point because it's a near certainty.)\n\nA PUNT is a play in which the team on offense concedes possession to the defense by kicking them the ball.  This usually happens on fourth down, which is the last of four chances to gain ten yards.  At the beginning of each play, the down and distance needed for the next first down is given in the format of these examples:  1st and 10 (normal starting situation), 2nd and 5 (after one play that gains five yards), 3rd and 2 (after a second play that gains another three yards), 4th and 2 (after a third play with no gain). Upon reaching fourth down, the offense can run another offensive play, but if they don't pick up the required yardage, the other team gets the ball at that spot.  Usually, the offense will choose to PUNT the ball downfield, especially if the distance to go is long (\"4th and long\"); the opposition still will gain possession, but this time much farther down the field.","createDate":"1753062451","updateDate":"1753140003","approveDate":"1753062453","recommendations":9,"replyCount":19,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143675926","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8200725317001343}

The writing in it is mindbogglingly good: for what is actually quite a small game, the writers created a whole new world, with fascinating characters, a history, economy, and society, all described in some of the most intelligently sophiaticated and complex English I have ever heard or read. In fact, the English of Disco Elysium is so hard, a certain Polish gamers' community was reluctant to believe I was able to understand it - apparently I was the only one among them who could: all the rest played with the Polish translations enabled.\n\nNEWT I learned, obviously, from the local witch, who turned me into one. I got better though.","createDate":"1753074834","updateDate":"1753182635","approveDate":"1753074836","recommendations":32,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143677018","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9785899519920349}

While steelhead are derived from rainbow trout and share the same biologic name (Oncorynchus mykiss), they have adapted to the same life cycle as salmon, spawning in fresh water rivers of the Pacific and spending a year or two there before migrating as 6\" smolts to the ocean. Most spend two or three years feeding and growing to 6-8 pounds and then return to their natal river to repeat the cycle. Unlike Pacific salmon which die after spawning, around 15% can survive the spawn and then go back to the ocean for another cycle. Some even spawn 3-4 times, coming back progressively larger, which make them an attractive gamefish. Most anglers realize that these fish are \"too valuable to catch only once\" and so practice catch-and-release. Although hatchery steelhead are delicious, you should never buy wild steelhead as they are increasingly endangered. The four H's (lost Habitat, over-Harvest, Hydropower dams and Hatchery fish which compete with wild fish) have lead to declines in numbers. Farmed steelhead and salmon are also not as sustainable as some would lead you to believe, because of the immense damage the fish farms do to the estuaries and their inhabitants where the net pen farms are anchored.\n\nObviously I liked the puzzle! I would have had a PB Monday but I had NSA and SAABS which took me 4 minutes to sort out.

Within months it transformed into the most beautiful meadow, full of flowers, abuzz with bees. It warms our hearts to think how thousands of creatures are benefitting from it. Also, water retention has improved greatly - the old garden required regular watering. The new one needs no watering at all.

When I was part of a special services support group for parents of special ed kids, part of my role was talking to parents whose children had just been identified.

LD or JD? Stupid or learning disabled? Your MikeH probably had a sad back story and a school district that tossed him in a group setting with little or no one-to-one attention.

The student was mispronouncing \"enough\" and was sure that it didn't start with an E--a flimsy excuse to act out, but eventually he understood that everyday speech was often a bit casual.  (Explaining 'schwa' wasn't in the cards..)  \nEnglish orthography does have some extra challenges, with borrowed words, ancient words (think about know, kneel, etc., that have persisted in our language), and irregularities.  However, it's 85% phonetically regular.  \nPeople have different brains, and there are \"all kinds of minds,\" as a noted authority once titled a book.  Good spellers usually have good visual memory and perception.  My sister (with a PhD) often confuses the order of letters in speech and in writing (\"amino-centesis\" instead of \"amnio\"; Pashima instead of Pashmina, nickle for nickel, and puzzel for puzzle.)  It has little to do with intelligence, and people work out how to manage.  I taught 'strategies' like thinking \"Pract ICE\" or \"Re-CE-IVE\" for dealing with spelling that seemed to make no sense.  Sometimes it spills over into reading, like seeing 'hilarious' and thinking and saying 'hysterical.'
