I think it would have been more fun if I could have done it in one sitting like I normally do, but I did it in fits and spurts and then finished up tonight. I really enjoyed it the super cute theme. Some of them were quite funny! I also learned a new word, ONER.  It was the last square to complete and I was amazed that it was correct. \n\nNow for Monday's puzzle, fast, fun, chipper --just like Monday should be!

Selfish relatives who want things their way are even worse.  Most of the time, the groom (if there is one, of course; that's not guaranteed these days) is usually not heavily invested in the details.  \n\nMarriage can be based on romantic ideals, but at heart (pardon the pun), people in long-term cohabitating relationships should get married for legal protections, if for no other reasons.  The right to your spouse's pension, social security, assets, property, etc., and the right to be legally in charge in a medical emergency cannot be overstressed.\n\nThat said, our wedding was a moderately expensive affair 46 years ago, but not too lavish--typical, I guess, for the place and time.  My mother-in-law, who was just getting back on her feet after recovering financially from her own divorce, was happy to foot the bill.\n\nBut more importantly, my bride and I had established a relationship over several years that seemed solid enough to take the next step.  And the marriage has endured through nearly half a century as a result.\n\nWe're not perfect, but we make it work.  Some spouses finish the other's sentences; I finish her leftovers.

The same would hold true for many foods, especially chicken and ground meats.
