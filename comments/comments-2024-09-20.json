On Monday, we had a clue at 14A that absolutely blew up the comments section. I think it was completely predictable that this might happen. Yesterday, there was a three-letter entry at 53D which has been clued over 200 times, but never before to a current candidate running for office in a hotly contested race. The military record involved has been the subject of numerous recent news articles, and I think there was no reason to go there with the puzzle. The thread ultimately got deleted, including many benign observations.  I get it that not every potential source of controversy can be predicted by the editors, but IMHO these two certainly could have been.

Or, as is conveniently wiki-splained for us:\n\n\"The first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (Τὸ Ἕν, 'To Hen'), the source, or the Monad.[8] This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad emanated the demiurge or Nous (consciousness) from its \"indeterminate\" vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection.[9] This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the \"Demiurge\" or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the nonsentient force or dynamis, also called the one or the Monad. The DYAD is energeia emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called nous, Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. Plotinus also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in The Enneads[10] which more correctly is to express the concept of idealism or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the \"mind\" or nous (c.f. pantheism).\"\n\nSay wha?","createDate":"1726840131","updateDate":"1726880997","approveDate":"1726840135","recommendations":7,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136332971","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.41828659176826477}

So clever and fun!\n\nThose were favorites but the whole SHEBANG was fun and sparkly to me! And it taught me some things I did not know, whether I remember them or not is a whole other matter!
