I’m very used to the “flyer” spelling — for those who fly (“frequent flyer” > “frequent flier”) but *especially* for leaflets. I’m glad I’m not the only one, as both Merriam-Webster and Wikipedia agree that the mainline spelling for the synonym of leaflets is “flyer.”\n\n That said, I’ll readily admit I’m a complete wafer ignoramus (never had a NILLA in my life), and most people probably had zero issue with that particular square. \n\nFun puzzle!

Botting - using automated gameplay to defeat the challenges of a game - plagues sole multiplayer titles.\n\nMMORPGs - massively multiplayer roleplaying games - have economies. Players may trade in items, resources and services. Bots have been known to crash those economies, by \"farming\" what the game has to offer (repeatedly taking advantage of the game's systems by automated means). For example, a bot may gather in-game resources (ores, herbs, etc.) 24/7. A net of bots devalues those resources, flooding the market with them. Thus, the prices of services usually bought for those resources are subject to inflation.","createDate":"1761557946","updateDate":"1761571210","approveDate":"1761557947","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146218236,"parentUserDisplayName":"Chelsea","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146219033","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-27","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7489625811576843}
