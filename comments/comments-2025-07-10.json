I've been thinking about more of my reasons for that stance.\n\nSome Polish heroes were properly nasty people, in reality. As ugly facts about them emerge, they rarely lose their popular hero status. Thus, the ugliness in their lives becomes normalized. \"Hey, so and so did *this and that*, but he was a hero whose example we should all follow, so I can do *this and that*, too!\"\n\nAlso, the hero label may dehumanize a person. A mythical being can't be human, can they? Thus, can a hero enjoy the dignity all humans deserve? \n\nFinally, and this connects to my dislike for rites and rituals, I don't need to think of a person as a hero to value their achievements and any examples they may have set.

It initially signified a group of people sharing kinship and common ancestry, similar to a family or lineage. By the late 16th century, it began to be used more broadly to categorize people, including concepts like \"a race of saints\" or \"a race of bishops\". The term's application to human groups based on physical traits, and later its use to justify social hierarchies, developed more prominently in the 18th century, particularly during the era of colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade. “","createDate":"1752172545","updateDate":"1752175723","approveDate":"1752172547","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143443082,"parentUserDisplayName":"Byron","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143444795","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8781672120094299}
