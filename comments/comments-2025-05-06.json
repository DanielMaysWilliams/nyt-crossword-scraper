I managed to complete the puzzle without lookups but it was close... The theme didn't grab me, either - the fact the themed entries were contained in answers that had nothing to do with carnivals made the theme feel random.\n\nI did not like the clue for NOKIA. I used to publish papers on telecommunications law. \"Telecom\" is short for telecommunications, the transmission of signals over distances. A manufacturer of phones does not provide telecom services: it makes end devices, but it does not transmit signals over the network those devices are connected to. T-Mobile and Orange are European telecom giants, Samsung is not, and Nokia never was, either. Also, as far as I know, the NOKIA brand was bought by the Chinese and has been used for them for years now. Barry will say I knew the answer, anyway. Sure, but that does not mean the clue was good. \n\nI have fond memories of NOKIA the non-telecom. Poland had had cellphone services for a few years by the mid 90s, but they were offered by a state-owned monopoly, so the quality was low and prices high. In the mid 90s pro-competitive telecom market regulation was introduced. Two more mobile operators entered the market and soon cellphone services became affordable enough for regular people. I was among the first students at my high school to own a cellphone - a huge, heavy, black Nokia - ca. 1998. In fact, all my phones before the smartphone revolution were Nokias.

Here, APPA is a term of address for one’s father (regardless of the speaker’s gender, I believe). I don’t think 아 (‘a’) and 오 (‘o’) tend to vary between different romanization systems, either those used in scholarship or ad hoc in subtitling.\n\n(In the song “Gangnam Style,” omnipresent a decade ago, Psy uses “oppa” somewhat non-standardly to refer to himself in a quasi-first-person manner because his ironic playboy persona in the song is exhorting attractive young women to think of him as a young and virile [non-literal] older brother type, even though his age and appearance, as seen in the music video, would generally place him firmly in “ajusshi” [“uncle,” middle-aged man] territory.)","createDate":"1746555046","updateDate":"1746559602","approveDate":"1746555047","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141937873,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bobby","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141948049","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8479220271110535}

To me, telecommunication (2): \"technology that deals with telecommunication — usually used in plural\" still only has to do with telecommunication (1): \"communication at a distance.\" For example, technical solutions implemented via hardware (such as routers at network hubs) in the network to manage internet traffic is telecommunication (2). Phones are not: they are only the end devices - which are *not* part of the telecom network - that *people* use to communicate. This communication is enabled by telecom companies, which operate the networks that transmit signals over distances: the end devices connect to the network, but they are not literally part of telecommunication. In fact, distinguishing between the network and the end devices is at the core of the issue of network neutrality: under neutrality, the network operator - the telecom company - must allow the connection of any end device to the network, and the telecom operators should not discriminate against specific end devices.\n\nAlso, would you call Mercedes or Audi a transportation company? At least in Polish it is an absurd concept. They build cars, and these cars may become part of the transportation system (for example, when a city uses a Mercedes van to transport people with disabilities, as Warsaw does), but Mercedes or Audi are car makers, not transportation companies.

Rather than multiply by 9 and then divide by 5—which burns too many brain calories when you're doing numbers not divisible by 5—I multiply by 2, then subtract a tenth of that number, which is the same as x1.8 (plus 32), but super quick to do in your head without resorting to your phone. My biggest issue with getting used to Celsius is that remembering that 20C is 68F (i.e. needing my husband's bathrobe) and that 25C is 77F (\"A/c! Turn on the a/c!\") leaves several levels of comfort  to be decided in between, sometimes needing (horrors!) the decimal point or 3 significant figures.\n\nOK, all of this is a bit tongue in cheek, but it's still true that apparently I'm better at on-the-fly conversions that I am at adapting to a new system of measurement. My husband the engineer is fully switched to Celsius and all things metric; I continue having my weather app in Fahrenheit and my navigation in miles.

And I could see the mild panic in his eyes.
