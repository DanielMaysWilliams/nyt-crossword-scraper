I'm on the fence about \"The\" Mona Lisa; it's commonly referred to as simply Mona Lisa, from the Italian \"Monna Lisa\" (M'lady Lisa), and while Italians still refer to it as \"La Gioconda\" which would translate more to Mrs. Gioconda -- Lisa was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. On the other hand, it's such a bigtime painting, calling it \"The\" Mona Lisa conveys a sort of singularity to it, like \"The Ritz\" and \"The Empire State Building.\" \n\nHow do we know that it is a painting of Lisa del Giocondo and not Isabella of Aragon, or, as Freud speculated, only nominally of a Florentine noblewoman and that the enigmatic smile is a pentimento of Da Vinci's own mother, granting benign approval to Da Vinci's various projects as her eyes follow him around the room? Because a scholar discovered in a German library in 2005 in a 1477 edition of Cicero a marginal note from 1503 written by Agostino Vespucci, one of Da Vinci's acquaintances and admirers, who is reminded of Da Vinci by a passage in Cicero and ends his marginal comment by remarking that Da Vinci was working at the time on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo.

I almost broke my streak by accident.  Being in the U.S. Pacific time zone, three hours behind New York, I usually solve the night before the puzzle’s actual date. However, on Friday night, I realized that I had not solved Friday’s puzzle so I quickly dashed it out and finished at 8:45 PM Pacific time/11:45 PM New York time.  So I was a mere 15 minutes away from losing my streak which is now over seven years.   \n\nNow, I suppose I should put streak in quotes because I allow myself to do a little bit of research, such as looking at a map or the Wikipedia page for a movie, occasionally. I know that some feel that this doesn’t “count”. But it’s my streak and I’m always happy to complete the puzzle.  I learn more when I let myself do research but I like the challenge of avoiding it.  When I started solving, no amount of googling would have allowed me to finish a Friday or Saturday puzzle.  \n\nThis experience is a reminder to me not to borrow trouble.  The reason I forgot to do the Friday puzzle earlier is that I got anxious about the doctor’s appointment I had today which, thankfully, turned out to be no cause for concern.  Once again, I proved Mark Twain correct when he said, “I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.”  How many times must I re-learn this? \n\nThe puzzles continue to delight me.

Not knowing some names and expressions did not stop me. TOP BANANA I've never heard before, I think, but I love it 😀. TEENTSY - that just looks so weird! I realized it had to be something like that when I got some crosses there, but I was still surprised by what emerged, exactly. \n\nNice coincidence BTW - I only got TANTO because recently I've been playing the latest installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise: Shadows.

Maybe I don't get it for the same reason I've never found a religious element in my soul? For me being alive is good enough in itself. I get to love, to cry, to be bored, to do fascinating things, to help people, to hold grudges, to travel, to nap on my sofa, to eat and drink, to struggle with that strange feeling when you need to pee but just can't be bothered to get up so you just sit there thinking about it and it's becoming more of a problem but you keep sitting...\n\nIt's been quite the journey so far, and I just don't care where it's going (the grave, ultimately, anyway).

With Greece it's completely different - almost nothing survives there from the classical era, except for much of the Acropolis of Athens. Don't get me wrong, I felt special things when when I saw the ruins of Sparta or Argos bathed in the soft sunlight of early spring, with flowers blooming among the crumbling marble blocks, but to actually walk among the temples of Olympia and the treasuries of Delphi, to watch the Acropolis of Corinth from the deck of my ship... Wow, just wow. \n\nThe creators of the game took some liberties, obviously, like making the statue of Athena on the Athens Acropolis some 3 times larger than it was, building a grandiose version of the palace at Knossos and sculpting a gargantuan statue of Artemis on Delos, but 95% of what they did was true to history.
