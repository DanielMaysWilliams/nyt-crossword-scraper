In baseball, a fielder gets an assist for taking part in a play which results in an out, but not being the one who gets that out.  For example, a ground ball to an infielder that is fielded and thrown to the first baseman for an out; the first baseman gets the putout, the other infielder an assist.  The other infielder isn't being magnanimous here; only the first baseman is in position to make the putout.  That's why first basemen (and catchers, who get the putout on every strikeout) always lead the league in putouts.  An outfielder gets an assist by throwing a base runner out.  He's much too far away to make the putout himself.  \n\nOf course, in most other sports, like basketball, hockey and soccer, the player who gets an assist for making a pass is a team player because he or she doesn't try to score him/herself.  (The other player is usually in a better position to score.)\n\nSo the clue is fine, but I was a little stymied for a HOT MINUTE.","createDate":"1762832123","updateDate":"1762896761","approveDate":"1762832124","recommendations":8,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146566027","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8389065861701965}

Noticed that they used a 15 X 14 grid so the spanners would fit. Had to rely on crosses a lot to fill in the theme answers until it got to the point where they were recognized, and that's a good thing—I like being challenged (a little) and these weren't too difficult.\n\nI admit I got fooled by \"I so did not want to hear that\" and had TMI until it became obvious that it didn't work. EWW wasn't hard to come up with, as it and TMI were common comments when \"what happened in the ER\" was the topic. (As if THAT WAS MY FAULT!)\n\nI also mixed up the Pixar feature vs. Pixar short film, putting LUnA before LUCA, but I eventually got that corrected as well.\n\nI'm wondering if I'm going to have to turn on the heat tonight or tomorrow. Yesterday we had 80s (all temps °F), today the high was 60ish, and it's currently 49 in my breezeway, with the temp in the closest towns 42 and 43 and expected to hit the mid 30s overnight. I think the natives are trying to find their winter coats, while as a transplanted Wisconsinite, I might grab a wind-resistant jacket.

The sculpture is truly beautiful, exquisitely formed, small and delicate, dreamy and romantic. However, it is besieged by mindless hoards of tourist who arrive by bus and boat, snap a selfie for their Insta and are gone in less than a minute. The air vibrates with the ugly garbage-truck-like notes of diesel engines of dozens of gaudily painted tourist buses, their line at the curb of the narrow port street long like a freight train, waiting to gobble up the thoughtless barbarians. The mob jostles to get the best angle. Many never even look at the mermaid with their own eyes, only seeing her, tiny and insignificant, in the background of their phone screens, and all she ever sees of them are their backs. Art is reduced to a being a prop, the vase of flowers in a Victorian portrait, devoid of all meaning. \n\nMy wife and I would have loved to sit down and contemplate the beauty of the sculpture but we were denied the chance.

And I'm glad it was a tougher one for me because I was in need of a good distraction today while I await an appointment I'm very nervous about! Ha, nervous!

And yes, I'm quite nervous...  to the extent I couldn't focus on work this morning and instead, I threw myself into games—so it was nice this was one of my slowest Tuesdays. \n\nI got a kick out of each theme entry—especially the aptness of WORCESTERSHIRE. That one really made me laugh, as it does every time I pull the bottle out of the cupboard. I figured it out well before I could remember how to properly spell the CEST. Ah, c'est la vie! \n\nI actually had to do one lookup today. I can't even believe it! It's been AHOTMINUTE since that happened. The funny thing is that the last time was maybe 6 or 8 months ago on another tougher Tuesday. Crazy! The lookup was LUCA, which I just didn't know. I had toyed with COCA, which seemed familiar as a Pixar film. \n\nAnyhow, after trying everything in that area and hitting a mental block, perhaps because I'm not a coffee or LATTE drinker, and not knowing the film. I had ASONE and EROS but also THis instead of THAT, which made me think the unicorn was on some sort of COIN. So, LUCA lookup it was! It's all good!! Fun challenge! \n\nYODELER made me smile—and think of Sound of Music. The WASP misdirect was fun!

I was new once too and didn’t know how to fill in rebuses. I read the link in the column carefully, which is there every single time there is a rebus, and never had a problem since. And again if I didn’t I would have looked at all the other comments first. That’s all. Don’t tell me not to wade through the comments, I enjoy them and learn a lot. I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to just be respectful and do a little homework first. I don’t even mind so much when people ask nicely how to do it, but when people post “this is stupid there’s no way to enter the letters and I can’t get my star” that just burns me up and wastes everyone’s time. I don’t necessarily agree with the rest of Steve L.’s argument entirely—you want to post that the constructor is lazy, that’s fine I’ll just post my rebuttal nicely (but I will think to myself you are ignorant for believing so)—but these constant technical posts about rebuses are unnecessary and I’m not ashamed to say so.","createDate":"1762888610","updateDate":"1762919494","approveDate":"1762888611","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146573693,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146576143","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.48308417201042175}

(I only mention this so that you know that the below did not occur due to any lack of familiarity with English whatsoever).   45 years ago  I was taking a written essay test in my English class.

What the heck is it?\".  It felt like it took my brain minutes to figure it out, if when it was only 10 to 20 seconds.   Nonetheless it was a really scary feeling that has stuck with me for decades.  No idea what l why my synapses were misfiring on that word only....a two letter word that I had written thousands of times in my life at that point, but regardless it just goes to say that even the simplest of words can be hard to spell if you of your brain doesn't remember seeing them before.","createDate":"1762881818","updateDate":"1762905488","approveDate":"1762881819","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146573810,"parentUserDisplayName":"The X-Phile","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146574606","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6048474907875061}
