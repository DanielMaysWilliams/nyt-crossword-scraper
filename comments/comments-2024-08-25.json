After seeing the word ‚Äúfun‚Äù show up often in the comments, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone.  \n\nI sense the twinkle in John‚Äôs eyes in his puzzles, and heck, you can see it in his headshot on XwordInfo.\n\nJohn sets a high bar, spending 100 hours just coming up with the theme answer set for this puzzle.  That‚Äôs before coming up with a grid design, a decent total answer set, and the cluing.  Do you know how long it takes to clue a Sunday puzzle, actually coming up with novel clues rather than just repeating clues from the past?  Many, many more hours.\n\nThe non-theme cluing, IMO, was one of the best parts of this puzzle ‚Äì with so much spark, such as in this trio of never-before-used clues: [Shock proof?] for GASP, [Park worker?] for VALET, and [Tiger‚Äôs target] for PAR.\n\nThe theme answers that took so long for him to come up with ‚Äì and I believe if you try to come up with some good ones yourself, you‚Äôll see why ‚Äì were simply lovely overall, including the world-class worth-the-price-of-admission THIS BEAR‚ÄôS REPEATING for [Pooh-pooh?].\n\nWhen a puzzle is a mood lifter in addition to being a brain pleaser, it‚Äôs a gift.
