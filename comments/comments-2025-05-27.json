I assume that most, if not all, article-pages have a section on which readers can leave comments. My question is--are these glitches happening on all reader comment forums*, or just on Wordplay.\n\nOf course, the comments on this forum serve a different purpose from many--sort of a club-house for like-minded persons, on which to gather and play that Glass Bead Game we call Wordplay. We swap stories, opinions, songs, even recipes! We have *conversations*. Sometimes we argue, but in general the tone is positive, at least towards one another. Political commentary is kept to a minimum, and, when expressed, usually veiled. Of the core group of regular posters, when someone ceases to post, their absence is noticed.\n\nDoes this sort of camaraderie happen on other articles or columns? I don't know, but I doubt it.

When she brings it into the home, I go, \"Why???\"  But she likes it, even though it wouldn't even qualify as cheese in Europe.\n\nBut we occasionally also eat BRIE.  Baked brie is a common way to eat it, and since I don't like the taste of the rind, it works well for me, as I can avoid it.  The brie is placed in an baking dish, and you heat the whole thing up until it is gooey.  There is usually fruit on the top, notably figs, caramelized apples or pears, or berries. Served this way, brie is definitely a spread.\n\n<a href=\"https://entertainingwithbeth.com/baked-brie-with-fig-jam\" target=\"_blank\">https://entertainingwithbeth.com/baked-brie-with-fig-jam</a>/","createDate":"1748350270","updateDate":"1748383845","approveDate":"1748350271","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142404921,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142408653","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5150735974311829}

(If you're not that kind of a person, you are on an uphill climb.)\n\nSo we understand [EPA banner] because:\na. we know what the EPA is,\nb. we understand the punny meaning of \"banner\",\nc. and we remember or know what it was that the EPA banned many years ago.\n\nWe know who LI PO was from either being familiar with his works, or merely because we've heard his name.\n\nWe know what a STOAT is and that the giveaway in the clue is the white fur.\n\nWe somehow know that duck hunters hide in a duck BLIND while hunting, even though we may never have done so ourselves.\n\nAlso, rather than blaming the puzzle if we're not at this level yet, we learn from every answer we don't know and get better and better every time.\n\nThere are still new things that I learn by solving puzzles.  But I can always solve by using the crosses, or by inferring the missing letters using our knowledge base (e.g. House of Tang points to a Chinese--or at least East Asian--answer for LI PO).\n\nIf you go through the week expecting every clue and answer to be like [Pet that meows]/CAT, you're going to be complaining a lot.","createDate":"1748380624","updateDate":"1748423982","approveDate":"1748380624","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142423547,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shari Coats","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142425115","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5281755328178406}
