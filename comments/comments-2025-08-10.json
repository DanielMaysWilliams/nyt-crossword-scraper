Not as intimidating as the volumetric flask, with its weird single-marked neck atop a ridiculously big-bottomed bottom.  And those glass stoppers that you could never find when you needed them.  (I did love that the stopper was designed with a tab to be held between two fingers so you could take the top off and still have mostly two hands to work with.)\n\nMuch more aesthetic than the beaker, which, though useful, was where I was more likely to toss my trash solutions.  I never gave the beaker much respect.  Just a glorified kitchen glass.\n\nThe graduated cylinder was gorgeous, so tall and slender.  But they always felt to me like they were going to tip over and spill my solution and break the glassware all in the same once.\n\nBut the Erlenmeyer--what a flask!  The graduation marks didn't do volumes as well as the volumetric or the graduated cylinders, but they were certainly were more accurate than beakers.\n\nAnd there was nothing in the world better made for swirling.  The quintessential chemistry cliche is a lab-coated scientist swirling an Erlenmeyer, looking at a beautiful colored solution through a pair of lab glasses.  Rarely happened.\n\nI always felt confident with the Erlenmeyer: stable, handy, not too expensive, relatively easy to wash (unlike the awful volumetric flask).  Just the all-round great piece of lab equipment.\n\nSorry, got carried away.","createDate":"1754806940","updateDate":"1754897007","approveDate":"1754806942","recommendations":59,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144164397","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-10","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.809755802154541}

So much of Colorado is desolate prairie, which has a subtle kind of beauty, but I got tired of it.  But I agree other parts are breathtaking.\n\nI have a very complicated relationship to Colorado.  As a Puebloan, I contact the University of Colorado in Boulder for an application to college.  They sent me a reply saying their \"non-resident quota was already filled\".  \n\nI know Pueblo wasn't the most chic part of Colorado, but it was in fact a part of Colorado, despite how much northern Colorado ignored southern Colorado.\n\nI didn't even bother to apply at the University of Colorado for grad school because I had already set my sights out of state.  I went to Boulder for a talk from a prof at U of W, Madison because I was interested in doing graduate study there.
