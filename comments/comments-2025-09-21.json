Still, I had enough crosses almost all over the place to try and complete the puzzle. At this stage I was still clueless about the theme.\n\nStrangely, what revealed the theme to me was the crossing of TONKATSU - a term I only learned from these puzzles very recently - and WRECK IT RALPH - a film I've never seen, but the title of which I remembered for the strangest reason: because I was never able to understand it. I saw it a few times in comments to memes on imgur, when I still browsed it regularly 5 or 10 years ago. I never could parse it. Is some guy Ralph's nickname \"Wreck it\"? Is somebody telling Ralph to wreck something: \"Wreck it, Ralph!\" Or is the title about something else?\n\nOnce I got my first themed entry, I filled in the revealer - doing things backward. Now I finally felt hopefully about completing the puzzle. I looked up much of the ARCANA (ironic how that was an entry today, eh? A gimme, unlike ARCANA such as MSNBC or SEA Island) and proceeded to deal with the remaining four themed crossings and the rest of the grid.\n\nThe theme was quite cool and well implemented into the grid.
