In fact, I'll bet you have heard one famous \"AIR\" many, many times. On more than one occasion, it may have brought a combination of a smile and a tear simultaneously.  I'm referring to an air by J.S. Bach that has probably been played as a wedding processional you've attended -- or been a part of. It's called \"AIR ON THE G STRING.\" \nTake a listen here:\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GMkmQlfOJDk\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/GMkmQlfOJDk</a>\nSee?\nHINT: That title has also been applied less sedately in reference to burlesque performers' attire. But, that's another thong (sic) entirely.","createDate":"1740569692","updateDate":"1740611578","approveDate":"1740569694","recommendations":8,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140103479","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5114843249320984}

Even after Numa’s time, the Greeks weren’t exactly an administratively unified entity—they had wildly different regional calendars that wouldn’t have been easy to copy even if Rome had wanted to. It’s not like the Greeks had a single “official” calendar handbook lying around for a young Rome to adopt.\n\nThat and, while there are numerous primary sources chronicling the evolution of the Roman calendar, I’m not aware of any ancient historians discussing any Greek connection at length. I’m open to looking at evidence to the contrary, of course, but you’d have to start us off with a couple of cites. \n\nThe other thing is your assumption no one really knows why certain months numbered x many days. Many historians have written on the subject extensively, as a matter of fact. I’m going to grossly simplify it here: The lunar cycle is 29.5 days. Since even numbers were inauspicious, Roman priests had to get that average from 29- and 31-day months, while also preserving the maximum number of nundiae for certain months—and of course serving their own political ends.","createDate":"1740584565","updateDate":"1740588826","approveDate":"1740584565","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140106311,"parentUserDisplayName":"Fact Boy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140109918","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6829479932785034}
