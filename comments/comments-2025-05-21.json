We met in the \"Cruciverb\" Facebook group, which is where I met my mentor (now NYT rockstar) Christina several years ago in the same fashion: as a new constructor looking for feedback on a few early construction attempts. I have to say, it was a bit awkward for this 50-something man to dole out constructive criticism to a younger woman whose puzzle included the theme entry MANSPLAINING—it's like I was asking for trouble! Nonetheless, I persevered because I wanted to pay Christina's kindness forward. Who knew it would ultimately result in today's puzzle?\n\nFor aspiring constructors, the editing staff's wise advice Ilana referenced: they wished all of our theme entries had more transformative clues. While STAY AT HOME DAD [Going shopping without you, Pop!] and STUDY BUDDY [Hit the books, slacker!] were cute, they were too literal; STAY AT HOME and STUDY change parts of speech, but the general meaning is unchanged. This made them less clever than, say, TWISTED SISTER or BLOCKBUSTER. Wordplay is key.\n\nTo Ilana: thanks for the \"mentor\" props. It's an honor, even if I don't consider myself anyone's mentor. This was a true collaboration. How awesome is it that the very first idea we worked on together is running in today's New York Times??

This approach could be intended to streamline the viewing experience, reducing clutter in threads with many nested responses. However, I understand this makes the VAR function appear inconsistent, especially since it used to show after 3 replies, and now it’s not triggering reliably.\n \nYour workaround of clicking the timestamp to display all replies, and the fact that emailed links show all replies, aligns with this explanation, the timestamp likely forces a full thread reload, including nested replies, while the email link bypasses the streamlined view. I’ve tested the thread you shared, and I can confirm the VAR button isn’t consistently appearing, which suggests a potential change in how we display replies.\n \nI'll note this ticket as feedback for our team to review and consider as we continue to look for future improvements for our solvers, thank you.\nLovedeep D.\nCustomer Support Specialist\nThe New York Times\"\n\nI know others here have also received similar comments and it appears that the faulty functioning of the View All Replies button is/was part of a deliberate attempt at \"streamlining\" the readers experience.","createDate":"1747854661","updateDate":"1747887999","approveDate":"1747854663","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142276549,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142295103","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8277530074119568}

So Cul de Sac centers around Alice, the 4-year old with the red hair. Couple of days ago she saw a glove that freaked her out a bit. She’s four. Then a toddler walked up and said uh oh. Alice and her friend then proceed to run around shouting about the portent of doom.  This is vocabulary that no four year old has. None. I’d say most adults too. \n\nThe long running joke about Cul de Sac is that it’s very much adult humor dressed as kid’s humor. Alice has a brother that is very weird and precocious. Her parents are a strange combo of parental and nerdy. Plus the drawing appears simplistic but is in fact not. Just watching Alice’s hair is part of the humor. And even the name is funny. A cul de sac is a dead end street with a big circle at the dead end so a car can turn around easily. In the strip, the name of the town is Cul de Sac. Suburban US is filled with cul de sacs, so the strip is a parody of American life in the suburbs. \n\nThe strip is definitely an acquired taste. Plus yeah, humor is so keyed to culture.

The Erinyes demand the case be REHEARd, but no! A&A, Attorneys-at law, recruit them into some \"convict rehabilitation program,\" and rename the Eumenides.\n\nEons later, they are hired by the NYT Puzzles and Games Dept., where they revert to their original personae, under the names of the Emunides.\n\nLinus of Thrace was the music teacher of Heracles. Herc wasn't the best of students, didn't always sing in tune. During one fateful lesson, and exasperated Linus cried out \"No, No, Ercole mio!
