I was recovering from the clamor & cacophony of complaints that surrounded the Saturday puzzle, a veritable uproar/ mishmash of words, when I opened the Monday grid. Then I noticed the tag on my three-piece suit's front collar was falling off. Oh well.

Truth or ………… definitely made my night ‼️. Like some others have said in the comments tonight (and on many other occasions) I do not understand all the complaining and unkind comments- I have been doing the puzzle since the beginning of the pandemic and have always gained so much more than not.  When and if a puzzle just becomes impossible for me I leave it and someday I will go back to it (maybe), and I am totally ok with that.    \nMy point is that I believe puzzles are to be enjoyable as well as interesting - for me they are great learning tools as well.  They keep me motivated and curious to learn more about solving techniques - as well as looking up new words, places and languages - life long learning - I have learned that it is of the utmost importance as well as humbling to say “wow, I did not know that and now I have learned something new” - in a world where so many say they know everything about everything I am grateful to say that at 71 there is still much to learn in this world.  \nI am an educator with over 30  years experience with various Degrees, and hope that I never stop learning from NYT crosswords, my incredible students that I mentor part time, and the privilege of the rich life experiences I have had the opportunity to participate in.   And last but certainly not least ALL OF YOU ☮️🌷\nThank you 🤗\nMs. Dale","createDate":"1713760635","updateDate":"1713852404","approveDate":"1713760639","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132702072,"parentUserDisplayName":"Becca","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132703149","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9550427794456482}
