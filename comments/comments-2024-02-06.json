When an answer is 2 or more words, you enter it all in a run, as if it were all one word. The NYT puzzle clues do not tell you if an answer is more than one word. (Puzzle clues in other places sometimes do indicate the word count.)\n\nFor instance, 34A is clued as Not yet up. The answer is two words, IN BED. But there is no space between IN and BED in the grid.\n\nFor today's theme, having no spaces in the grid between words means you can read the answers in more than one way. You can \"parse\" 17A SPICEDRUM as SPICE DRUM or SPICED RUM.\n\nThis is also called a DOOK here in puzzleland, from a puzzle where the answer was DO OK, but many people just couldn't see that and thought it was a single word DOOK.

It consists of what Christians call the \"Old Testament\", and II Chronicles is the last book of it.  There's nothing after it.  Christian Bibles use a different order, so that EZRA comes after II Chronicles in their Old Testament.  \n\n(Jews don't use \"Old Testament\" because Judaism doesn't have a new testament.  Kinda like WWI wasn't called that until there was a WWII.)\n\nAs for \"Bible\", that mention is not necessary because it's obvious that's what we're talking about.\n\nMr. Shortz has used this clue before and either is unaware, or doesn't care, that it's a very unnecesarily Christocentric way of cluing EZRA.

I'm not a religious person, but I consider myself a very well educated person in the religion in which I was raised (which has led me to my lack of strong belief) and other religions.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible (i.e. Jewish Bible; it is in English, not Hebrew) I just consulted--just to confirm what I was pretty sure I knew--has a First and Second Book of Chronicles.  (And nothing after them.)\n\nI'm not sure if it's done differently in other varieties of Judaism, but that's what I'm familiar with.\n\nAnother thing about Judaism I'm familiar with is that unlike most varieties of Christianity, Jews do not have to pledge a specific creed.  Therefore, there are those who follow strict practices (Orthodox), those who bend those practices to fit modern times (Conservative) and those who are allowed to interpret for themselves how to incorporate--or not to incorporate--those practices into their version of Judaism (Reform).  As a result, whereas a Christian can be excommunicated, a Jew is a Jew for all eternity unless he or she commits to another religion.  So a Jew can be an atheist and still be a Jew.  (Hitler knew that, as did Ferdinand and Isabella.)\n\nTherefore, it's high on my radar when offense is committed against Jews, as we are a people that share a common heritage and a common lot, even when not sharing the same version of the religion.","createDate":"1707230905","updateDate":"1707256978","approveDate":"1707230908","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130965505,"parentUserDisplayName":"Barry Ancona","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130966941","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7781820297241211}
