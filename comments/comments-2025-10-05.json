The theme is almost the same except that the two parts of each answer can be homophones, and the added Ys can be homophones too. So you also get answers like NOSY BESTIE (knows best) and WHINY STORY (wine store). Today's puzzle must have been harder to construct than that one. \n\nThe only section that tripped me up for a while was the NE where I had canDY COPY. That was before I realized that each phrase had to make sense as an expression without the Ys. I don't love the clue for that one since a GOODY is not necessarily sweet or even edible (thinking of goody bags given at birthday parties that can contain trinkets and little toys in addition to sweet treats.) I'm not saying it's wrong, but I would have omitted \"sweet\" and left it at \"treat.\"","createDate":"1759643822","updateDate":"1759696890","approveDate":"1759643822","recommendations":9,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145729501","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8139339089393616}

Since you can't wind down to two teams when you start with 12, the top four teams, based on season won-lost records, sit out the first round, while the others play the first round.  Those top teams automatically advance to the next round.  This is called a BYE.  After the other eight teams play the first round, four teams emerge, and they play the four teams who had a bye.  Eight now goes down to four, then to two, who play in the World Series for the championship.\n\nThe NFL also used the term BYE slightly differently.  Every team plays 17 games, but the season is 18 weeks long.

There are always citations given (8 in the case of \"amuck\").  And modern languages document usage (descriptivism) rather than lecture on so-called proper usage (prescriptivism).  That's left to English professors and style guides that set a certain perceived \"standard\" of usage at a higher level.  (The acceptable level for crosswords is simply that the word exists.)\n\nGoogle Ngram Viewer shows that although the less common variant, \"amuck\" is used about 1/4 as often as \"amok,\" certainly a greater-than-zero number.  The two ran neck-and-neck until the 70s, when \"amok\" became more prevalent.\n\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=amok\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=amok</a>%2Camuck&year_start=1800&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3\n\nThe Daffy Duck cartoon short, \"Duck Amuck,\" was released in 1953, so you could hardly say this usage is a trendy neologism that those darned kids came up with.  In fact, another look at the Ngram shows that both forms existed 125 years ago, when the \"amuck\" spelling was actually more common.\n\n\"Amuck\" is also found in Cambridge, Collins and Britannica.
