Then there were clue/answer combos like copacetic/JAKE - impossibly hard for a foreigner (and this one crossed with the enigmatic JAPE, too), with an icing of US-specific trivia (NBA DRAFT is probably well known to a hundred million people, if not more, but I would never have figured it out). Other than that the puzzle was very easy, and I enjoyed many clues - the one for LAVA was brilliant and I got it instantly.

That wins me over to where I’m forgiving of anything that would normally turn me off in a grid.  But there was nothing that put me off anyway.  Terrific execution all around.\n\nMy solve was of the before/after variety.  Before cracking the theme, there was plenty of splendid bite through tricky cluing amid the riddle of the theme itself.  After the theme fell, so did the grid, in a splat, with much “Whee!” \n\nScanning the completed puzzle, I liked seeing the schwa-start party, with six in the grid, including the entire second row with AFAR, AMID, and AKITA.  Also, I learned “plein-air painting” – that’s a keeper – and I learned “ensiform”, which I’m guessing will slip out of my memory soon enough.

The discussions are generally goldilocksish--too hard, too easy, or just right. Individual perceptions are, of course, welcome, but we might also acknowledge that solvers come with a wide variety (possibly normal curve) of solving skills and abilities. The senior guard members have decades of experience solving NYT puzzles. They've seen everything and are quite skilled. Newer solvers (I've been at it for about 3 years) are not as skilled. A puzzle that an experienced solver might find \"too easy\" is likely rather difficult for a less-experienced person.\nI know it's much too much to ask of the editors, but as membership continues to grow, they might consider novice, intermediate, and expert modes to satisfy a larger swath of solvers.\nThat said, as soon as I read a comment about a puzzle's difficulty, I scroll on. It's an opinion (everyone has one like other anatomical features) that doesn't add value to my experience. I peruse the posts that contain interesting anecdotes, alternative clues/answers, explanations, and other ideas that enhance my experience.\nPost as you feel fit, but let's all take a moment to wonder if we're contributing or merely spouting.

This was especially frustrating for theme entries because I actually loved the theme and figured it out on my own (after a lot of head scratching), but even with some crossings already filled in, many of my initial answers ended up being wrong (mad hatter, no vacancy) and I lacked adequate crossings to easily determine that, to the point where I thought there might be a X/X style rebus (to make all or part of the answer fit the literal meaning of each clue) until I came to to column for help. \n\nPlease don’t misunderstand this as a complaint over difficulty. I love difficult puzzles, often even those that really stump me early on (I’m looking at you, open grid Fridays). Today for me just wasn’t a fun challenge, and the things I was stuck on felt arbitrary rather than cleverly misdirecting.","createDate":"1708621504","updateDate":"1708752764","approveDate":"1708621506","recommendations":6,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131342508","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-22","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7376852035522461}

Some of the things I remember sometimes, but that's it. And I have the most problems with remembering stuff that I don't care about, like most sports. Also, there are so many ways to clue the things that are alien to me - a college sports team may be referred to by its own full name or short name, or various versions of the name of its college, and also by its nickname, city, state, conference, mascot, and more. I will never remember all of that for all of the teams, especially as they often engage in sports I care nothing about, so I will never see any of them play.\n\nI am and will always remain a foreigner here, in more ways than one.","createDate":"1708586810","updateDate":"1708753373","approveDate":"1708586812","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131330648,"parentUserDisplayName":"Pani Korunova","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131330870","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6192206740379333}

There are many of us who enjoy the challenges presented by Thursday puzzles, which have included rebuses, hidden letters, backwards spelling, and more. I'm amazed as to what constructors have come up with, and the fact that most of us have figured out how to solve them. And no, we don't want to know the theme until we figure it out. It's called a puzzle for a reason.\n\nIf you're strictly a casual solver, I'd suggest sticking to Sun.-Wed. puzzles, where the themes are going to be a little more obvious.","createDate":"1708661490","updateDate":"1708988590","approveDate":"1708661492","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131357928,"parentUserDisplayName":"Aaron","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131358015","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8199594020843506}
