A saga is a prose narrative written in a spare, chiseled style that resembles the writings of Ernest Hemingway. A saga is a sort of novel. The so-called Younger Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson ca. 1200 AD, is a poetic — a manual for poets. It contains a catalogue of verse forms, a dictionary of convoluted metaphors called kenningar, and a source book of mythological lore for use by poets. The Elder Edda, compiled later than the Snorra Edda, is an anthology of short narratives written in alliterative  verse. Snorri wrote his poetic in an atavistic effort to revive ancient forms of poetry 200 years after Christianity had replaced the heathen pantheon and the old poetic forms had been supplanted by uncomplicated songs using end rhyme and were so uninteresting that few have  been preserved.","createDate":"1732492758","updateDate":"1732613226","approveDate":"1732492761","recommendations":20,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137851898","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8867471218109131}

Not quite, and thus I needed a few crosses to get the revealer.  But at least I got part of the way there – small steps.\n\nAnd my brain loved the workout in trying to figure it out.\n\nIt also enjoyed scanning the completed grid and finding a trio of accessories (TIES, SASH, ANKLET), a quintet of “A” sandwiches (ARENA, ALA, AHA, ALDA, ALGA), and a pair of symmetrical rhymes (LASH and SASH), not to mention seeing that ANO is preceded by a word that contains it (HANOI).  \n\nAlso, a word I adore, PATINA.  My heart smiles and warms all over when it comes across that word.\n\nDena, congratulations on your NYT debut, and it is clear that with a Friday in the queue, you have range.

That cost a lot less, so she bought me a ring with a heart-shaped rose zircon for my birthday. I loved that ring, but the one time I took it off it went missing. Only later did I realize that it was a fake, like cubic zirconia instead of diamonds.
