I've been operating on that basis for quite a while now, but every so often I come across a puzzle that seems at first like it's going to be THE ONE.\n\nThis was one such puzzle.\n\nWhen I'm good and stuck, I fall back on my intuition and guess at answers I don't know, realizing that they might make some crosses obvious, and just as easily, might need to be removed.\n\nIt's rare that my intuition has failed me so many times.  I thought the White Russians were FASCISTS, because I had the C from the show that I thought was CATS, which also led me to PIELS instead of PABST.\n\nI had CREED instead of CREDO, which put a double E before before (something something) SEAT, leading me to put LAST FREE SEAT for 36A.  I had CACTI for CROCI at 46A, which told me to put CONE at 48D, and forced me to take it out of 45A.  (At least that one worked out by luck.) Had ALIEN for 26A (WALL-E) because I didn't read the clue carefully, but then took it out because 26D had to be WISER.\n\nIt didn't occur to me that the London in 38A was in Ontario.\n\nI did guess right on IT STINKS, UH OH OREO (at least the second half), OPEN MRI, MIENS, B SIDE, DOGIES (after briefly putting HORSES), THUDS.\n\nNEED I SAY MORE?","createDate":"1712371847","updateDate":"1712487869","approveDate":"1712371849","recommendations":17,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132355211","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5072014927864075}

Let me explain.  In the style of yoga (Ashtanga) that I practice, I find that there are certain difficult poses and transitions between poses that I just can’t do if I try too hard.  But if I shut my conscious brain off and let it go still, success follows.  That is, I cede control to my mysterious inner world.  That is how I have to approach a Walden, and it helps greatly.\n\n•\tI know that a BW Saturday will have world-class twisted cluing, where, when the answer hits me I want to stand, bow, and shake my head in amazement, bathed in pleasure.  Places it happened today: [Pictures where people are headscarfed?] for ZOMBIE MOVIES, [Dodger’s foes, for short] for IRS, and [Can’t we all just git along?] for DOGIES.\n\n•\tSometimes the cluing and difficulty hide what is always a feature of a BW Saturday: freshness.  There is always a wealth of answers that have never appeared in the NYT puzzle’s 80 years.  Today there were 11, including IT STINKS, NEED I SAY MORE, RUN PAST, and ZOMBIE MOVIES.\n\nByron, you really don’t need to put your name atop your puzzles, as they have your personality shining throughout.

Maybe it's a \"request to chat\" and maybe it's a request to put away some groceries or see what the cat is up to.  Not a fair clue.\n\nDon't even get me started on TOYCON in the SE.  Now if I'd only known PRYOR and if I'd only known CROCI...\n\nWould it have helped?  No idea -- but why-oh-why was I too proud to cheat?

It's a complicated reaction, and if you only like puzzles that may be too hard for others, but are easier for you, you're kidding yourself.\n\nNone of the clues in the puzzle were wrong, and some answers were even deceptively simple and some might have been a bit of a stretch, but in the many decades I have spent working crosswords, I never assumed that a constructor was trying to make me \"cheat\"—the lack was mine, and I would just have to get better.","createDate":"1712421163","updateDate":"1712468859","approveDate":"1712421166","recommendations":28,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132364110","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-06","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6238797307014465}

No.\n\nFinally: a PINT is not a “Cup alternative.” It is two cups. I understand that clues are not definitions, but this one is simply and plainly wrong, because it refers to measurements — which by definition are not “alternatives” for each other. Even if you stretched and said that PINT was standing in for a glass of beer, it doesn’t make sense. You don’t have a “cup” of beer, or of wine or any other alternative to beer. \n\nNEED I SAY MORE?\n\nI have avoided the chorus of people criticizing Joel Fagliano.

This was way out of my league! That said, I kept at it. After a first few passes, I was toeholdless.

It's only a puzzle, but I wanted to cry as I erased all my other seemingly reasonable answers. \n\nI kept filling in wrong answers for a while, checking puzzle after every 5 or so. Finally, I allowed myself to look at the first two of Caitlin's tricky clues. I filled those in and was able to start building. I allowed myself one more look up of a short answer, Dodger's foe, for IRS. I didn't want to reveal anything big, and figured it was a sports clue that I wouldn't know anyhow. From there, very painstakingly, I got the entire North filled in without any more lookups, though I did keep doing check puzzle after every 5 entries, but now they were correct. It seems I started to understand the clues better or twist my brain differently to see them better. \n\nShockingly, I didn't need help for anything south of NEED I SAY MORE. I began to enjoy it.

It makes me frustrated, and when I get too frustrated, I'm going to just look something up.\n\nI've noticed I'm the same way with video games.  When I play a game, if I get stuck on a hard part, I'll usually give it the old college try, but if I'm just getting absolutely nowhere, I'll look up what to do in a guide.  I don't have fun if my progress is stopped for too long.  I may even drop the game if it just becomes a slog of bad boss fights, extremely repetitive gameplay, or constant Moon Logic puzzles.\n\nSome people relish the challenge.  They'll sit there and stare at it, thinking through all of the possibilities in their head, and they'll try numerous things.  They get an endorphin rush when they finally solve it.\n\nI don't.  My frustration only increases when I see the answer and how inane or crazy it was.  I'm not likely to think something is clever.  I'm more likely to think, \"Why didn't you clue that in a way where a typical solver would have any chance of solving it?!\" and feel bad afterwards.\n\nNeither way of solving is wrong, per se.

It is absolutely true that one can become an expert solver over time and experience little difficulty with challenging puzzles. (I'm certainly not yet an expert.) It's also true that the things that make a particular puzzle challenging can be annoying, even to skilled solvers.\n\nIt's also true that the NYT is a business and certainly wants more customers, so it is natural that a puzzle columnist might say that everyone can do the NYT puzzle in an attempt to encourage newer solvers. But I don't think that translates to: \"We're dumbing down the puzzles to make them more accessible.\" I'd imagine that most solvers who get hooked learn to like the resistance that puzzles offer and seek greater resistance over time. During that process, they're likely to join this conversation and express, among other things, frustration, and I love to see the encouragement offered by veterans.\n\nIn any case, civility is an essential quality of this blog and commentariat, what makes it unique among many other online forums.

Wonderful false Canadian etymologies in Wikipedia:\n\n\"A popular origin story holds that in outdoor ice hockey before ice resurfacers, the losing team in a hockey game would have to hose down the rink after a game to make the ice smooth again. Thus the term hoser was synonymous with loser. Another suggestion for the origin of the term involves farmers of the Canadian Prairies who would siphon gasoline from farming vehicles with a hose during the Great Depression of the 1930s. \"Hosed\" is also a euphemism for drunkenness in Canadian English, and by extension a hoser is one who is drunk.\n\n\"Another possible origin may stem from loggers' slang, where \"hoosier\" referred contemptuously to an untrained, inept, or slack worker.\n\n\"One theory is that it was derived from the term \"hose bag\" which was a popular insult amongst suburban Toronto high school students in the 1970s. The term was shortened to \"hoser\" to thwart the rebuffs of school teachers and parents who found \"hose bag\" offensive.\n\n\"The term hoser was used frequently on the U.S. sitcom How I Met Your Mother in relation to main character Robin Scherbatsky, who was a native of Canada. She sometimes visited a Canadian-themed bar, Hoser Hut.\"\n\n\"I shall now visit my home Hoser Hut to celebrate today's NYT Crossword Canadiana!","createDate":"1712419302","updateDate":"1712427729","approveDate":"1712419304","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132361795,"parentUserDisplayName":"John","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132363274","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8710789680480957}

Mr. Walden's notes lead me to believe he anticipated pushback against this puzzle...and clearly he was correct.\n\nHuge challenge for me. It took me over 50 minutes, even with looking up the cave, the random programmer, and yes, the lowly OREO. (After completing the puzzle--to calculate the appropriate level of outrage over its inclusion--I sacrificed a few minutes of my life researching how long it was in existence, as I had never heard of it, even having had young kids at the time of its birth. Sadly, I was only able to learn that it debuted in 2003.) The east was a fairly clean solve, progressing from north to south, but by no means quickly. The west...probably the less said the better.\n\nI like a difficult Saturday puzzle--practically live for them, in fact. However, hard isn't always quality. For example, I got ZOMBIE MOVIES from crosses but didn't understand until I read the column. Get the joke now, but Saturday or not, head and scarf should have been separate. Headscarf as a compound means only one thing; much too imprecise for the answer. (In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody, somewhere might be mildly offended by this usage.)  Similarly, CINDERELLA UPSET clued by \"calling card,\" not a fan. A calling card is one's trademark. CINDERELLA's were the glass slippers, right? Much too convoluted. And I don't think I can add anything to the conversation that hasn't already been said about the ultimate STINKer: BAD THING...\n\nTo be continued below:","createDate":"1712425678","updateDate":"1718400406","approveDate":"1712425680","recommendations":30,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132365896","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5179941654205322}

Heck, if you solve on mobile or iPad like I do, you’ll never know unless you click the info button in the upper right.

There's something about being able to successfully complete a puzzle that can make you appreciate both your memory and your awareness of the world around you.
