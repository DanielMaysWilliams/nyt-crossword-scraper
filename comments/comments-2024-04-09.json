In eclipses past, some of the larger mammals at the local zoo had immediately started mating during the greatest darkness, but Louie and I did not feel those urges, toward each other or anybody else.

I had the whole puzzle solved with the theme entries entered as a split rebus: ex. WARREN BUFF E/I T (to maintain the correct spellings in both directions). When I didn’t get the music, I changed them to I’s and was rewarded. \n\nI have always thought that the NYT doesn’t allow intentional misspellings (also confused by YADDA and LOOPER - I’ve never seen YADA spelled that way and I’ve always only heard BLOOPER). One of the reasons I almost exclusively choose to do the NYT puzzle is that I know they are well edited and solvable with real words. When I consulted my trusty “How to Conquer the New York Times Crossword Puzzle” book by Amy Reynaldo (an excellent help for new solvers!), however, I was surprised not to find that basic rule.\n\nSo, my question for the editors is why not do it as a split rebus and maintain the correct spellings of people’s names and have the theme come out in how it’s pronounced rather than how it’s spelled?\n\nAlso, as a person with a weirdly spelled name, I prefer spelling people’s names correctly.

I'm walking down the hill that leads from the bridle path at East 97th street to the tennis courts.  On the grass adjacent to the hill, an irresistible Golden Retriever (my favorite breed) is cavorting off-leash, sporting a wide smile that would melt anyone's heart.  I do not even notice its person at first. \n\nIts person is a tall woman dressed in understated dog-walking clothes and I say something to her about the sheer wonderfulness of her dog.  She says something back to me-- very curt, not at all warm and fuzzy -- and scurries off up the hill I have just come down.  And while I don't recognize her face at all, I'm struck by that VOICE!  I know that VOICE! It's the voice of an actress.  Whose voice IS it????  I have to know.  I HAVE TO KNOW!!\n\nAnd by the time I get to the bottom of the hill, I DO know.  It's CATE BLANCHETT.  Leaving me with two ways to interpret the incident:\n\n1) CATE BLANCHETT is not a very nice person and, besides, she's sick and tired of having her life interrupted by gawking strangers because of her celebrity status.\n\n2) CATE BLANCHETT likes being recognized. She EXPECTS to be recognized.  And she certainly doesn't like playing second fiddle to a...dog!","createDate":"1712674339","updateDate":"1712691505","approveDate":"1712674342","recommendations":11,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132428635","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-09","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8328720331192017}

Drive ten more minutes, and they're asking for your passport.  Plattsburgh was on the line of maximum totality, and that meant over three minutes of nighttime darkness and a corona that you could look at without the glasses.  Believe me, compared to even a 95% partial eclipse, it's a whole different story.\n\nI was at a state park on Lake Champlain, and when totality hit, everyone there was dead silent, except for one woman near me who kept shouting, \"This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen\" over and over again.  When totality ended, the sun came back out with a burst of light like the Enterprise makes on the Star Trek opening credits.\n\nOnce, totality ended, people started heading back to their cars.  And back to NYC, it seems.  What was a 4.5 hour trip up was double that coming home.  Google Maps told me I was going to have a similar time going back (not knowing that everyone everywhere was going to hit the same one road at the same time), and it was still saying 4.5 more hours three hours into the ride.  It told me at one point I was in a 55-minute delay, and I was on the fastest route.  That was a new one for me!\n\nWas it worth it?
