Would've preferred to do as instructed, connect the letters and make the hat, but it did it by itself. Oh well. Que seurat seurat. \n\nPoetry lesson, January 14. \"Burnt Norton\" is where that line first appeared, a long poem, first of the Four Quartets,  published in slim volumes by Faber & Faber between 1941 & 1945. Those unfamiliar with Burnt Norton might think it's a reference to some English hamlet bombed by the Germans. Actually it's the name of a large manor house in Gloucestershire with splendid gardens, famous for its roses and its complex of paths and byways. Eliot visited there in 1934 and saw in the diverging paths a metaphor for time and its phenomenological paradoxes:\n\nTime present and time past\nAre both perhaps present in time future,\nAnd time future contained in time past.\nIf all time is eternally present\nAll time is unredeemable.\nWhat might have been is an abstraction \nRemaining a perpetual possibility\nOnly in a world of speculation.\nWhat might have been and what has been\nPoint to one end, which is always present.\nFootfalls echo in the memory\nDown the passage which we did not take\nTowards the door we never opened\nInto the rose-garden. My words echo\nThus, in your mind.\n***\nThus are we drawn into the garden's world. All that philosophical abstraction vanishes, replaced by lyrical imagism, for what is an image but a vortex in space and time? (Ezra Pound's definition). War does appear, how could it not? Eliot ponders how war warps time, and vice versa.","createDate":"1768362755","updateDate":"1768460348","approveDate":"1768362757","recommendations":50,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148040862","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7526795268058777}

Love the musical, have watched the recorded version several times with Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters (you can probably stream it or watch it online). Stephen Sondheim is an acquired taste and it’s definitely not a TOETAPPER, but it’s a very beautiful and evocative show about the nature of art and probably my second favorite Sondheim musical (behind Company and above Into the Woods). I highly recommend it. “Look I Made a Hat” is also the name of Sondheim’s biography, so it’s not just a random lyric but a meaningful concept of art creating something that didn’t exist before (like a crossword puzzle, in fact).\nAnyway, not a bad crossword even apart from the theme, with some unexpected clues, and I enjoyed it.\nLast comment just to nip some nitpickers in the bud—yes the name of the painter of “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte” is Georges Seurat (with an S at the end) but the musical is also about his (fictional) great-grandson who is named George and that is whom the title refers. Also, if you are Star Trek fan and watch the original version, you can get a glimpse of Brent Spiner (Data) in a supporting role; I’m afraid that probably won’t be enough to tempt Andrzej, though.","createDate":"1768372159","updateDate":"1768441571","approveDate":"1768372160","recommendations":16,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148042243","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9540039300918579}

One of my fastest Wednesday solves. \n\n I'm an enormous fan of Stephen Sondheim (and was lucky enough in my life to the original Broadway productions of Sweeney Todd, Passion, Into the Woods and Sunday in the Park with George.  And, yes, I guess that's a boast. Though it also means I'm a little old.)  On the other hand, to my eternal shame, at some point in my adult life I came to realize that the \"depressing/not really very good\" Broadway show that my Mom and Dad had walked out of at intermission when I was a child was actually the original  \"Follies\"!   I don't want to say that I love them less for this act of criminally bad taste, but well I guess everyone discovers that their parents were flawed and damaged in some way. LOL. \n\nAnyway - so I was excited when I saw this was a Sondheim-themed puzzle but a little disppointed by the relative sparsity of Sondheim-based answers.  (Although to be fair, a Sondheim-theme really calls out for a Sunday puzzle.)  I didn't even see the \"LOOK I MADE A HAT\" reference until I'd finished the entire board.\n\nGiven that fact, I don't think I can really attribute my speed today to my familiarity with Sondheim as much what I think is otherwise a sort of simple solve.","createDate":"1768404248","updateDate":"1768404249","approveDate":"1768404249","recommendations":0,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148051758","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5453979969024658}

As this is still news to most, I’ll share a little known history behind the song Finishing the Hat. It could have been called Finishing the Game. In 1965 his friend Phyllis Newman had a show flop out of town. He asked what he could do and she said make a game for me when I return. He designed The Murder Game in an overnight 11-hour creative fugue. It was a hit (and has its own story). In the early 80s, creating Sunday in the Park With George, he wanted to write a song about that experience, about disconnecting from the world to pursue a creative pursuit, not to paint something new but to create a playful way for his friends to connect. So now, his song, about a game, has been honored in a crossword. Quite fitting.","createDate":"1768448919","updateDate":"1768480274","approveDate":"1768448921","recommendations":11,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148076177","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9234629273414612}

One line, from a song I've never heard, from a musical I'd never before heard of. Talk about the epitome of trivia! Annoying, but it is what it is.

None of this - absolutely nothing - is making any sense whatsoever. \n\nBeing wholly at sea, I looked up the musical's title on Wikipedia. Finally!

I sometimes find the theme of the puzzle ponderous or uninteresting, but Sondheim is one of the greatest composers and lyricists in American musical history, responsible for creating or contributing to twenty or so musical productions in NYC in a career spanning eight decades.  A Pulitzer Prize winning genius, he also happened to be an avid puzzler and constructor of cryptic crosswords in his own right. In fact, he contributed the puzzle to the debut issue of New York Magazine in 1968, introducing cryptics to a wider audience.  While you may be unaware of his work and legacy, or even uninterested, to me Sondheim is the amalgam of thee elements: music that is brilliant in its compositional construction and harmonic intention, married to deftly wrought lyrics dripping with an uncompromisingly playful use of language, and finally (maybe above all else) the quintessential spirit of New York itself.  For my money, there’s no more apt, or better a theme for a NYT crossword puzzle than Stephen Sondheim.","createDate":"1768416392","updateDate":"1768456415","approveDate":"1768416412","recommendations":15,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148058571,"parentUserDisplayName":"Asher B.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148061436","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7333181500434875}
