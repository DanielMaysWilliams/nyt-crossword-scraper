This is one of those themes that can add an extra challenge – after uncovering the three theme answers, can you guess the revealer?

I've read the comments, so I understand the Venn diagram controversy but it is one of the clues that caught my attention in the moment and made me chuckle. \n\nYesterday, I was going on about how glorious TACOs are (not mere snacks) so today I'll add that they are especially superb when they include salsa verde!  It's my favorite—and TOMATILLO went right in. \n\nAlso, I always love Sam's choice of photos! They are occasionally lost on me but not usually—but they are never spoilers! Not a problem on my phone, but when I solve on my computer, I can't help but see the photo below the puzzle (at least not that I know of), so it's nice when they are funny nods to the puzzle but not spoilers.","createDate":"1718651922","updateDate":"1718671752","approveDate":"1718651925","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133968749","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.3858816921710968}
