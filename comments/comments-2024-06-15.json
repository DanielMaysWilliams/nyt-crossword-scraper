Yesterday, I happened across a piece in The New Yorker by David Sedaris describing, in a way only he can, his and Hugh’s recent safari in Kenya. At one point he was admiring the traditional outfit of a spear-carrying Maasai guard at the camp and observed, “He looked outstanding, as if he’d been dressed by Comme des Garçons.” When he complimented the guard on his clothing, the man offered for David to try on his shawl. Sedaris wanted to explain that in the U.S. this might be called “cultural appropriation”. He mused that he wasn’t exactly sure what the term means, but he thought “it was like when you make a taco with, like, blue cheese on it.” Well today I leaned about “Turkey in the Straw” and ice cream trucks. I also learned about the rapper Jibbs and his debut hit “Chain Hang Low” from 2006. I link the official music video of this catchy tune  below, complete with an ice cream truck.

The best part for me was that I was able to scroll through the comments while listening.  What a happy song that obviously touched a lot of people in a special way. Loved the, “Our next song is gonna be…One More Time!” Maybe think about reposting as an addendum tonight, it’d bring a lot of smiles for sure, perfect for a sweltering Sat night.

I was on a very busy week long work conference and I find it hard to puzzle in airports and airplanes. I prefer my quiet sanctuaries for puzzling. \n\nI used one lookup today. It was O'DAY. The Southwest was my last section. I had struggled through a few tough for me crossings but gotten them. I think if I weren't so tired, only getting back late last night, and were more patient I would have worked it out. I was semi confident of YALE but I kept going back and forth on SATAN or siren at 49A so I struggled to commit to anything. Once I plugged in O'DAY from my lookup, everything fell into place. Except my ego. I should have just come back to it later. I'm confident I would have been able to figure out the rest and fill in O'DAY from the crossings. Oh well, more time to catch up on the rest of my puzzles.\n\nKind of funny: I didn't notice I had the wrong tense for ASPIREs at 32A, so I had sON VITO for the Corleone clue at 33D... After no happy music, I caught that it was the wrong tense pretty quickly and fixed it. I have extremely little knowledge of the Godfather, sON VITO had made as much sense as anything to me at the moment! Briefly I had wondered if it was ALFREDO crossing ALFREDO. 😂 I am so very tired!! \n\nMy favorite was 13 across!
