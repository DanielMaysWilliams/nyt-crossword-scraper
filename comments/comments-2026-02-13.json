Then home to the Tiger Sharks, I would drive the ‘Boni out onto the ice between the periods and make it smooth and supple. I’d wet it down and make it real slick. Now, anyone familiar with hockey knows that the fans tend to get a little rowdy, especially later in the game after a few pitchers from the ol’ ALE TAP, and it wasn’t uncommon for them to hurl various items onto the ice in my general direction, such as empty beer cups, garments of clothing, small odd-toed ungulates, things of that nature, my brothers. Well, one game the crowd was particularly ornery and restless and somebody threw an actual Zamboni out onto the ice. A second Zamboni right onto the rink.  I had my headphones on and was rocking out to my favorite cassette tape, “Phil Collins Plays Stravinsky’s Greatest Hits,” not having noticed the massive obstruction directly ahead, and crashed right into it. I was thrown clear onto the ice, and my rogue Zamboni (now ghost-riding full speed ahead with no driver), ran right over my left leg, shellacking it to a shiny, icy finish. \n\nWell, that was decades ago, but it’s why they still call me “Smooth Foot Rogers” down in the Panhandle, brahs.","createDate":"1771019871","updateDate":"1771045144","approveDate":"1771019871","recommendations":8,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148882418","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8035088181495667}

It's both much simpler and much more complex than that.\n\nFirst, as I have remarked here on multiple occasions, I just don't get or feel poetry in English. It feels strange and alien, generally, and either I have no idea what's going on, at all, or - in a best case scenario - I understand the language but I find it artsy and convoluted rather than special. It doesn't speak to *me*. (One of the many factors may be that in Polish, where I occasionally do get poetry, it is not metered, which in turn is often a feature in English: it's just not something I have ever learned to appreciate since it's not a thing in my native tongue).\n\nNow, second, I simply understand the language of \"The Raven\", which is a good start. I also get the Romantic-era trope of longing after a dead beauty - one of Poe's most common motifs. I like how the words convey the feelings of the lyrical ego, his loss, his obsession, possibly even madness. The poem picks up pace, reflecting the growing terror. There is also the mystery in the background - who exactly was Lenore? What had happened to her? Not knowing contributes to the feeling of dark unease.","createDate":"1770961588","updateDate":"1771014637","approveDate":"1770961588","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148864935,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148865351","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-13","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7904117107391357}

How could I get names from the cross if I couldn’t get the cross? I resorted to a lot of lookups in those days, because a sea of empty white squares looked a lot more like failure than a Google search.\n\nOver time, as I learned how to decipher the more cryptic clues, I relied less and less on lookups. That’s how I knew I was making progress. These days, I usually need them only for adjacent factual bits (like names) that cannot be sussed out or guessed.
