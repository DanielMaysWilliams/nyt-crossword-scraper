I had previously been solving on a platform called Puzzazz, and on Across Lite before that.  For a time, I switched from one platform to another often. So my streak couldn't have even been a year longer.\n\nBut at the time, the idea of a streak was something new, and I guess it didn't matter that much to me back then.

My earliest solves, of course, were erasable pen on paper, so in those days, an unknown answer simply remained unsolved.  \n\nIn those early days, you checked the next day's paper for the solution. Sometimes, I had one letter wrong, but I didn't really care. There was no one to impress. There was no \"community,\" unless your friends were also solvers. (Rex Parker started in 2006; Wordplay in 2008.)\n\nBut in order to check an unknown answer while solving, you had to literally be in a library.  And even then, it would have been cumbersome, and in some cases, impossible.\n\nBy the time the online solving rolled around, I was generally completing all my puzzles. I wouldn't have looked up an answer anyway; not finishing still didn't bother me, and looking things up (once the internet showed up) seemed to me like cheating. (I don't feel that way about newbies incorporating lookups into their solve if they prefer to do so, but I do feel that if you look things up, a gold star isn't the same.)\n\nBy the time I switched to the NYT interface in 2015, I was solidly figuring things out on my own. I realized that constructors want you to solve their puzzles, and what Rex called a Natick wasn't that common at all.\n\nI now feel that I can solve anything the NYT throws at me (especially since they seem to be getting easier).

It relaxes me before sleeping.\n\n(In addition, this habit keeps me from forgetting to solve one day.)\n\nWhen I'm in Europe (or Morocco, as I was in April), I am forced to solve upon waking up, which I don't like as much.\n\nRegardless, my solve doesn't take up that much of my day.  I know some people hate seeing actual times posted, but you know what range I'm talking about. (I'll never regularly solve in the ridiculously fast times of the tournament finalists.  And neither am I aiming to.)\n\nAnd as I said in my reply to Dan, I have no worry that I won't solve the puzzle, so there's no stress involved.\n\nMy life is probably as laid back as yours; maybe more so, since I'm not working anymore.
