Others argue that Hans goes to the mountain, meets new people with new ideas and learns a lot but then returns home to do what he would have done if he never left.\n\nA third group reads it as another literary cliché The Hero's Journey.  They focus particularly on a descent to the Underworld of the xray lab where Hans sees his skeleton, (his grave?), and peppers Dr. Behrens with questions about life, death and illness.  (If that's the Underworld, what does that make Dr. B?) \n\nIn Mann's Forward he writes at length about how he is going to tell the story.  He stresses that the story will be uniquely about Hans and that Hans is a perfectly normal person.  He is not the typical protagonist of those genres.\n\nI submit that Mann is mocking those forms.  I'll reply to this with some evidence if and when it clears the emus.","createDate":"1770872671","updateDate":"1770897310","approveDate":"1770872673","recommendations":2,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148833926","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8963444232940674}

The ibex was often hunted for its meat, with other body parts used for medicine. The ibex horns were highly sought after as a remedy for impotence, while its blood was used for treating kidney stones.\n\nThe relentless hunting of the alpine ibex might have led to its extinction were it not for the foresight of the dukes of Savoy.

To steal a kiss is indeed a thing, and an X as a signoff kiss is indeed a thing, but putting the two together is like saying that dogs have fleas and schoolchildren like to flee after school, so ... I don't know, maybe the dogs should scratch the kids. \nI am therefore with heavy heart tendering my resignation from all crossword solving with the New York Times.

I asked what they'd eaten-- salmon. The word \"scombroid\" popped into my head. I vaguely recalled it might be a type of food poisoning but no details came attached with the word! \n\nSo I told the mom and the med student with me that I had just thought of something but needed to look it up.  I never try to fake pts out... I just say when I don't know. We didn't have computers in the rooms back then. Anyway, bingo, it was classic Scombroid toxin poisoning!

Hans Castorp had neither the one nor the other of these; and thus he must be considered mediocre, though in an entirely honourable sense.”\n\nSettembrini often speaks for Mann.

One not well suited to great deeds.
