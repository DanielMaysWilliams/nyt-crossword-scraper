My boss at Cincinnati Children’s hospital is Dr. Andy Spooner. (Not such a common name, right?) He loves crosswords, is very good at them, knows I’ve published (I’ve challenged him with all my rejects) and has mentioned to me that he’s toyed with writing them. So I see this byline and immediately text him —congratulations, that’s amazing, why didn’t you tell me?\nI finish the puzzle and read the constructor notes and who would believe it, it’s a DIFFERENT Andrew Spooner (my boss is definitely not Australian). How crazy is this!!!\n\nIn any case as I’m doing the puzzle, I’m thinking, well I definitely won’t say anything bad about it—luckily, boss or not, I don’t have to. This is an exceptional puzzle and even more exceptional debut. Love the long crossers and the clues (SPOONRACE is certainly perfect for this constructor). Lots of clever clues, loved the STROLLER clue (and I had TEENS before NANAS for the other babysitting clue) and CELLMATE. I’m sure I won’t be the only one to have BRA for “Broad band” although I was a bit surprised the NYT would allow a somewhat pejorative term for women. Also loved the GEODE and “marked with an X” clues. Overall a nice difficulty level for me and appropriate for a Friday.\nSo congrats Mr. Spooner, whoever you are, for an enchanting debut.

POKE -- a word with a lot of meanings, one of which is a small leather bag or pouch as used by gold miners for gold dust & nuggets, I.e. a MONEY BAG. \n\nAnother is the balancing acts of the  tightrope walker crossing the egg and spoon race. I tried and failed to find footage of some daredevil on a tightrope doing the egg and spoon thing, surmising there would be hundreds of videos. Nada. Wouldn't you watch such a film? Especially if it was a P0RN0 starring a giantess named Miriam wearing only an obi? Will she lose it midway, or will there be a rift in the rope, and was it tied in properly? I promise you there will not be a dry eye in the house; they, and possibly other parts, will all be quite moist: you're gonna die! An EMT is waiting!\n\nAnd now the camera turns away from the giant stroller on the rope and focuses on the weedy pile far below her, now ablaze, like a funeral pyre for a Norse god at Ragnarok, adding an extra element of tension. But when a lone kangaroo in the crowd calls out \"MOA, MOA!\" (probably drunk on Mai-Tai's), you opine that this project has gone too far and should be put on hold. Whatever my ambition as an auteur, including such imagery in a serious film is simply low art.

It does create islands in the NW and SE, and that NW island provided another Crosslandia gift on top of the splats – the Triumphant Return.  Where you are stuck in an area, just can’t penetrate it, so you au revoir it only to return later and whoosh it in.\n\nSo, good feelings all around.  Sparked by RAGNAROK, a word that looks great to me and is fun to say, as well as by excellent clues, including [Baby sitter?] for STROLLER, and [Life partner, perhaps?] for CELLMATE.\n\nYours is a very promising new voice, Andrew, and I eagerly await more.
