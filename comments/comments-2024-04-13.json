Then, you start the same process in another section until the two sections meet, or until you can't go any farther.  Then you repeat the process.\n\nOf course, this works best if you are proficient enough to at least get somewhere each time you start an area.  But it's a good strategy, regardless of how proficient you are.\n\nThe advantage of this is that if you try to go in strict order, you're more likely to enter guesses that aren't right, and are hard to let go of...or to figure out what to let go of in the first place.  If you start with a cross of two entries with at least a 90% probability of being right, you're not likely to mess up that section.\n\nFor me, the gimme-est gimme was 50A, DOLLY PARTON.  \n\nOf course, it's also important to be willing to let go of answers you thought you were sure of.\n\nSome specifics of my solve in a separate comment.","createDate":"1712975357","updateDate":"1713184532","approveDate":"1712975359","recommendations":24,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132515974","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7373746037483215}

I thought that 5D, D.L., represented a driver's license, so I had STATE there, which meshed with 14A, Benefit, ASSET. And, of course, I'd settled on 17A, Felt hat, BERET. I was also inordinately proud of 25A, Fit for a queen?, SNUG. In short, I'd made just about *every* possible mistake that could be made in that corner. \n\nBut then, just when all looked bleak, I killed off the BERET, which allowed 4D, Taunt, GIBE, to replace my earlier choice of GEER, inspired by the meme, \"I don't often spell JEER, but when I do, I do it wrong 😀\". Then, a herd (?) of NARWHALS swam into the center, a DERBY popped up at a jaunty angle.

Those two allowed me DAH and by then, PADIDDLE was a gimme for me.  I inferred that the common song title was AVE MARIA.

Some missteps there were ELEC for ECON and EPA for DEA (DOLLY fixed that fast!)\n\nOn Jan. 27, the clue \"Org. concerned with traveling\" was NBA, so I figured that \"They don't care for icing, for short\" could be NHL.  And it was.\n\nYesterday, the LIP got a piercing.  Today, it just gets GLOSS.  (On Tuesday, it was SASS.)\n\nI thought ANGEL HAIR PASTA and capellini were the same, but apparently, the former is thinner.

It just results in a whistle and a face off at the end of the team that dumped the pick out of their zone all the way to the other end of the ice. I wanted to answer it NHLer which would be closer to someone who “cares”. \n\nI also feel that MOS being clued as personal style is a tad stretchy. Modus Operandi seems to me more a consistent way of working not an idiosyncrasy. \n\nBut overall a good puzzle.","createDate":"1713018317","updateDate":"1713437724","approveDate":"1713018319","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132520653","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5406015515327454}

Oh yeah - glad to see another new constructor. Looking forward to more from Ms. Rucks. This was a tough one for me and probably had more look-ups than I should allow, but - no big deal. Probably won't get through tomorrow anyway. \n\n*... but you ain't gonna see no unicorns (and yeah that was my first guess too - slowed me down up there). \n\nAnd... \"you ain't\" led me to my 21 letter answer find today:\n\nYOUAINTHEARDNOTHINYET\n\nIt was an answer once - in a Sunday from November 1, 1992. \n\nOh, and of course I had to look for:  RUCKSacks. That's been an answer in 3 puzzles. \n\nI'll shut up now. \n\n..","createDate":"1713006089","updateDate":"1713108290","approveDate":"1713006091","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132517760","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7633452415466309}
