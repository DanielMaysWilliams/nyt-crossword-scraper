I remember thinking that I really enjoyed the wit and warmth of the lower half and the one clue/entry I particularly liked in the upper part turned out to be hers as well. It provided excellent substantiation that every constructor has an individual, distinct and unique voice.\n\nIn this grid, however, it's as if Hall and Iverson have mind-melded, because it's very seamless and wittily clued throughout, and the doppelganger aspect (both senior editors of the two great bi-coastal newspapers, both of similar age, both parents, both seeking inspiration in the everyday moments) reinforces this feeling that it would be hard to point to whose clue/entry is whose.

I have to assume that some marine biologist, somewhere, has used this unpleasant plural, but I sure don't know one, and I know several who work with OCTOPUSES. (That's the plural we typically use in normal writing, but in some contexts, OCTOPODES or OCTOPODS  would be appropriate; but only the most annoying pedant who is trying to flex their pedantry would use those in normal speech or writing, and they're generally used to apply to the entire clade of OCTOPUSES as a group.) \n\nOh -- and in the culinary world, I believe OCTOPUS can be both singular and plural, similar to how the plural of FISH can be FISH or FISHES, depending on how many species are in the pan/catch/whatever. \n\nCome to think of it, biologists also use the same algorithm to pluralize FISH, but I don't think I've heard biologists apply it to OCTOPUS.","createDate":"1716139284","updateDate":"1719324790","approveDate":"1716139287","recommendations":8,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133318791","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8101128935813904}

Its plural is therefore \"octopodes.\" Not \"octopi\" which uses a Latin plural form (like alumnus:alumni).\n\nSo, using the most common form of creating plurals in English, namely adding an \"s\" or \"es\" is completely acceptable. How many people on this list participate in on-line forums? How many of these forum participants call them \"forae\"?\n\nEnglish usage commonly uses the \"s\" form to create plurals of foreign words, even when the word is already plural. Anyone heard somebody cringe at the word \"candelabras\"? \nWell, candelabra is already the plural of \"candelabrum,\" so it's a \"double plural.\" How about \"tortellinis\"? Or \"antennas\"? Or \"formulas\"? It should be \"formulae\" and \"antennae,\" but who ever says that?\n\nLet's let \"octopuses\" and \"octopi\" live together comfortably in the English language, at least until some pedant insists on people using the correct plural form --\"octopodes.\"","createDate":"1716147541","updateDate":"1719064710","approveDate":"1716147544","recommendations":43,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133321633","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.855743408203125}

The best that can be said for octopodes is that as a made-up plural it is more consistent with other Greek to Latin to English adaptations. Big deal. I have never once in my life heard octopodes said out loud in the wild, making it a nonstarter in my book. I‚Äôll bet that anyone who loves words enough to be here with us is familiar with the whole octopuses-octopi-octopodes conversation and perhaps bored by it. I‚Äôm more likely to use octopuses, but OCTOPI has a respectable history, appears often in print, is more fun to say, fills six squares when you have six squares to fill, and is easier to find rhymes for when composing doggerel. English is full of words and spellings based on misunderstandings, and we like it that way.
