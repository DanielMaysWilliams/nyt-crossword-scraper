Almost all foreign language clues are fairly crossed and often can be sussed out logically.  Note first and foremost, I'm not calling you out; I'm explaining a strategy to get you over the finish line next time.\n\nFor the Japanese clue, you don't have to know foreign opposites.  You just have to know what may be the one Japanese word that Anglophones know that hasn't been borrowed into English like \"karate\" and \"sushi\".  That word is HAI,meaning\"yes\", and it has an opposite. Now you know two words, HAI and \"iie\" (no).  Believe me, I didn't know the answer from the clue.  I just thought, \"What three-letter Japanese words do I know that have an opposite?\"  And I could only think of one.\n\nIf I couldn't think of any, the crosses were fair and would have helped me.\n\nThe Spanish clue might not make any sense to anyone who doesn't know any Spanish, but again, you're limited to three-letter words, and the crosses are fair.  If you can't reason the word out from the clue, you have a fair chance of getting the three crosses.\n\nIf you can't get those three crosses (in either example), you've got a bigger issue than knowing a couple of foreign words.\n\nBON VIVANT is borrowed from French, but its use as an English term is well established.  You just have to know--or figure out--that both words are pluralized in French.  BONS is apparently needed to make that area work, and is likely unavoidable.\n\nHope this helps!","createDate":"1741407824","updateDate":"1741493521","approveDate":"1741407825","recommendations":45,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140408467,"parentUserDisplayName":"Keith","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140408596","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7624740600585938}

I have another theory.\n\nWe polonize words in several basic ways:\n\nFirst, we apply our spelling to how foreign words sound to us, when it's simple enough and produces a name that looks OK in Polish. Hence Teksas, Kalifornia and Floryda.\n\nSecond, we translate stuff that can be translated, hence Nowy Jork (which combines way one with way two), and especially Północna/Południowa Karolina/Dakota.\n\nThird, we may leave alone words which have no Polish counterpart but are easy enough for us to pronounce, because your spelling makes sense in Polish, too: Alaska, Dakota.\n\nThat leaves the question: why do we *not* polonize some stuff? My theory is: some words have no Polish counterparts, and their English spelling does not lend itself to Polish rules. Take Connecticut - in Polish I would have to phonetically write that down as Konektikat, which looks really, REALLY weird. Same with Iowa - Ajoła. What is that even? It hurts my Polish eyes. So we just let things be, even though the English spelling is incompatible with Polish pronunciation.\n\nAnd maybe we stick to Georgia as the US state to avoid confusion with Gruzja, Georgia the country?","createDate":"1741444335","updateDate":"1741495582","approveDate":"1741444336","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140411733,"parentUserDisplayName":"Zbambo","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140412432","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.676017165184021}
