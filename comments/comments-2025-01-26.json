It would have been very frustrating if someone was waiting for me to finish to go out to dinner!\n\nI will say that I finished much slower (half again my Sunday average) with this one, and I'm trying to decide how much of this was circumstances, and how much it was the puzzle itself.\n\nThe only circumstance that could have been a factor was that I had taken a nap just before puzzle time and apparently slept very deeply, as I woke up kind of groggy. But I still had 15 minutes to wake up before starting, so I think that was only a slight factor.\n\nI think it was mostly the puzzle. This is a trick I've never seen before; of course, we've occasionally had picture rebuses before, but never quite this way. Not knowing how the trick worked made two crossing answers opaque, muddling whole areas until the gimmick is figured out. I also had non-theme slowdowns, especially in the NW, where it was all CLEAR AS MUD.  One thing holding me up was INCAS. I couldn'f figure out how to make BIRDSEYE fit, and after that, figured it had to be another brand.  As a Lexington Avenue resident once said, \"Who knew?\"\n\nI've said that I now solve with a sense of \"when, not if\" I'll finish, but this puzzle made me wonder if I would need to take a break, or if it would break me. In the end, it got done, and I was glad I was careful to avoid typos, because not hearing the music would have been devastating!","createDate":"1737848781","updateDate":"1737952376","approveDate":"1737848782","recommendations":15,"replyCount":13,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139262875","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-26","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5765997767448425}

I’m also pretty clueless about sports, so I thought An OUT was plausible baseball-ese. (Now that I think about it, I guess I have heard the word “fault” in association with tennis, but that still wouldn’t have got me the [TIL] abbreviation of “advantage out.”) Finally, both Ms. Radner’s surname and (post-solve) her full name ring a bell faintly, but I wasn’t alive when she was on SNL, so that ringing wasn’t any clearer than “I think it must start with a ‘G’ and end with an ‘A’”—already clear from crosses I was sure of.\n\nI was pretty certain the Latin was IDEM (after having conclusively ruled out “ibid.” from crosses), but those names and the sports term eventually had me doubting even that.

Donald got rid of it a couple days ago.

It was often identified with \"affirmative action,\" which made it a target for (mainly) white conservative politicians.

Thanks to the “See XX-Down” formulation, it was a genuine puzzle in the best sense — I was really stumped by the theme until it dawned on me with SIDESTEP/ESCAPE and was confirmed by WORKGROUP/UNIT. After that I enjoyed going back and sussing out CLEARASMUD/ARCANE, EATAWAY/ERODE and BACKSTAB/BETRAY. \n\nAlso, for whatever it’s worth, I solved without lookups as always. \n\nMy only criticism is that getting the theme depended entirely on the crosses, and many of the crosses were quite tricky IMHO. It felt unnecessarily hard … perhaps “unkind” is the word I am looking for.\n\nTo wit: \n\nAround 22A/19D you have the egregious EARCLIP. Used as a standalone noun, “earclip” almost always refers to an earring. Its use in electronics is typically as a modifier to describe a type of earbud, e.g., “ear clip wireless earbuds.” In the same region you have the dubious ASU (only correct if you include all campuses in the county), the unusual ARDENCY and the fun-but-esoteric INCAS. \n\n42A/46D: A random podcast host (ALAINA), the questionable SLAT (cf others) and the only-since-2011 NO BRA DAY, and that’s not counting ELENA and KIR. \n\n64A/67D: Four names (MEGAN, MIRREN, ARLO, ANA) plus the unusual KNURL. \n\nEven 98A/101D needed GILDA and ROSSELLINI and 111A/107D involved NERDY, THREAD and MATEYS, all fair but not gimmes. \n\nNot the end of the world.

The theme really was cute and clever. I found some of the crosses more difficult for me than usual on a Sunday. Usually I don't mind that at all because I consider it a skill building opportunity. Today I was a little more frustrated with it... But honestly, that's all on me, not the puzzle. \n\nI recognize that how I feel physically or mentally at any given puzzle time does affect my attitude about it. I've been dealing with some pain issues that really ramped up today and I know that impacted my experience and leaves me a little bit more meh, which I don't really think is fair to the puzzle. So I will focus on the parts that really made me smile through not feeling so good.\n\nThough it felts more difficult, I managed to get through without any lookups in a bit under my Sunday average. I like rebuses of all kinds, so this was a fun change. And I'm a really big fan of all the circled letters spelling out rebuses. That is a lovely brandy soaked cherry on top! \n\nAlso, I really loved the clue at 18A for MADEATOAST!  Looks like there was a similar usage in 2021, which was before my puzzle solving time, but it definitely made me smile. \n\nAnd I definitely loved being had by the seemingly so straightforward clue at 105A for ORDERED. I find being had for a while by a clue to be very fun when I get the aha moment.\n\nAnyhow, that's it from me for anyone who's still reading comments.

If the answer is only correct on a technicality that requires using a county boundary rather than a single campus, that’s a sign to me that it should be clued differently.  \n\nEspecially when one of the crosses (INCAS) is tricky — I enjoyed learning that but presumably it is not a widely known fact. And ITALIC and NOSILY were also on the unusual/tricky side. \n\nI’ll have more to say elsewhere but I thought the fill was generally trickier/more obscure than it needed to be for what was also a tricky theme. I would have liked to see kinder/gentler editing on this one.","createDate":"1737899702","updateDate":"1737929915","approveDate":"1737899703","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139267827,"parentUserDisplayName":"John","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139268335","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7703334093093872}
