Sometimes it is, sometimes it's...close. \n\nAgree with the two Sams on this puzzle, that it's very smooth and lyrical, and the grid design is pleasing. I hope to see more from Mr. Locke, and it's interesting to me that a career in a stressful field like firefighting didn't deter his son from an equally stressful career. I'd like to think that he must have admired his father's courage and commitment and found them qualities worth emulating. Of course, that's not how life works, not as a rule. Right emus? \n\nFunnily, I was just listening to Wilco's \"Yankee Foxtrot Hotel\" and was astonished to see WILCO in this puzzle.

But it has sent me down this morning's etymological rabbit-hole.\n\"Hues and cry\" falls under the English linguistic category of \"legal doublet\"--a stock idiom which consists of two (occasionally three) words which are basically synonyms. Often, one is of Anglo-Saxon origin, the other of (Norman) French--i.e. \"Last will and testament\"--the idea being that if you didn't understand one, you'd understand the other; although both \"hue\" and \"cry\" are both French. In fact, the first couple citations from the OED, from c., are both from Anglo-Norman French texts. And forget all that nonsense about \"Huesium et clamor\"--that is simply a back-translation into contemporary (13th c.) Latin of a phrase that had already existed in French and English. In other words, you're not going to find the word \"huesium\" in Cicero.","createDate":"1714394822","updateDate":"1714438868","approveDate":"1714394825","recommendations":10,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132868808","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-29","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4803731143474579}

If you're getting gold stars, but they are not being added to your streak, I'd think it's a technical issue and I'd email them at address given at the top of the comment section.\n\n(*There is some discussion on how late a puzzle can be done and still have it count towards your streak. I often do the puzzle late at night or even the next morning without issue, but a pause of more than day has broken my streak.)","createDate":"1714453744","updateDate":"1714531298","approveDate":"1714453746","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132889687,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shannabanana","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132891229","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7034658193588257}
