Then the puzzle title led us to debate the colorful grid until we had a strategy for solving for the theme.  After some experimentation with the crosses, we deduced that there was an easy way and a hard way to go about this.  We found that all the colorful across entries were going to require extra brain power, even as it became clear what was going on here.  However, if this becomes too taxing to deal with, we could always default to just solving all the down entries we could.  The downs seemed to provide smooth sailing.\nAt a certain point, we decided to see how far we could get doing only the across entries (yes, we enjoy debating that kind of headache).  Then we realized that every colorful puzzle entry would solve to both a solution to the provided clue and another completely different, but reasonable crossword entry if the 'color' is ignored.  We very much appreciate puzzles that provide some method of \"cross checking\" your entries.\nIsn't this what crossword puzzles are all about?\nBy the time we got to 113A we were ready to applaud Adam Wagner,\n\nThank you!","createDate":"1740873312","updateDate":"1741003908","approveDate":"1740873313","recommendations":39,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140225487","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8441594839096069}

If I hadn't caught on because of that specifically, or if color words were all the same length, I probably would have tried to rebus it myself.

Biv:\n\nThe rainbow spectrum is, of course, a continuum. The seven traditional colors originate with Isaac Newton's *Opticks* (1704--first published in English, then translated to Latin, which was the opposite order for scientific treatises of the day). Why seven? There had to be: seven days of the week, seven (astrological) planets, seven tones of the (diatonic) musical scale. Hence the rather artificial distinction between \"indigo\" and \"violet.\"\n\nThis goes against the Berlin-Kay Basic Color Terms of English, which distinguished \"pink\" from \"red,\" but lumps \"indigo\" and \"violet\" into \"purple.\" Of course, Berlin and Kay didn't formulate their psycho-linguistic theories until 250 years later, but it explains why we, English-speakers, easily distinguish between \"yellow\" from \"orange,\" but not \"indigo\" from \"violet.\" \n\nLuckily, all of this was cleared up in 1979 with the redesign of the gay Rainbow Flag. (Which originally had *eight* colors--each of which carried a symbolic meaning!):\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBTQ)#History\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBTQ)#History</a>","createDate":"1740921349","updateDate":"1740961290","approveDate":"1740921351","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140229559,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bill","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140229676","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9110258221626282}

I myself was unsure of a few answers being right or not but at the end I sorta decided they were *probably* right and that maybe the problem was the exact format of entry, so I opted to finally delete my rebus-style 'extra letters' from the rainbow-adjacent squares and let those letters/words be covered from \"inside the lines\". When that didn't get the 'Congrats' page either, I found a recently-spawned typo (\"'USePEN'?! How'd that 'e' get in there, it was 'O' a few minutes ago?!\") and got it. I didn't mind too much cuz I know sometimes the puzzles are fussy as to EXACTLY how one enters stuff, but I understand i_w's point, and didn't read their comment as some kind of \"I don't wanna hafta puzzle out the puzzle type\" comment at all.\n\n1,000 points to the constructor for cluing 76A as the wonderful, wonderful EMO Philips instead of using the old standby \"genre of music\" clue.","createDate":"1740955405","updateDate":"1740958868","approveDate":"1740958868","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140241123,"parentUserDisplayName":"i w","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140242307","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7518853545188904}
