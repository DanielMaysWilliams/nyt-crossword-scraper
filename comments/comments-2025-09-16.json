I first had the dish on holiday in the Tatra mountains, when I was 4 or 5. It was great.\n\nLiver, either chicken or veal, is also very popular, fried in light batter. I had it often as a child, as did many of my friends.\n\nThen there are regional dishes, like czernina (literally something like \"the black thing\") of Wielkopolska, in the West of the country. It's a soup made with duck stock, ducks' blood and cherries. Yep, you read that right. I love it. My mother-in-law makes killer czernina.\n\nI also enjoy offal all over Europe. Especially memorable were: beef heart in Czechia, deep fried spleen sandwich on Sicily, and sweetbread in France (what is it about offal having strange names in English?

Just because the editors use outside sources to make the puzzles doesn’t mean that the editors don’t have an opinion on words which are in a submission or the topic.  And to that end seeing the same word a few days apart doesn’t seem like an accident at all.  Of course there could be randomness to it…but there can also be some flavor of choice or bias by the editing team.\n\nI remember a crossword event Will Shortz hosted…there were a number of puzzles presented to be solved…Those were all going to be published at a future date in the times.  There was even one containing a wedding proposal which was then made in person at the event. That puzzle was published in the Times a while later too.\n\nAnd let’s not forget every holiday or birthday theme a puzzle may have.\n\nThe editors put a lot of consideration into what a puzzle contains and plan pretty far into the future for publication.
