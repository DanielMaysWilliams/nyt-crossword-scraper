Also, a traditional way of measuring the ingredients is to put the eggs you are planning to use on one side of a (balance) scale, and weigh the other three ingredients to match.\n\nThe recipe I use is pretty much that standard, but I've tweaked the ratio of sugar to flour (7:6) to reflect contemporary American tastes. Also, I put a little leavening in.\n\nBILL'S DETROIT-STYLE POUND CAKE:\n\n6.5 oz. unsalted butter\n7 oz. sugar\n3/8 tsp.

A.P. flour\n1 tsp. baking powder\n\nIn a stand mixer, cream butter with sugar, salt, and flavorings until light and fluffy. Meanwhile, sift together flour and baking powder. Add about half the egg mixture to the butter, then stir in the flour, then the rest of the eggs. Mix just until incorporated.\n\nPut the batter into to a greased and floured loaf pan. Bake in a low-medium oven (325° or so) until a tester comes out clean.\n\nWould now be a good time to serve it with some grilled peaches and some whipped mascarpone?\n\n*Chef's tip--if using zest, grind it with the sugar for a few seconds in a food processor, to release the aromatic oils.\n\n(Hi, @MOL, and @ Heidi!)","createDate":"1755542601","updateDate":"1755576157","approveDate":"1755542602","recommendations":15,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144361599","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8570076823234558}
