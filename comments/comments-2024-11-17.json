Sometimes I get to the end of a long puzzle and it says that something‚Äôs wrong. 99% of the time I typoed something (usually my big fingers hitting the wrong letter while retyping an answer that‚Äôs been confirmed in pen instead of pencil) and it‚Äôs annoying to have to hunt that down. \n\nAlternately, I‚Äôd love if we could just pick an answer and mark it to be pen instead of pencil without having to retype it. That would solve most of my problems.","createDate":"1731853538","updateDate":"1731864200","approveDate":"1731853541","recommendations":2,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137675798","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-17","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7912936210632324}

I plugged that answer in immediately, on my first go through. And it may have been my favorite in the puzzle for nostalgia reasons.\n\nA quick Google brought up a whole lot of macaroni art pictures and ideas that are a whole lot fancier than any I did back in the day.  \n\nAnyhow, I am very tired from our weekend but I will second and third all of the comments about AWOL and mia. I have no personal experience with anyone MIA nor have I military experience but that just rubbed me at the wrong way and I resisted putting it in until I had no choice. I understand that things take on new, sometimes watered down, meanings, but I think some things should be held sacred and I would argue that this is one of them.\n\nOtherwise a fun and charming puzzle after a fun but relatively brutal Saturday.

I went to play your linked puzzle and was immediately hit with 3 clues in the top left corner that felt like obscure trivia to *me*. I don‚Äôt know generals, French physicists, or what BPOE stands for. If I committed to the whole puzzle, I‚Äôd hope I could start filling in crosses and figure them out.\n\nIn nearly every puzzle the Times publishes, I see a comment along these lines. Might some trivia deemed ‚Äúobscure‚Äù for you be common knowledge for another?\n\nI expect crossword puzzle clues to change as time passes. When I started to do the puzzle in your link, I struggled with the clues more than I do with current puzzles. Likely because I am a different age or of different cultural experience than you. Or a byproduct of two puzzles created at different times.\n\nI checked this Sunday‚Äôs puzzle again after seeing a few comments along your lines. There were a few names or trivia that I also did not know, but I figured them out via crossing words and some educated guesses for spellings. For example, when I had STE_IE, I thought a W made the most sense. Obscur for me, but now I know something new about a sport rising in popularity (women‚Äôs basketball).\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I am relatively new to crosswords. Maybe there‚Äôll come a day when I find the clueing annoying or too niche.

The only common exceptions are themers that would make nonsense outside of the puzzle, without a revealer.  As a regular at the local pub trivia nights, I resent that \"trivia\" is used to disparage entries that, frankly, are just too difficult for a small but annoying subset of the commentariat. I very much doubt that they would do well at any pub trivia contests. I hope we don't dumb the puzzles down to accommodate their incessant ululations about clues that are beyond their ken.","createDate":"1731889624","updateDate":"1731915615","approveDate":"1731889628","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137686393,"parentUserDisplayName":"Barry Ancona","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137687307","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-17","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5549774765968323}

This goes way back, at least for the NYT. Asymmetrical grids in those publications are rare, but if the theme justifies the asymmetry, it‚Äôs allowed. \n\nI don‚Äôt really know why symmetry is usually a requirement. A symmetrical grid does make it easier for solvers to identify theme answers. But a lot of good theme ideas have died because the constructor couldn‚Äôt find a symmetrical set of theme answers.","createDate":"1731911693","updateDate":"1731911696","approveDate":"1731911696","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137687843,"parentUserDisplayName":"Josh","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137689531","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8427125215530396}
