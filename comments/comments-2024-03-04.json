The solve might have been even longer if I hadn't been doing my puzzles on other media when the NYT web interface came out (Puzzazz was an app that worked for the NYT puzzles way back then, and never was unable to handle an oddball theme; Across Lite was my go-to before that), but 3000 puzzles ago was when I started in the NYT interface, and so it's a 3000-day streak today.  (What I'm saying is that I was already doing them without lookups before the streak started, but I don't have documentation for how long.)\n\nI have been solving for over 40 years.  If you can't imagine doing 3000 puzzles in a row without help, keep in mind that these days, with all the resources that exist that didn't when I was starting out, you can become good much faster than when I was new to this.\n\nMy solves are rather fast these days because that's my natural pace now.

However, Nowak is the most common surname in Poland. It is the equivalent of the English name Newman. \"Nowy\" means \"new\" in Polish, and -ak is a traditional ending of names that derive from everyday words, akin to the better known and more common -ski/-ska (for another example of a name ending with -ak: Marczak is a surname relating to the month of March, marzec in Polish). Interestingly, all Polish common nouns and most proper names are gendered (st√≥≈Ç - table - is a boy, in a way, and szabla - saber - is a girl, while ≈Ç√≥≈ºko - bed - is neutral). The -ak names, like Nowak, are no longer subject to this rule, but they used to be. In the past, Nowak√≥wna was the daughter of a man called Nowak, and his wife was Nowakowa. This tradition was only phased out in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe second most common surname in Poland is Kowalski/Kowalska (Smith): Kowalski would be a man and Kowalska a woman. Can you imagine how hard it is to introduce gender-neutral language into Polish? Some efforts are being made, and rightly so, but it is much harder than in English.\n\nOne of the ways to recognize somebody is American-Polish is by their name, because in English the Polish surnames drop the female gendering (all American Polish names keep the male form - how about that for misogyny?). You would never be called Maria (Mary) Kowalski in Polish - it would always be Maria Kowalska.","createDate":"1709532634","updateDate":"1709707452","approveDate":"1709532636","recommendations":28,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131594309","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8622145652770996}
