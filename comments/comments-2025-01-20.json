It’s always interesting to discover how others rate the puzzle in terms of difficulty. Although many found this one tough for a Monday, for me it was below my average Monday time— and might even have been a PB had it not been for an unusual number of fat finger flubs. When I looked it over, though, I would have expected a Monday to be kinder to the international solvers; seemed like quite a few U.S.-centric entries, which I would have thought would be minimized on a Monday. \n\nI think the perception of difficulty might also have been influenced by the fact that this puzzle may have favored female solvers. There were two questions on hairstyles (that referred to mostly feminine styles) and one on makeup, as well as a question about a doll. Absolutely NOT saying males don’t/shouldn’t play with dolls or wear makeup— or be familiar with women’s hairstyles (if there is such a distinction!)— just that fewer men are likely to find these topics in their wheelhouse.","createDate":"1737356982","updateDate":"1737395746","approveDate":"1737356983","recommendations":12,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139117202","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5268117189407349}

WYETH crossing at 1A. The N was the artist's first initial, and as such, completely uninferrable in any way, while in the other direction, it could have been practically any letter.  And not knowing either one would lead to being totally stuck.  Being at 1A, there was less surrounding context to help out than usual.\n\nHaving traveled the Mass Pike a few times in my life, I knew NATICK.  But I didn't know N.C.

And I'd also forgive you for not knowing who stars in Shark Tank.  (I didn't.)\n\nBut at the cross, you're left with the letter missing in U_TA and O_EARY.  \n\nOverseas solvers, you're excused if you didn't see O'LEARY immediately, but it's a really common name here.  But the rest of you should have, really.\n\nI grant you that it's not as obvious what goes in the other direction, but the L looks good because it reminds one of \"ultimate.\"\n\nI submit that the real reason people got upset about this crossing is that they didn't have most of the surrounding words, most of which seemed pretty easy to me.
