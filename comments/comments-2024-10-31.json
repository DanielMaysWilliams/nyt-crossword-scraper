But no, no rebus in this one (stop that unkind snorting!) and the grid almost entirely filled if you ignore the strange nonwords I didn't know what to do with.  Then the shoe dropped and the first rebus was unmasked.  So. There will be more.  Got another one and then a third, and the puzzle stopped looking so goofy.  Went cold in the southeast. I knew there was a rebus there on the same line as the one across the way, knew it would be something scary, but didn't, couldn't, get past Mongolian and think of it even though it is one of my favorite OGRE DEMON TROLL types. Sighed and came to the column, fingers crossed, and here it was: GOLEM!

OkDONT seemed reasonable, and the fact I had not heard of the dating app HEk did not phase me.  But OBVS HER makes so much better sense.  \n\nI spent most of my time trying to make the rebus work in the cell where HORS_ crossed TEAT_Y since CRESCENT seemed to be a perfectly fine answer.  The thing is, if it wasn't for the rebus first letter rule I never would have gotten credit for this puzzle.  I figured that the letter following HORS_ had to be an E, I just couldn't figure out what string of letters beginning with E satisfied the clue for 26A and 13D.  But I left the E there, and went looking elsewhere for an error I had missed.  When I changed HEk to HER I got the gold star. \nSo if there is an argument for not allowing the first letter only of a rebus square, this puzzle would be it - because I imagined the rebus to be in the wrong square.

Your situation is just that you had three of them written out in full, but not the fourth. \n\nMore than likely, it was the last square you entered. If that’s what happened, the software registered the win as soon as you entered the first letter. If you want to have all the rebuses displayed properly at the end of the solve, just leave a different square blank before you enter the rebus. \n\nI assume the software accepts just one letter for the sake of those who can’t figure out how to enter multiple letters, or perhaps it’s a holdover from a time when there was no way to enter multiple letters into one space.","createDate":"1730345839","updateDate":"1730419276","approveDate":"1730345841","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137242699,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mark","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137242985","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8311083316802979}

Of course Star Wars.\n\nFor me, there were several clues for which I did not know the answer outright, but I could figure it out with crosses and logic.

Your situation is just that you had three of them written out in full, but not the fourth. \n\nMore than likely, it was the last square you entered. If that’s what happened, the software registered the win as soon as you entered the first letter. If you want to have all the rebuses displayed properly at the end of the solve, just leave a different square blank before you enter the rebus. \n\nI assume the software accepts just one letter for the sake of those who can’t figure out how to enter multiple letters, or perhaps it’s a holdover from a time when there was no way to enter multiple letters into one space.","createDate":"1730373694","updateDate":"1730389059","approveDate":"1730373697","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137245691,"parentUserDisplayName":"OR Duck","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137245867","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8925763964653015}
