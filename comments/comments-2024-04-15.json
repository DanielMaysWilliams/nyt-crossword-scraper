They divided the map according to the twelve houses of the zodiac so that each temple and each neighborhood would receive the proper influence of the favoring constellations; they fixed the point in the walls where gates should be cut, foreseeing how each would frame and eclipse of the moon in the next thousand years. Perinthia -- they guaranteed -- would reflect the harmony of the firmament; nature's reason and the gods' benevolence would shape the inhabitants' destinies.\n\nFollowing the astronomers' calculations precisely, Perinthia was constructed; various peoples came to populate it; the first generation born in Perinthia began to grow within its walls; and these citizens reached the age to marry and have children.\n\nIn Perinthia's streets and square today you enter cripples, dwarfs, hunchbacks, obese men, bearded women.

He was like, what!? And I said \"An epee, man! An epee!\" He said, \"Uh, I guess I need to see the it better... \" And I said, \"I don't, it's an epee!\" \n\nWhat I lacked in actual knowledge, I more than made up for in jesting confidence. As the murder case went on, it was indeed an antique epee. My husband, as is often unreasonably the case, was incredibly impressed with my brilliance. I in my usual fashion did some ridiculous version of a touchdown dance. Life is hard, but good!\n\nI did then confess that the only reason I know of the existence of epees is from my new journey into crosswords.
