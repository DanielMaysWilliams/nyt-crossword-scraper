I started doing the NYT crossword with a few friends at lunchtime in high school back in the 1970s when Eugene T Maleska was the editor. Kids, in the olden days the crossword didn’t gradually get harder throughout the week (that was one of the best later innovations by Will Shortz), so you never knew what you were going to get. And you had to wait until the next day to check your work (no happy music). Throughout my working career, I would do the puzzle with small groups of colleagues. I am a social solver who really enjoys the interaction and conversation that crossword solving elicits. Now that I am retired it’s just me and my wife doing the puzzle together every evening.
