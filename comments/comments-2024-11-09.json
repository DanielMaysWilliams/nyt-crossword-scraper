I tend to avoid the really serious stuff (so French New Wave is a no-no: I have only encountered Agnes Varda in these puzzles), but I also dislike most of the popular, mainstream films and series - I can't stand superhero movies, Game of Thrones etc. \n\nAs for sports... I can tell you the names and describe the strengths and weaknesses of the top 50 or 60 climbers in the climbing world cup, female and male, or discuss at length the rhythm dance styles of the past few figure skating seasons (Chock and Bates are so ridiculously good! I could spend my whole life watching them perform). But baseball, basketball and football are all huge mysteries to me, and ones I don't care about at all. I only know a few things about soccer because my wife is a fan.\n\nI failed today because of who I am, not because the puzzle was bad.

One of the first things we had to do, on the outskirts of Boston, was get the gas tank filled. Needless to say, unused to navigating that height and width, we cut it too close rounding the island for an open pump, scraping the side of the truck and (slightly) damaging the safety bumper at the end of the island. We decided the best thing to do was get out of there, quick! \n\nI have a feeling I've forgotten the details of why our getaway was so imperative. (It was many, many years ago.)
