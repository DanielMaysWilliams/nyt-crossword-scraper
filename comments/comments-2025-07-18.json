Wizer - just for the interest of any few who are interested. I don’t dare say more, lest I spoil it for the keeners - look it up, or do it yourself :)\n\n****\n\nHi.\nI just completed this puzzle (with a few reveals - it was brutally hard!) in the NYT archives using their app, and there are mistakes in the cluing in that version - but what is odd is that there are different (but related) mistakes or at least oddities in the same clue group here at xwordinfo.\n\nIt all revolves around the word loops. Here at xwordinfo.com, the four “down” strings in those loops do not have numbers to start their “words”. Specifically, there are no numbered squares or clues for the numbers 30, 45, 90, and 105. Perhaps this is an editorial decision on your part for this very odd puzzle. Fine. But that is not addressed in the verbiage or analysis.\n\nIn the NYT archives version accessible via the Games app, the squares are all conventionally numbered and clued. The error there is that the wording of two of the “down” clues are incorrect, referencing 42 Across rather than 43 Across. I will let them know about that. I do not have access to the newspaper archives to see what was done there - perhaps you at xwordinfo are following the original paper format?\n\nAnyway - I appreciate your site.

Hard to say whether it was sloppiness, though, or done on purpose. Folks study Greek and Roman mythology less and less and, unfortunately, I’ve seen translations that mix up Greek and Latin names. Even Pope is guilty of referring both to Minerva and Athena in his translation of the Odyssey. \n\nIf I’m telling a story at a party *not* full of academics, I might refer to both Hercules and Athena. I’d say that for every 5 people who know who Hercules and Athena are, only one person will now Heracles and Minerva. \n\nA few years ago I might have been surprised at the editors’ mixing up a Greek and Roman reference.

I think I have to go to the doctor though. I'm feeling much worse than during a regular cold.\n\n@SP\n\nWhen the eras and civ switching were announced before C7's release I was shocked and horrified. I have played all civ games since the early 90s, and I always did it for immersion: to build a (single) culture to last six millenia. I was worried the civ switches would take away all of my fun. Well, the system works surprisingly well, in practice. My wife and I both like it.\n\nThere are some issues though. The ancient and exploration eras are great - the modern one feels like a chore though. I was ok with it for some 300 hours (as in, for 300 hours of game after game in all three eras), but then something snapped in me and I can no longer finish the game in the modern era. I know I will win - it's just that getting there is not fun. There are rumors the developers may allow skipping eras in a future update. I would love that.\n\nStill, if you're not too different from my wife and I, you should get your money's worth from Civ 7.\n\nGraphics are great (8/10, IMO), the music, too. Gameplay is 10/10 in the ancient era 8/10 in the exploration era, and 5/10 tops in the modern era. There is a wide range of civs and leaders to choose from.

Of course, you can consider stropping to be a part of the overall sharpening process. \n\nStrop blocks are used for honing things like plane blades, chisels, and the like. I can't imagine what it would be like to strop the blade of a plane on a belt! You need a relatively rigid and FLAT stropping surface for this task. \n\nGood for you for being open to learning things you don't already know. That's one of the things I like about crosswords (and the column!), learning new stuff. So many people seem to dislike learning new things.
