Here, KOS is easily recognized alongside the full word \"knockouts\"; in fact, it's often spelled \"kayos\".  Also, and more importantly, if the abbreviation is read out as written, the abbr. marker isn't needed.  That doesn't mean that they couldn't be provided anyway, but the only time they are actually required is when they're not pronounced as they are abbreviated (e.g. BDRM), and they are not usually used as the common version of the item in question.\n\nSo, some of the recent answers that have taken the abbr. marker are BDRM, ANON(ymous), PSI for tire inflation, AMT (amount), MASC(uline), ELEC(tric), MTN for mountain, etc.  But you'll also see UAE, a common shortening akin to USA or UK, and MASS, which is one of the few states whose abbreviation is read as a word (as if it were what grams measure).  So it's up to the discretion of the editor to include the marker in the latter case.","createDate":"1739849026","updateDate":"1739910098","approveDate":"1739849027","recommendations":5,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139871761","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8282833695411682}

All hail Barry Ancona for his long service to his wordplaying constituents. Seriously!\n\nI'm of mixed feelings about this puzzle, and not least because [Identity thieves' targets for short] precisely describes the crew currently infesting Treasury and now coming after our SSNS. No, it wasn't the triggered mourning for my lost future means of support, although that weighs heavily on me, it was the lacklustre cluing of the top tiers (and some areas beneath) which so jarred with the brilliance of the theme set. Examples? [Got 100% on]--ACED. I see the name Agar I expect better, \"mustered\" level cluing throughout. Instead it's [____Major (bear constellation)] -- SRSLY?\n\nBut on the plus side, great to see two black and white sea creatures, the swans and the orca (which also had a pedestrian clue), and a third, Nessie, who changes color with each sighting. I'd hazard she's puce. \n\nLoved Head Dancer. Made me cringe, remembering once in my young adulthood suggesting a pow-wow to a woman who turned out to be part-Seneca and who took deep offense, and that's the last time I ever used that expression, even though I can't remember what exactly I was proposing, but I was likely hoping for some canoodling.

Also, Polish language and culture very rarely use our word for \"love\" (\"miłość\" as a noun and \"kochać\" as a verb) for anything else than the strongest familial or romantic feelings towards other people. Your \"like\" is our \"lubić\", and it is most commonly used to describe stuff we find nice but not super-nice. \"Uwielbiać\" is probably our closest verb to your \"love\" as applied to things or concepts rather than people.
