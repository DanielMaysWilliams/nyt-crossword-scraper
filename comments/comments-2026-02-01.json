Help me gamers—LIFEBAR? Is that really a thing? I’ve always called it a HEALTHBAR. AMNESIA for “never mind”? Just…off.

In this case, the parentheses “nest” clues inside each other, and the same is true with the answers (such as (TI(ME(MACH)IN)ES), or TIME MACHINES). Deb Amlen: “Did your brain, like my own, immediately shut down as soon as you opened Sam Brody’s puzzle? How about your heart? Did it pound as you tried to figure out what was up with all the parentheses in the clues?” But as she concluded, “As strange as the clues look, they are admirably consistent, or what constructors call a ‘tight’ theme set. As a whole, today’s puzzle is a great demonstration of how constructors think: They tend to notice patterns in language.”","createDate":"1769902372","updateDate":"1770009962","approveDate":"1769902372","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148536862,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eric Hougland","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148537044","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7455809712409973}

Its showpiece is the quadruple stack of full-length entries in its center. It looks like a beast to solve, and indeed there are many areas where a solver needs tenacity and mental flexibility to move forward, but it’s very fair. … I think this puzzle is great for anyone who rises to the challenge — a puzzle that’s intimidating but doable and that makes you feel accomplished in the end.  …[I]t’s high art for a constructor to be able to combine so many imposing elements into a harmonious solve. (Caitlin Lovinger)\n\nRunner-Up October 24 (Kelvin Zhou) —[Mr. Zhou’s] grid is quite good. [It] even introduces us to seven debut entries. The solving just required a substantial tug of war between my brain and Mr.Zhou’s. … The experience perfectly demonstrates what I like to think of as the cruciverbal version of a popular idiom: some days you get the puzzle, and some days the puzzle gets you. … There’s some greatness in Mr. Zhou’s puzzle and you won’t want to miss it.
