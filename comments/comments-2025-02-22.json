I have to guess that, since games subscriptions are now the biggest revenue generator for the NYT, they have chosen to lower the difficulty level to maintain subscribers, but it's a bummer for those of us who are puzzle masochists. They just rarely scratch the itch anymore. These days, when there is the rare puzzle that's  challenging, the message board is on fire with complaints about \"gimmicks\" and such. To each their own, but I can't help being disappointed that Saturdays are often what I think of as Wednesday level difficulty.

I had no idea how different human hair could be, and what practical consequences those differences have. Thank you!\n\nWith the Iron Curtain cutting us off from the rest of the world, in my formative years almost everybody in Poland was white: the only non-white people I ever saw were the students at Warsaw's agricultural university, located a short walk from where we lived. They only came here from Africa or Asia to study and then usually moved on, so I had no real opportunity to learn anything about them from them.\n\nIn the past 35 years with democracy and market economy encouraging mobility, our population has become much more diverse. For example, many of my students at university are children of industrious Asian people who came to Poland in the 1990s to take advantage of rapid economic growth. There are great pictures from that era, like this one of a dapper Asian businessman at Warsaw's biggest 1990s bazaar: <a href=\"https://www.vogue.pl/uploads/repository/01_susy_menkes/krzysztof-miller.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.vogue.pl/uploads/repository/01_susy_menkes/krzysztof-miller.jpg</a> (in the 90s Warsaw's communist-era national stadium was effectively abandonned, and a huge marketplace took over the building and its environs.
