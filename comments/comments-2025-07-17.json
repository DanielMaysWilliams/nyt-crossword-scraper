I think it was $2k apiece.\n\nWe chose the trip, of course, and it was fantastic! The famous landmarks but also the people. Met a couple of  Russian med students and hung out with them while they pointed out the KGB cars. Drank homemade bathtub cherry vodka in the apartment of a refusnik pediatrician and got her some groceries at the tourist shop she wasn't allowed to enter. Learned not to speak Russian in the Lithuanian shops. Took a bus through the Caucasus mtns driven by a man drunk on grappa-- gorgeous and terrifying! I am sad for the Russian people suffering under Putin, the ones who oppose him.\n\nI got my wedding dress at the mall for $80, my dad took our photos, and we had cake with a few friends-- just fine.

What I do find irksome, however, are the speed solvers who feel compelled to post their (to me) absurdly fast solve times. I have always been a slow‚Äìand‚Äìsteady type solver, and have reconciled myself to the realization that I could never complete a puzzle in those times. But while I certainly am impressed that some folks can, and accept that it is fine if that is what gives them pleasure, posting those numbers in what is not specifically a competitive venue strikes me as unnecessary and unbecoming braggadocio. \n\nI got quite a bit of pushback the last time I posted these sentiments, so let me be clear: I can respect tournament‚Äìtype solvers‚Ä¶ but in these daily puzzles, the only prize offered is one‚Äôs own satisfaction.

I seem to have  gotten rid of my ridiculous name by logging out of the Apple Game Center. Now I just get prompted to log in to the Game Center on first opening the NYT Games app and I don‚Äôt see that weird name any more.  And now in Apple Game Center settings it seems to be giving me the option to set up an account again under my own ID. I am undecided about this for now. I hope that it will not become mandatory to participate in the Game Center to use the NYT app.  I suspect it WILL be necessary to do so in the future, however, if you want to participate in new exciting social features (/s) they may be planning (like group solve, for instance). But this is mere speculation on my part. It‚Äôs all I can do until the app team decides to tell us why these changes have been made. \n\nI suspect the NYT games team decided it would be a good idea to integrate the Games app with the iOS  Game Center because it facilitates all that social sharing nonsense without having to re-invent the wheel.
