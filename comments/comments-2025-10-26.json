The top half went a little fast but got more interesting as I went down. I liked the KENDOLL clue and the cross of ENVY and AVARICE—I wish they had tied those together more. Had a laugh at the clue for AMBIGUITY. Wondering if anyone else but HeathieJ and I (see comments below) really got the willies from the SNACKCOUNTER clue? I am usually the last person to get all PC and feel like something is inappropriate, but this one seemed in bad taste even to me. If it was a really great clue or the only possible option, then maybe,  but it seemed kind of meh. And in the meantime, although of course “snacks” is a legitimate slang term for “hotties”, and some people talk that way, do we need to be reminded of it? The clue came off to me as trivializing or normalizing it.

And now, SNACK for people we find romantically attractive.\n\nTo me, referring to someone as a snack isn't necessarily objectifying *them* (although it could be) but more a way to describe the way *you* feel around them... the way your neurological system responds. That said, it's clear from the comments that not everyone has those feelings, or at least y'all have more self-control than I do.\n\nAnd now, I need to go break into the bag of Halloween candy I was saving for the 31st.\n\nNOM.","createDate":"1761501164","updateDate":"1761544865","approveDate":"1761501166","recommendations":12,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146210890","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6350353360176086}

If the majority see this as really just a synonym for hottie and does not have the connotation of being demeaning, then I withdraw my objection.

It’s just to me a snack is something you eat just because it tastes good briefly (and probably not good for you) while a meal would be something that has lasting nutritional value.

No I don’t have the same visceral reaction to “eye candy” for some reason, which is inconsistent. It’s equally demeaning as “snack” and also has the connotation of using them only for their sexual attractiveness. The only difference is that I see the former as mainly for looking at and the latter for carnal purposes. But that probably comes from being from my generation and getting used to the term. I suspect that people saying “snack” think of it exactly the same way. So, everyone, although I won’t be using the term any time soon I officially withdraw my objection as to its appropriateness.
