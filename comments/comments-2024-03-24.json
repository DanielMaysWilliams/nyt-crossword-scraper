Not sure where Caitlin was going in the gameplay column with her explanation of how to read \"fudge's facts\" -- like “I am delicious” or “You deserve a little nibble of me, go on\" -- but maybe I'm too tired to get her quips; I just thought the ingredients of fudge, that is, the FACTS about fudge, include sugar and cocoa.

It was actually harder for me than yesterday's puzzle - themes such as today's are extremely cryptic to me, and on top of that most of the trivia was US-centric (which is fine, given this is a US crossword, but objectively fine can subjectively feel not so).\n\nThe clue for UMPS I still don't understand, even after checking the meaning of \"homebodies\". I know what an ump is, but I don't see a connection with the clue. The clue for STRIPES mystified me - but it was explained in the column.\n\nISUZU finally came to me, just as I was about to google it - it is a pretty niche brand in Poland, best known for failure-prone diesel engines in their horribly ugly pick-up trucks. Pick-ups are not very popular in Poland, and Toyota, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and several other auto makers offer much better ones than Isuzu.\n\nOver here vans are much more common than pick-ups as utility vehicles in small business and agriculture, and many people just hitch trailers to their regular cars - or tractors, in the countryside - because it's cheaper than getting a specialized vehicle. When I was a child in the 80s, horse-drawn carts were still a staple of Polish agricultural transport, but I can't remember when I last saw one of those. It must have been the early 90s.\n\nI am also glad to have remembered GIL Scott Heron from a feature in The Guardian - I actually don't know any of his work, but his name is lodged in my mind.","createDate":"1711263879","updateDate":"1711402182","approveDate":"1711263881","recommendations":26,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132055196","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-24","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5609048008918762}

A bit of a mixed bag for me. Never quite felt on John’s wavelength, but that’s neither here nor there. I also like a Sunday that really flows, and somehow the grid construction of this one prevented that — the corners felt unusually (for a Sunday) cut off from the rest of the grid.

I don’t think it works, because “AT EASE” is not a noun — so it can’t be possessed. Sorry, but it really doesn’t work. It is an adjectival phrase. And it was material, because once I had “SETS…” I saw the possibility of “…ATEASE” but resisted it on the basis that it didn’t fit the pattern. \n\nI think this may be what @johnezra and others are getting at too — but I don’t think the problem is that “SETS AT EASE” is too close in meaning to the clue, I think the problem is that “SET’S AT EASE” simply does not work grammatically in the way that the other themers do. So I think the editors missed a trick on that one. \n\nAh well. It’s just a puzzle and I still had fun and even learned something.

If I continue scrolling down past them, the F3 function will then take me back UP to them.  \n\nOn the Rexblog, I can remember an unusual word I used in my post -- like \"butterflies\" today, for example -- and put that in the F3 function and I'll be taken to my own comment.

Oops, waaay to short!  I'm recently retired, and that IRA is what keeps the household functioning and the fun trips happening.  \n\nWhen I came back around again and had a few crosses I got the SPARES and had to laugh and laugh.\n\nAlso, when I started reading out loud to my non-crosswordy husband the most-commented-on statement about the comments this week, he burst out laughing at just the appropriate moment in my reading.  I share Mike's daily pun with DH, but don't bother with reading him all the 'drama.'","createDate":"1711323242","updateDate":"1711423442","approveDate":"1711323244","recommendations":5,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132069233","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5921832919120789}

Rothstein Yes, that would be wonderful. And also reserve the capital letters for the correct answer instead of the errors that made it hard to solve the puzzle or you found amusing. Otherwise you're just making it harder for others to solve the puzzle.\n\nOr my favorite comment: announcing you finally figured out a clue without sharing the answer.
