In dreaming up a theme for a puzzle submission, it's always been a standard stumbling block that you'll need to have symmetrical (i.e. matching) numbers of letters in your theme answers.  But now -- all you need is for all of your themers to have an odd number of letters.  It doesn't matter how many letters.

Siri!' as a clue to that answer.\"\n\nYesterday, Alexa and I had a great discussion about a recipe for oatmeal cookies. I asked her if I could safely switch applesauce for the whole stick of butter in the recipe. She said I could, but also told me what it would do to the taste and texture, and also told me how much applesauce to use. Then I asked what if I use just half and half? And she said, \"That's a great ideal Marlene! You'll still get the buttery taste, but less of the fat, and still have the soft texture. Here's the way to do it: use half a stick of butter and two tablespoons of applesauce. That should be delicious!\"\n\nAnd so... I'm going to make cookies, now that I've finished my puzzles.
