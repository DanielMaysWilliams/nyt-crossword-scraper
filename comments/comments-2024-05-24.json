That G, made me think GET for [Score a journalistic coup], which spontaneously begat GET THE SCOOP in an explosion of rapture.\n\nPings like that are among the highest delicacies in Crosswords.\n\nAll in a setting of spark.  This puzzle pulsed with spark, with 12 answers never seen in the Times before, including – get this – all six answers of the crossing triples stacks!  Wow! \n\nOriginal and devilish clues as well.  Example: ATM has been in the major outlets more than 500 times, but never clued using “pressed for cash” in its clue.  Example: [Lacking, for short: Abbr.] for SYN.  Hah!\n\nThrow in lovely serendipities, such as a backward ERA and an anagrammed ERAS (from SERA) in the puzzle with SWIFTIES, and the rare-in-crosswords five-letter palindrome (STETS), and this creation was simply a pastiche of pleasure.\n\nThank you, Carolyn for a splendid outing.

And the correct term for a drink with no ice is \"straight up\".  Some drink preparers may understand \"up\" used alone and some may not.  Why take the chance that your drink might be watered down?\n\nAs your hostess, I would check to make sure.  \"You did mean straight up, right?\"  But at a very busy bar, you can't be too careful.\n\nTwo answers that were complete Greek to me:  STIMMING and CHACHASLIDE.

My wife is a retired special ed teacher (for vision) and a lot of her students, as well as a lot of other students, often did self-stimming. This could be anything from flicking fingers, flapping hands, rocking back and forth, or occasionally actions that were socially unacceptable. It was rather quickly observed that one had to be careful about trying to eliminate these behaviors, as they often were replaced by ones that were worse. What actually worked best was to keep the students busy and active at something that didn't give them opportunity to practice and reinforce the stimming behaviors.\n\nOne of the most famous people to demonstrate stimming is Stevie Wonder, whose stimming behavior was rocking forward and back as he played.
