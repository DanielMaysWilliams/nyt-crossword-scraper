If there are any parties on game days (and that would be a football, as in soccer, game here), they will be at bars or people's homes, not outside - unless the supporters organize a parade after a particularly important win.\n\nThen there featured not one but two defunct American car brands of AMC and REO.

I thought maybe I was missing some memetic context for the clue. Maybe a post on Twitter or Bluesky about bad AI poetry had caught constructor Joe Rodini’s eye?\n\nUnfortunately I wasn’t able to find anything of that sort, which would serve only as a marginal excuse for an AI-generated clue. I suppose Joe is an early adopter of generative AI, that technology which hopes to do all the fun of thinking for us.\n\nIf you believe, like me, that good crossword construction is an art form… (buckle in for this analogy, please…) seeing an AI-generated clue is like finding out a visual artist I trust uses AI to colorize their work. It’s like finding out a musician I respect uses AI to write their melodies.\n\nNotice I’m using the present tense, here. If Will Shortz and the rest of the team allow AI clues once, then it’s open season going forward. We’re “fortunate” that Joe included a disclaimer this time; next time we may not be so lucky. The creation of a good crossword is arcane enough that they could easily decide to use AI to speed up the process in the future. In fact they may already be doing it, and we’d never know.\n\nNext time that I see an AI-generated clue in the NYT crossword, I will cancel my sub. If the constructors (and editor) feel they can use this artificial shortcut past a human’s authentic and artistic act of creation, then I don’t feel the need to provide a human solver.","createDate":"1747115694","updateDate":"1747191803","approveDate":"1747115696","recommendations":10,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142083734","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.562951922416687}

AI can analyze vast databases of words, clues, and themes to generate puzzles that are not only more diverse but also tailored to various skill levels and interests. It reduces the time and labor involved in manually constructing grids while maintaining symmetry, coherence, and creativity. Moreover, AI can introduce novel clueing styles, fresh vocabulary, and cultural inclusivity by drawing from a wide array of sources. Far from replacing human ingenuity, AI serves as a powerful tool that augments the puzzle-maker’s craft, allowing for greater experimentation and accessibility in this beloved form of wordplay.","createDate":"1747139016","updateDate":"1747170193","approveDate":"1747139016","recommendations":5,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142087384","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.531242847442627}

I think we have a ways to go before AI can create a truly creative quality crossword by itself at the NYT level. But here’s my take on using it for a creative purpose, I’m curious what the AI haters think:\nI’m a painter, and traditionally have painted from (my own) photos, and not infrequently combining various photos into a novel scene using photoshop. I admit I don’t have the imagination to create such scenes completely without a photo or model (and few painters to my knowledge do or did). Lately I have been generating the elements of such complex scenes entirely using AI. I spend hours creating and refining the prompts and output to match my vision, so I feel reasonably certain I’m not copying an existing work or artist (and occasionally the AI surprises me with an element I didn’t expect but love). Then I put the elements together in my final vision and of course in the course of painting, my own creativity adds another layer of variation. I happily tell anyone who sees it that AI was involved in the creation, and while I don’t usually sell my paintings would gladly tell any buyer that as well. I’m happy with the results and so are the people who see it.

The family car was an Ambassador wagon at the beginning of that timeframe; we were living in Brooklyn when we got it.  When we moved to the suburbs, my mother learned to drive, and she got a Javelin, which was a very sporty-looking full-size two-door car.  Having another full-sized car, my father replaced the wagon with a little sporty Gremlin with the sharply sloping hatchback.  Also a very distinctive-looking car.\n\nWhen I got my license, I bought a used Hornet.  It was a small sedan and much more normal-looking than the Gremlin.\n\nAfter four years of college, I moved back to the city and junked the ready-to-die Hornet.  The junkyard man wanted to give me $25; I held out for $50, saying at least I drove it in.  I figured not having to tow it was worth the other $25 to him, and I was right.\n\nOne impetus of my parents moving out of the city was that my dad had an office in the suburbs.  One Saturday, my parents and my 3- or 4-year-old brother went up to the office in the wagon, and came back on the train.  Why?  In those days, the gearshifts didn't lock when you parked your car.  My brother somehow got out of the office and into the car, which was parked on a hill, put the car in reverse, and wound up against a tree on the other side of the street.  Luckily, he didn't get creamed by an oncoming car.\n\nWhat great memories of those old AMCs!","createDate":"1747141246","updateDate":"1747173590","approveDate":"1747141246","recommendations":11,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142088699","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7796763777732849}

Maybe not in the US though :)\n\nMy maternal grandfather was something of a bigshot in Poland in the 1960s, so he owned what was considered a *very* fancy car back then - simply because it was Western - a VW Beetle. You can't possibly imagine the strings you had to pull to privately import a car from the West!\n\nWell, anyway, my mother, 16 at the time, drove that car a lot all over Warsaw, usually without her father's permission. Once, she was out on the town with the car when she realized it had got late. Her father was coming home and would notice the car missing from in front of their aparment building! She rushed out of wherever it was she was having fun only to find the Beetle blocked on both ends by other cars parked too close. Oh, no! What was she to do? She looked around and spotted a group of young soldiers walking down the street. She asked them for help, and... They lifted the car and carried it out onto the road :D. She arrived home just in time to avoid a row with her father, who apparently never bothered to check if the engine was suspicously hot :)","createDate":"1747145690","updateDate":"1747184585","approveDate":"1747145690","recommendations":13,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142091722","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6965304017066956}

As a longtime solver I had a visceral negative reaction on reading the clue. What I appreciate about creating and solving crosswords is how effortful it is—based on our shared references and knowledge, and our desire to challenge ourselves. \n\nI don’t want to comment on the intentions of the constructor but even if intended to poke fun at AI’s lack of poetic flair, or as a novel way to clue something, it fell completely flat for me. It is interesting for a solver, and requires effort for a constructor, to use wordplay or a novel reference. It takes the human element and the effort out to instead effectively create an empty reference just for the sake of a clue—with neither the cleverness of wordplay nor the opportunity to reference shared knowledge or learn something new that you get with scientific, literary references, etc.\n\nIf someone’s ten-year old wrote this poem that would be perfectly nice, but I also would find it weird to see it pop up for EYES clued as ‘in my child’s poetry’ or the falsely universal ‘in children’s poetry.’ Like, fine, that’s interesting, but not really universal/well-known or noteworthy enough for a clue! \n\nI would suspect that most solvers, like myself, are not so much upset about this clue specifically or mad at the constructor as galled to see this type of clue pop up in the crossword.

The most common auto was the Fiat 126p (a Polish-made, atrocious version of the Italian Fiat 126). Look it up online, now, please, for example here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_126\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_126</a> \n\nSo now that you know what car it was, imagine a family going on vacation in one, with luggage for 2 or 3 weeks of hiking. The car had no boot to speak of (the engine was in the back, and in the front there was a tiny compartment that could fit one small bag, maybe), so much of our stuff was in the cabin, with me squeezed between the bags and the metalwork of the car's body. Of course we had a roof rack, too. The 650 cc engine with its 20-ish BHP propelled us over uber dangerous Polish roads for hundreds of kilometers.\n\nIn the mid 1980s my parents replaced the Fiat 126p with the East German Wartburg 353W: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartburg_(marque\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartburg_(marque</a>)\n\nIt was much larger, but it broke down all the time, and the ventillation never worked well, so when the windows misted over, you had to drive without seeing anything. Often my father would have one hand on the wheel, and in the other he would hold a rag to wipe the inside of the windshield time after time. It smelled of motoroil and gasoline inside, which meant I was nauseous all the time on all our travels. The engine was more powerful (over 40 BP!!!!), and my mother drove the car like she was crazy. 140 kp/h across Warsaw?

She rushed out of wherever it was she was having fun only to find the Beetle blocked on both ends by other cars parked too close. Oh, no! What was she to do? She looked around and spotted a group of young soldiers walking down the street. She asked them for help, and... They lifted the car and carried it out onto the road :D.
