You can find the ballot here:\n\n<a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/253465756808167\" target=\"_blank\">https://form.jotform.com/253465756808167</a>\n\nJohn Ezra, Marshall Walthew and I were pleased to see so many puzzles nominated. That does make the ballot rather lengthy — I think there are about 100 puzzles across the four categories.\n\nThe puzzle descriptions are not meant to simply remind you of the puzzle. We’ve done our best to make sure that all the nominated puzzles are on the ballot. Our sincere apologies if you nominated a puzzle and it’s not on the ballot.\n\nIf you wish to vote, be sure you’ll have time to finish the ballot. As far as I can tell, there’s no way to save your choices if you start the ballot and don’t submit it. However, you’ll get an email with your votes and may be able to add votes if you’re under five in any category.  You will get a somewhat generic error message if you try to select more than five puzzles in any category. The message pops up as soon as you choose a sixth puzzle, so it’s easily fixed by deselecting one of your choices. It’s actually a pretty good way of keeping you focused on the best of the best. And if you want to be sure you’ve selected five, try choosing one more. At the end of the relevant section of the ballot, it will say “The maximum number of selections allowed is 5.”\n\nWe hope you’ll find the ballot user-friendly. If you have any trouble with it, comment here. One of us will  see it.\n\nThanks for voting!","createDate":"1768086457","updateDate":"1768186998","approveDate":"1768086457","recommendations":19,"replyCount":14,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147950357","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7400577664375305}

It was perfect for somebody from the (PHI)LADELPHIA area.  To start,  I admired the grid’s elegant look, but I did not recognize it as a depiction of phi.  I spotted the Greek letter trick at DEL(PHI), and expected a variety of other Greek letters to appear as rebuses throughout the puzzle.  That idea was quickly dashed and I began looking for phis.  I was a little perplexed as to why phi only worked in one direction, although I could at least discern the pattern, thus my ignorance did not hinder me.  Because I  had no idea what phi looked like, the reason for the I/O pairings eluded me until I finished.

The theme was nice - DEL[PHI] gave half of it away very early into my solve. However, it took the revealer to make me understand how the other half of the trick worked. I never thought of the letter phi looking like an I crossed an O, but it does seem like it, does it not?\n\nThe clueing was Tuesday-level, really, but I actually think that's great on Sunday. I never enjoy hard puzzles this time of the week - a huge and hard grid just takes too much effort, for me, and facing it feels like a chore rather than a fun, weekend activity. If I don't get a gold star upon entering the last letter, I just check the puzzle as I can't be arsed to flyspeck the immense grid. It felt great to not have to do that for once. For comparison, here is a screenshot of my \"solve\" of the tedious David Kwong Sunday on  December 21st 2025:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/0esWg4w\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/a/0esWg4w</a>\n\nAlso, I enjoyed how few proper names, abbreviations and crosswordese entries there were today - and what little of it there was I either knew or got from crosses without much effort.

If that’s what you want, there’s no need to come to the NYT. Just go pick up a church newsletter or a worksheet from your kid’s school.

It helped that I was able to paste in an actual Φ and that was accepted; if I'd got to the end of the puzzle with Φs in all of the squares and then had to go back and change them, I'm sure I'd have had a lower opinion of the puzzle.\n\nI've never heard of a crisscross puzzle before, and I was still able to figure it out once I saw the pattern with the rebusses.

You offer an interesting tidbit, not a nitpick.\n\nCommercially important, edible mushrooms include portobellos (Agaricus bisporus), whose forms include button mushrooms, cremini, and baby bellas, and shiitake (Lentinula edodes). The morels (Morchella, Verpa) and false morels or lorchels (Gyromitra, Helvella) are popularly included with the true mushrooms because of their shape and fleshy structure; they resemble a deeply folded or pitted conelike sponge at the top of a hollow stem. Some are among the most highly prized edible fungi (e.g., Morchella esculenta). Edible truffles (various Tuber species), which hardly resemble mushrooms, are also popularly labeled as such. These and other edible mushrooms and fungi are free of cholesterol and contain small amounts of essential amino acids and B vitamins. However, their chief worth is as a specialty food of delicate, subtle flavour and agreeable texture. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/mushroom\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.britannica.com/science/mushroom</a>","createDate":"1768157188","updateDate":"1768176605","approveDate":"1768157190","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147964564,"parentUserDisplayName":"michael mccann","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147965510","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7421663403511047}
