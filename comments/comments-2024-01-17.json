This time figurative Ls, as opposed to literal Ls, although they are that, too. \n\nBUT IS IT ART? -- Loved that. A question both to mock for its pretentiousness and to ponder for its answer. My friend Pat had a baby, we'll call him Reese. Pat loved art, loved going to museums, to galleries, to openings, and would drag baby Reese around with him starting when Reese was six months old. Reese enjoyed it, from what we could tell--he was a tactile kid, liked to look at things, handle things, get involved. He kept being told, especially at the museums, to keep his hands to himself, etc.  And when he was one and a half (or should I say half past one?), we all heard him utter his first sentence when some doting friend tried to pick him up: \"Don't touch me I'm art.\"  We were all like: Whaaaaat???  Reese is probably in his early thirties now. And of course we still kid him about it, singin' \"U don't touch me!\" to MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This when we see him...which is usually at an art opening...\n\nAnyways, this was a lively, cheery puzzle, with good humor and good intent. I felt challenged & enlivened by puzzlin' through, and even the glue words, ERR, ORCA and the like, had cluing with a bit of pizazz, which always redeems those words in my scoresheet. \n\nOK, Sam's photo choice is particularly challenging.

What's the problem then? The Polish translation.\n\nGiven the, to put it mildly, unusual names of all characters in the English text, the only way to translate the books was to have equally unusual names in Polish, possibly in the spirit of the original, but completely different otherwise. Pooh himself became... Kubuś Puchatek (in Polish Puch- sounds like Pooh; and since there is no name similar to Winnie in Polish, Pooh became... Jake, say, since Kubuś is one of the diminutives for Jacob - Jakub - in Polish; Puchatek indicates he is fluffy - puch=fluff), Eeyore became Kłapouchy (one with the droopy ears), etc.\n\nSo today some product I have never heard before (I have no idea what SANKA is, but given its slogan it must be some horribly, industrially mistreaded coffee not on sale in Poland for food safety reasons) crossing with the English name of a Pooh character I have never seen or heard before was my personal natick. At least the missing letter was easy to figure out. \n\nAlso, could somebody please explain Low states: FUNKS? I understand nothing here (which did not help with figuring out _ANK_ in the crossing).","createDate":"1705475614","updateDate":"1709600392","approveDate":"1705475616","recommendations":40,"replyCount":11,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130499966","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6540223956108093}

Seemed a bit of a stretch since you’d usually write “Dear Mrs Soandso -” if you were going to use a hyphen in place of a comma. Once I got HOLD-DEAR, I realised what the hyphens were indicating for the theme and it helped figure out the others.\n\nI think a better way to have hinted at the theme would have been putting the word COLLOCATION in the middle, where the hint was something like “A predictable word to follow, or the theme to today’s puzzle”. So if you had BULLET, you’d think of words like POINT, CASING, or TRAIN.","createDate":"1705576697","updateDate":"1705576698","approveDate":"1705576699","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130530248","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8771479725837708}

I don’t believe it does .  \n\nThere have been plenty of corner-turning answers in puzzles past, primarily on Thursdays and Sundays, but I don’t remember ever seeing this iteration, where the letter at the nexus gets double use.  \n\nIf indeed this is the first time this has been done in crosswords, then, in my opinion, it doesn’t need a revealer.  Due to its novelty, just showing it off is sufficient, and show it off Morton does!  \n\nAlso, there are many themed puzzles without revealers, where the answers all follow an engaging pattern, and I believe today’s puzzle falls into that category.\n\nOh, a scintillating revealer that connected all the answers, would have provided extra spark, but, IMO, it wasn’t necessary, and this puzzle had plenty of spark, I believe, without it.","createDate":"1705501946","updateDate":"1705531777","approveDate":"1705501947","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130503760,"parentUserDisplayName":"Xword Junkie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130505395","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6859773397445679}
