A good chewy Wednesday that didn't roll over too easily.

Pittsburgh was founded in the late 1740s when a contingent of Frenchmen journeyed down the Allegheny starting a little SE of Jamestown NY. Along the course of the river they embedded on its banks large leaden plaques declaring the surrounding land to be property of the king of France. A priest named Celoron, who accompanied the French, kept a journal that included an account of dining with Queen Aliquippa, a Seneca, and 27 others -- inside a hollowed-out tree! When they reached the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela, which forms the Ohio, they established a fort -- Fort Duquesne -- which the English burned down in November 1758, rebuilding it and renaming it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. \n\nRe Jacob's notes: as a Jew who married a shiksa, we get a Christmas tree for its joyous odor, and the city has a recycling program that turns them into pine mulch for residents' gardens.

Gato strips them of their plastic bark. He also tries to eat the fake snow off them, which we learned after Sam's Great Flecked Xmas Tree Purchase Fiasco of 2022, but that’s ancient history, and besides the flecked tree never saw the outside of its box again, and besides I don’t like to talk about it, and neither does my husband because he pinched a nerve getting that monstrosity out of—and then right back into—its box, only to find that our living-room ceiling was not, in fact, 9 ft tall, which is the only part he will talk about—with some relish, I might add (“You don’t have to be an engineer to check the dimensions under the product description link, Sam, blah blah numbers blah”). I find such comments entirely superfluous post hoc. Besides, the 12 in. of the tree proved to be very pliable and, in fact, looked very avant-garde. Or avant-plafond at any rate. It'd've undoubtedly proved to be a conversation piece, had it not proved to be cat food first. Or, rather, a cat emetic.

And I really mean \"live\" - once you cut a tree, it's not really alive any more. It would more accurately be termed a \"dying tree.\" \n\nOur Christmas trees were dug up, roots and all, by my father and, when I was older, by him and my brother and me. We would go out before the ground was frozen and dig one up.  He would encase the roots in burlap and it would sit in a tub in our cold garage until it was time to set it up indoors. It would be moved into the house, tub and all, and a decorative fabric draped over the galvanized tub.\n\nOnce the holidays were over, it would be returned to the garage until Spring, when we would plant it on the hill behind our house. I would estimate we had a success rate of well over 50% -- probably close to 75%. Some trees did succumb to the trauma, but it's still a lot less trauma than having the trunk sawn through. \n\nWe eventually had a pretty substantial and attractive grove of mostly blue spruces on that little knoll. \n\nI returned to that house a few years ago, over 50 years after my parents sold the house, and they are still there, easily seen because all trees growing naturally in the area are deciduous. Other than these tall blue spruces. No, they are not propagating, so they are not invasive (and blue spruce habitat is less than a mile away). \n\nSo, put me on either team \"no tree\" or on team \"truly live tree.\"\n\nMerry Christmas, one and all!","createDate":"1735143454","updateDate":"1735192183","approveDate":"1735143458","recommendations":40,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138530722","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7198113799095154}

This variant sound of g, which is not found in English, is represented by linguists as [ɣ].  The fact that the following U minimizes the G further doesn't help the fact that English speakers cannot hear it at all and take it as a silent G.\n\nSo they pronounce the cactus or the national park  /səˈwɑː.rə/ (as per Cambridge and M-W), using the definitively un-Spanish schwa as the first and last vowels as well.
