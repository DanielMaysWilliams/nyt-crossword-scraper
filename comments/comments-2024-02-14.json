Even driver education is not mandatory *for graduation.*  (However, in Ohio, to be licensed a teen must take a series of classes and pass the exam, then log 50 hours of supervised driving--ten of which must be after dark-- and finally pass the test at the license bureau, which includes backing through a curving path marked by cones.

About a quarter century ago, in the middle of the night as I drove along I-95 in Connecticut, I pulled in to a rest stop to use the facilities. At the same moment, a stretch limo parked opposite me. A person from that limo was walking up the path and I did a little double take, thinking “I know him from somewhere…” He saw that recognition on my face and steeled himself for a greeting or gushing that would never come, because I was and still largely am showbiz illiterate.\n\nWhen I got home, I called my TV obsessed friend and exclaimed: “I peed next to that guy!”\n— “What guy?”\n“The guy I like from the show you like on TV!”\n— “Josh, from the West Wing? Bradley Whitford?”\n“Yeah, him!”\n\nHe was relieved that I hadn’t interacted with him, but, frankly, I didn’t know his name, his character’s name, or the name of the show he was on.

I remember staying at a roadside hotel outside of a town on Lake Garda, and on my last night, the desk manager brought out 5 different bottles of grappa for me and we sampled each one. Until then, I'd only tried the grappa normally sold in U.S. liquor stores, which I referred to as \"crappa\". But these were heavenly. Same thing with Limoncello, although most of it is tourist swill. But if you find someone on the Amalfi coast who makes it at home, you'll get why it's a thing. I tried to make Cedrello from citrons I harvested in Morocco.
