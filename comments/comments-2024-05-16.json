Some of them were original, such as [Pounds, perhaps] for ACHES, and [Down more than] for OUTEAT.  All of them had me smiling throughout the solve, and that is a gift.\n\nI filled in the entire grid except for the revealer, and wrenched my brain trying to crack what it could be, trying to see how the theme answers could relate to their clues.  All to no avail.  Finally, after uncle-ing, I had to bow down to the beauty of the conceit, to the wit of taking ALL FOR ONE, ONE FOR ALL, and first, seeing this theme, then second, beautifully executing it.\n\nI liked the duplicate [Stag] clues – could have had another duplicate by using [Carpenter or mason] for TRADE as well as for BUILDER.\n\nFirst thing I thought of after solving this was that I want to see more puzzles from you, Sara, with your love of wordplay and your ability to craft a terrific theme.
