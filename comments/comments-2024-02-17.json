Now I realize that these combinations don't have to be parts of one word.\n\nThese combinations were a little disconcerting anyway, throwing me off just a little, despite the fact that I didn't get seriously stumped in any part of the puzzle and finished with a rather good time for a Saturday.\n\nThe second thing I noticed that there were a lot of uncommon letters in the puzzle and I wondered whether this was a pangram.  Not surprised to find out that it's actually a double pangram.

It uses a slightly crispy yet chewy fried rice patty as the base and is topped with a layer of sliced avocado, a layer of sliced salmon, tuna or crab meat, a drizzle of blended mayonnaise and wasabi powder and is served in wedges.

During the episode the word “dronie” was used several times, and dronies were featured in completing a task. This was an absolutely new word to me, but:\n\n- context made the meaning immediately apparent,\n- the word’s structure made the meaning apparent,\n- and even the “proper spelling” of the neologism could be deduced because it follows the rules of English.\n\nSo when I searched for it online, I had difficulty but eventually found it (there are lots of similar words out there) - with a first citation around 2014.\n\nA selfie taken by a drone — portmanteau: dronie.\n\nI expect it will be added to puzzle constructors’ word lists soon.

Errors do happen. \n\nThere are many complaints about puzzles that are not valid, but I think this is one of the rare legitimate ones. \n\nI don't know or speak Italian, so I went on a little search and I find the etymology of ZITI varies widely, depending on the source. Some sources say ZITI is the word for the bride, some say it is the word for bridegroom and others say other things entirely. \n\nThe entry for ZITI on Wikipedia has this passage:\n\n\"Ziti is the plural form of zita and zitu, respectively meaning 'bride' and 'groom' in Sicilian. For this reason, ziti may also be rendered as zite in Italian (with the regular plural form for feminine nouns in -a).[2]\"\n\nI don't know if we're dealing with regionalisms or what. Wikipedia says its origin is Sicilian; Teresa refers to Southern Italian. I have no idea if Sicilian is a dialect separate form Southern Italian, or *is* Southern Italian, but it seems the constructor is close to, but not exactly, on the mark. But the clue might better have included the hedge \"derived from\" rather than so confidently saying \"literal meaning\". \n\nSo, those of you who think I defend every entry -- please copy and paste this response into a note app and refer to it when getting angry at me for rebutting any of the many, many illegitimate criticisms that too frequently appear in these comments.","createDate":"1708206133","updateDate":"1708359721","approveDate":"1708206135","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131242782,"parentUserDisplayName":"Teresa Carioti","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131243583","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5629761219024658}

Duncan Dekker and the Quintuple Pangram\nThe name David C. Duncan Dekker is notorious, at least among active crossword solvers with a good memory. On August 10th, 2016 he constructed the New York Times puzzle, a Wednesday. The puzzle was notable for being a quintuple pangram (it contains every letter of the alphabet at least five times) and was somewhat controversial due to more contrived entries like DXIX or FOHN and NMEX, that resulted from the quintuple pangram constraints.\n\nThe Crosswordfiend Meltdown\nCrosswordfiend is a popular blog in the community, where commenters will discuss the NYT and other daily puzzles. On the day of his puzzle, David left a series of combative comments on Crosswordfiend. David took issue with an edit that Will Shortz had made to his grid, complaining that he \"should have been consulted with first before any changes were made to a puzzle I poured my mind into.\"\n\n David also defended the entries in his puzzle, claiming that \"Roman numerals WILL always be a part of crossword construction\" and asking another commenter who claimed to dislike seeing Roman numerals in puzzles \"So, you prefer the mind not to travel into a deeper thought of calculation?\"\n\nThis saga ended with David saying Will Shortz had sent him an email that read \"Don’t bother sending me any more puzzles.\" While at least one more puzzle by David would run in the New York Times, it's possible that puzzle had already been accepted for publication by the time of David's meltdown.","createDate":"1708211718","updateDate":"1708289396","approveDate":"1708211720","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131245039,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bob T.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131245122","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8131476640701294}

The puzzle itself was rather uncontroversial and went by without much major discussion. However, at some point on Sunday, it was noticed that xwordinfo (a semi-official record of NYT puzzles) listed the puzzle as being by--yup, you guessed it: David C. Duncan Dekker. Xwordinfo helpfully explained: \"Tina Labadie is a pseudonym for David C. Duncan Dekker.\" Once people connected the dots, the community erupted with hilarity tinged with no small amount of outrage.\n\nFurther questions\nIt's still unclear at this point whether Will Shortz and the rest of the editorial team at the NYT knew whether Tina Labadie was a pseudonym or not.

And if they did know, why would they allow David to publish under a female pseudonym and masquerade as a first-time constructor? It's entirely possible that David chose a female pseudonym as simply one more way of thumbing his nose at Shortz, at a time when efforts to diversify the constructors who run in the Times are widely discussed.\n\nIt was quickly puzzled out by crossword constructor Byron Walden that Tina Labadie anagrams to AINT A BAD LIE. And it's been asked whether David C. Duncan Dekker might also be a pseudonym--it's certainly an unusually styled name.
