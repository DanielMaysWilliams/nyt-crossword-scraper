Luckily, I read the clue for the Roman numeral relatively early on, worked it backwards from the I to the M and that gave me the spine of the grid, from which I then built on. As I did, thinking about the clues (very, very few of which were gimmes), filling in the entries bit by bit, I was very aware of how extremely well this puzzle had been thought out. I finished pretty quickly given its level of difficulty (just barely sliding in with single digits, if I may brag for a moment), despite the Saturday-like vagueness of the clues and lots of unknowns, but that’s just such a testament to the skill of the constructor. This was all about logic and free-associating. The absolutely best kind of puzzle. \n\nWho is this masked crusader, I asked myself when I finished. \n\nAh. Adam Aronson. Well, no wonder then. Hats off, Adam. The work of a master. \n\nOne nit. A borderline political one. MLK is clued as a string of letters. Okay, fine, I won’t quibble with the slightly flippant clue because it’s hard to clue him without immediately giving away the answer since he’s such an iconic figure. But then we have Lenin with the anodyne clue of an “advocate” for “political mobilization.” The man was directly responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths (millions in some estimates). He was the author of the Red Terror, Cheka, camps, unspeakable brutality. \n\nC’mon, editors. You don’t pull punches when you clue Idi Amin. A nice, positive Lenin, though?","createDate":"1768646862","updateDate":"1768707718","approveDate":"1768646864","recommendations":34,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148140950","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-17","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5100621581077576}
