It's a good question whether a clue that asks for the \"Latin [word] for 'before'\" can be answered with any case of the desired word.  However, as Steve L. would point out, technically every declension of prius has the same basic meaning as it does in the nominative.\n\nMost people in the U.S. learn grammar (including declension and conjugation) when they learn a foreign language.  Grammar in their native tongue comes naturally.  I suspect that this is true not only of Americans.\n\nFewer Americans study foreign language than do people in other (educated) countries, and many Americans expect \"foreigners\" (i.e. non-Americans) to speak (American) English, whether they are at home or abroad.  This makes me sad.\n\nBut many Americans do know foreign languages.

And I don't use them, so I usually forget to make that distinction! The NYT Games are also accessible via a browser on those mobile devices.\n\nOn a computer, the only access is via a browser -- also known as a web browser -- such as when you solve in the archive. \n\nEach of these form factors is served a different layout in what is sometimes called \"responsive design\", meaning elements are rearranged to fit the screen size and orientation. Simplistically, these are identified as \"mobile\" or \"phone\"; \"tablet\"; and \"desktop\", though that last could be either a laptop or a larger computer with a standalone monitor. \n\nSo for example, when I open the Games main page on my phone, boxes with access to the Crossword and Mini display side by side at the top, with just a simple button below linking to the Wordplay column. (The other games, ads, stats, archive, etc. all display farther down the page.) Once you're in the puzzle, there is no direct access to Wordplay -- it's like as you described, having to open it on another page.\n\nOn the larger computer screen, however, the crossword grid is laid out on the left and the clues on the right; Wordplay access is immediately below the grid, displayed (as article links are throughout the NYT website) with a thumbnail image + headline.

I'm a morning/afternoon solver so my rare comments usually end up where few would see them, and I wasn't sure you would. I'm beyond glad that you found my advice useful and reassuring. It seems one of my side gigs in retirement is helping family and friends, who like me are experiencing the perils of older age, navigate the opaque and sometimes very unhelpful health care system. I have a lot of time for it recently as I am recovering from an unexpected total hip replacement, after a fall while skiing at Whistler last month resulted in a fracture. I followed my own advice, with the help of knowledgeable colleagues, and found an excellent surgeon at the \"other UW\" in Seattle. (I'm a Badger). I'm coming along well and I hope you have a successful and stress-free ablation--it sounds as if you are in great hands. One of the things I constantly marveled at and never took for granted when I was working was the way total strangers trusted me and the team with their lives, often with very little time for consultation. It was an amazing connection. I miss that and hope you find practitioners with a similar approach.
