A wonderful theme, I thought…and as former newspaper and magazine writer, I’m all for pay walls, though of course they frustrate me at times…but I recognize their importance for getting writers/photographers/editors paid. When people I know complain, I always ask: would a plumber fix your faucet for free.\n\nOne small memory flash from 30A (SPEAKS ONE’S PIECE): \n\nIn 1986, I was laid off from the regional magazine where I worked. Pretty quickly, I got hire at an alternative weekly, where I worked with a marvelous journalist, J A Lobbia, who was under five feet tall but fierce in every way. As the two staff writers, we shared our work with each other as a check before it went to the editor.  I had ambitions in creative writing and if I pushed those tendencies too far, when I gave her one of my stories to read, she’d snap, “You’re just showing off.” She was always right and I’d cut the show-offy parts before I turned it in.\n\nOne day, when I handed her my work, I said, “Here’s my piece.” She said, “This is a newspaper. We call them articles.”\n\nI left the paper after three years to get an MFA in fiction, then joined the faculty at a mid-sized university. JA ended up at the Village Voice, where, even from 900 miles away, I could tell she was still fierce. Sadly, she died at 43, in 2001. So, thanks, Phillip Koski, for the nudge to remember her.","createDate":"1739369257","updateDate":"1739413270","approveDate":"1739369259","recommendations":38,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139725478","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8705264329910278}

It is refreshing to do puzzles that are, frankly, challenging again. Too many of the current puzzles seem to be so easy, and they still garner copious complaints from people who find them too hard. I think the complainers have won - the puzzles have been dumbed down as a result. \n\nI have a couple of questions.\n\n1. For those who have already been working through the archive -- sometimes you mention reading the accompanying comments. I have been unable to find them. I am still in 1993 -- were there no comments then? I suspect not, since the WWW barely existed then. (I first started using the WWW in 1995, and it was very new then.) When did the comments start, and how when I get to that date, will there be an easy way to find them? \n\n2. In the December 10, 1993 puzzle, the clue for 3D is \"Attic contest\" and the answer is AGON.  Can someone explain this to me? I know that, among other definitions, AGON is a theatrical device, often used in Greek theater. Is this a typo: should the clue have been \"Attica contest\" instead of \"Attic contest\"? \n\nPlease note that I am not complaining or spewing hatred at the constructor or editor (Will Shortz). I am not going on and on about how this is completely wrong, or that it ruined the puzzle for me, or ruined my entire day. (Yes, I have seen that last gripe more than once, and it is stunning to me that a simple crossword puzzle could in any way ruin someone's entire day.) \n\nAny \"attic\" help?","createDate":"1739380862","updateDate":"1739410327","approveDate":"1739380863","recommendations":10,"replyCount":16,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139735607","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.446548193693161}
