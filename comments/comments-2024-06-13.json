Lots of aha moments for me: \"Frontier figure,\" \"Padded piece of paper,\" for two), and most importantly, a poetry reference!\n\nIn the West we learn almost nothing about haiku, especially not about the fact that they were the center of one of the richest poetic cultures ever to exist. In Basho's time, haiku masters (tenja, or \"graders\") would hold contests that would have 10s of thousands of entrants. In bars, tenja would be paid to score haiku for groups of friends: everyone would throw money into the pot, the judge would give points to each poem along with witty commentary, and the pot would be split proportionally to the points awarded. The practice was so widespread and occasionally contentious that the authorities considered banning it as a form of gambling. Remember that Edo, the capital city, was one of -- if not the -- most populous cities in the world in the 17th century, with almost a million inhabitants. \n\nBasho (\"Banana Tree\"), in fact, was not always known as Basho. His first nom de plume was Tosei (\"Green Peach\"), and he made his money as a haiku judge until he grew disallusioned with the competitive vibe of Edo's haiku culture and retired to the country and renamed himself after the Japanese banana tree that grew outside his front door. \n\nNowadays, those of us with a penchant for pithy, surprising turns of phrase have to content ourselves with crosswords. \n\nPadded piece\nof paper, perhaps?\nResume.","createDate":"1718285380","updateDate":"1718329603","approveDate":"1718285384","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133881157","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9424929022789001}

Hebrew, both ancient and modern, is normally written without vowel markings (there is a modern system of vowel points—see example below—that is used in some cases, but didn’t exist in ancient times).  So that name, or Jehovah, or anything else, is just a guess, since there’s no way of knowing how the name was pronounced when it was supposedly revealed. \n\nIt is etymologically related to how God responded when Moses asked who he should say sent him,  אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה‎,  (I am that I am). \n\nMany Jews will not write Yahweh, Jehovah, God, Lord or many other words out in full, nor will they say any of the possible names of God. Instead, they will write G-d or L-rd in English, and substitute another word, such as Adonai (my Lords) in Hebrew (using a kind of royal plural).\n\nA religious Jew would not be able to complete this puzzle if it meant having to write Yahweh in (although it has appeared in the puzzle 11 times). \n\nBut a religious Jew wouldn’t be solving crossword puzzles today anyway, as it is the holy day of Shavuot, when among other labors, writing is prohibited.  \n\nAt least until nightfall.","createDate":"1718278595","updateDate":"1718556289","approveDate":"1718278598","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133876083,"parentUserDisplayName":"Chris g","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133878755","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5618858933448792}

I've seen the skit \"Black Jeopardy,\" although I think there have been multiple skits, with different scripts and actors, with those names. But it still surprised me that a *particular*  skit would be referenced in the clue. Insider baseball.\n\nI apologize for the mansplaining, if that's how it came across.","createDate":"1718287505","updateDate":"1718328269","approveDate":"1718287508","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133881716,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133882187","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7834537029266357}

First, I do not believe you can print the puzzle directly from the NYT app. I believe you need to do it while in your browser. To do that bring up the Wordplay column in Safari and scroll to the very bottom of the page where you will see blue links to Wordle, the Crossword, etc. click the Crossword link and the puzzle should come up. If you touch the very top of the screen some task icons will appear in the upper right corner. The third one in looks like a little square with an upward pointing arrow coming out of it. If you click that a bunch of options like copy (to clipboard) or print will come up. If you are connected to a printer you should be able to print directly. Otherwise you can send the copy to your computer or paste it in another document and print or email that. Let us know if any of that works for you!","createDate":"1718311935","updateDate":"1718319953","approveDate":"1718311938","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133890989,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mark","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133893254","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8533493280410767}
