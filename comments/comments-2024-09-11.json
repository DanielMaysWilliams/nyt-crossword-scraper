If it seems a remote possiblity for fill, try it out -- for example, the other day there was a clue with an unusual-sounding instrument. With one crossing letter filled, I suddenly realized -- as a 4-letter answer, why not try \"oboe\". And I was right! \n\nI also like so-called proper nouns because they provide guess-proof crossings.
