I didn’t have the patience to spend long enough to explore the web as fully as I might, but I did find one comment suggesting that the term pre-dates the internet, which is what I had always thought.\n\nBack in the good(?) old days, when we used carbon paper to make duplicates of letters prepared on a typewriter, one would simply add the letters “bcc” to the carbon copy intended to be sent to someone (B) other than the intended recipient of the original letter (A).  In this way,  B would know about A but would realize that A would not know about B.\n\nSpeaking of typewriters, I am reminded of an incident when Sam was quite young, but old enough to be  comfortable with the use of computers and their peripheral devices.  She came into my office at home and was fascinated by an IBM Selectric typewriter sitting on a desk.  She wanted to know what it was.  I fed a sheet of paper in and turned the machine on.  Then I began hitting a few keys at random to show her how it worked.  I went back to my desk and listened as Sam experimented with the keys.  Then she caught me off guard with her question, “Dad, how do you make it print?”","createDate":"1716763397","updateDate":"1716860721","approveDate":"1716763399","recommendations":27,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133476874","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8304201364517212}

I would definite call it a pastry,on account of its shape and lack of yeast leavening (but then, how would one define a baba?).\n\nI'd defer to the OED, but it unhelpfully defines it as a \"cake\"; and also lists six different pronunciations, across five countries, for the vowel. Fun to listen to them all.\n\nAll of this reminds me of an Intro to Linguistics class I took--back in another life--in which the professor brought in a dozen or so different vessels, and asked the class whether each was a \"glass,\" \"cup,\" or \"mug.\" Heated arguments ensued.\n\nI've never eaten scones in the British Isles, but I'd expect they have a lot less sugar. My opinion is most American pastry has way too much sugar, because American tastes demand it. Traditionally, a (butter) cake would have a 1:1 ratio of sugar to flour; now, 7:6 is the least that's acceptable, with some recipes getting a lot more sweet than that. Muffins have evolved into unfrosted cupcakes.\n\nThe cheesecake recipe I currently use has a ratio of about 5:1 cream cheese to sugar, much lower than most, but gets a lot of compliments. \n\nHappy Memorial Day, everyone!
