The English-language transliteration aims to approximate how the word is pronounced,  Given that Hebrew has variations in pronunciation, like any language, this can be somewhat messy.\n\nThe word in question is often transliterated as MATZAH, MATZOH or even just MATZO.  Any of these spellings is as good as any other; it's just that in this puzzle, only one of them fits, as there's no such game as KENa.","createDate":"1706498118","updateDate":"1706733761","approveDate":"1706498120","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130777031,"parentUserDisplayName":"HeathieJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130777512","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8822060823440552}

I have paraphrased the historical material and included quotation marks around a direct quote.  I have not cited the author's name.  If this be plagiarism, make the most of it.\n\nMany stories, ballads, and plays dealing with the basic theme of wooing, winning, and taming a wife were popular  in the 16th century.  Shakespeare himself may have written one of them.  The Taming of the Shrew as we know it was published in the 1623 Folio edition.  The Induction, or prologue, appears there.  David Garrick removed the Induction for a 1754 production and that became the standard practice for more than a century.\n\n\"The Induction, finely written, establishes a fundamentally serious concern with the powers of persuasion to change not merely appearance but reality, and this theme is acted out at different levels in both strands of the subsequent action.\" \n\nThe dialog of their first meeting takes some close reading and archaic vocabulary to notice the bawdy bits.\n(\"Cate\" is an archaic word that means a choice food or delicacy.  \"Arms\" can refer to a noble's coat-of-arms.)","createDate":"1706500264","updateDate":"1706537873","approveDate":"1706500266","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130777090,"parentUserDisplayName":"john ezra","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130777898","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8633528351783752}

I wasn't aware of the importance of the Induction and will have to read that more closely. If Garrick's removal of it in 1754 became the standard model for more than a century that would imply some restoration of the Induction by the late 19th century. Maybe they (Streep and co.) figured that the attendees were getting their money's worth anyway, or could be there were some time regulations for the park...anyway, I'm a fan of Sly and his drunken epigrams, very much in the Bottom / Falstaff mold.
