It’s a fairly elementary concept in computer programming, and the majority of languages that are used nowadays support it, usually using that exact keyword as part of the language’s syntax. The key is the “catchall” part.\n\nYou could imagine a rudimentary program that asks the user to type in their name and then displays a response based on what they enter, rendered in pseudocode below.\n\nprint “What is your name?” // Displays the prompt.\nname = getUserInput() // Takes whatever the user types in and assigns it to (stores it in) a part of the computer’s memory that is arbitrarily labeled “name” for ease of reading the code\nIF name == “Bob”: // Performs first test\n  print “Hi, Bob! Nice name. That’s short for Robert, right?” // Output if first test passed\nELSE IF name == “Alice”: //Performs second test\n  print “Hi, Alice! Nice name. Did you just return from Wonderland?” // Output if second test passed\nELSE: // Catchall for all other cases, if both the preceding tests fail\n  print “Hi, “ + name + “! I’ve never heard that one before. It sounds nice.” // Output if the user entered anything other than “Bob” or “Alice”\n\nThe last, catchall ELSE (not followed by IF) is important because it’s almost always impossible for a programmer to anticipate every possible condition that could occur in a program or script that accepts external input (or is even just large and complicated).","createDate":"1734610160","updateDate":"1734656960","approveDate":"1734610162","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138396598,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138400393","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7946797609329224}

It was just easy on (and pleasant to) the brain in the way that some opera singers say Mozart is on their vocal cords and spirit.

It was a shock when the streak ended, but I too am relieved to be less beholden to the effort (though I do get caught up in it when I'm on a bit of a run!).\n\nHopefully you can continue to find joy and even solace in the crossword - and you should be proud of a 370 day streak!
