It's an adventure novel where much of the action takes place in Dorset, known for its great hedgerows. In the book the hero has uncovered a plot by mysterious agents of a totalitarian state, who begin zeroing in on him in the Dorset countryside. He burrows into a hedgerow and essentially becomes a part of its complex micro-life and its various wild denizens and inhabitants. The denouement is unputdownable. And it makes one want to see the great hedgerows and explore them.

Here it is in its entirety:\n\nI am gobsmacked, simply gobsmacked at how many people are complaining about  33A/D.  It seemed very ordinary a combination to me, with gentle crosses to enable the solver.\n____\n\nTo paraphrase:  I'm surprised so many people are complaining about ZEE/ZED, because I didn't find anything odd about it, and the crosses were gentle.\n\nSo you asked for more detail.\n\nI then wrote a reply that ran up close to the character limit with prolific detail.\n\nThose were my experiences.\n\nI will further elaborate that I didn't fill the answers in immediately because I wasn't certain what I was suspecting was right, which is a good tactic unless you have no other choice than to just guess things until something sticks.\n\nOnce I got the EE and the ED, the answer was obvious to me.  Had it not been obvious at that point, I'd have gone through the alphabet mentally, and gotten to \"finding the thing I was looking for in the last place I looked.\"\n\nThis is a standard crossword strategy, and even the most experienced solvers do this.\n\nWe don't consider it a big deal if in the end, the crossings were fair, and there weren't two equally valid choices (unless that was intentional; see \"Schrodinger puzzle.\")\n\nBottom line:  You relate your experience, the others their experience, and I relate mine.\n\nI was just surprised so many people were hung up in that spot.
