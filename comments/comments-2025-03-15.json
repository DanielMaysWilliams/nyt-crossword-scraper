At that point, they start passing judgment on “bad” clues (or even entire puzzles), which are almost always perfectly fine, but simply didn’t click for them in the way they’ve come to expect.\n\nWhat they don’t realize is that they have a *long* way to go on the crossword puzzle learning curve — and that, should they continue to progress along that curve, their feelings about more challenging puzzles/clues will change drastically (i.e. to the point of completely invalidating most of their earlier complaints/criticisms).\n\nFinally, this pattern has gotta be badly exacerbated by the general trend toward increasingly easy late-week puzzles — if the Friday and Saturday puzzles from 10-25 years ago were still being published, I suspect most people in the cohort described above would be much quicker to recognize the scale of the delta between their present skill level and the challenge presented by harder puzzles.\n\nIt’s truly a tale of two comments sections…","createDate":"1742048777","updateDate":"1742072007","approveDate":"1742048779","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140604448,"parentUserDisplayName":"Danielle","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140605219","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5570995211601257}
