By this time (and it was Wednesday time) I was too annoyed by the whole thing to look for my mistake so I just checked the puzzle to be done with it. I had made a typo, but I don't regret not taking my tike to spot it.\n\nBTW, Polish classified ads for real estate feature abbreviations too, but different ones, some even more arcane than the American ones, possibly. Over here traditionally not the number of bedrooms was listed but the number of rooms in general. Thus M3 meant an apartment with 3 rooms, with the M coming from \"mieszkanie\", our word for apartment. For decades M3 was standard accommodation for a typical family of parents plus two or three kids. The shortest Warsaw real estate classified ad from 30 years ago I can imagine would be something like: \"M3 Wola 75000 [phone number]\" (Wola is part of town in Warsaw).","createDate":"1739252261","updateDate":"1739331340","approveDate":"1739252263","recommendations":13,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139691405","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-11","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8297123908996582}

As Mike said, I was looking for \"blue light special\". Tho that would be just as American-centric.\n\nBig Box stores are usually built in the suburbs or outskirts of town, a big boxy building surrounded by parking, and often an array of smaller stores as satellite buildings or as part of a shopping plaza. Big box stores may be general stores like WalMart. Or they may be category-killers, in that they become almost monopolies in their product field, crowding out all the local businesses --- like Home Depot for hardware and buliding supplies, Staples for office supplies, PetSmart for pet supplies, or as Bed Bath & Beyond was for home goods.\n\nThere's a church that was built here several years ago that used commercial construction techniques, a large box framed in steel. Many locals called it the WalMart church, since that's what it looked like. The last touches of roofing, siding and landscaping finally made it look less commercial, more church-y.\n(The church members did not like being called the WalMart church.)","createDate":"1739297531","updateDate":"1739306031","approveDate":"1739297532","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139691792,"parentUserDisplayName":"John Carson","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139706508","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5817675590515137}
