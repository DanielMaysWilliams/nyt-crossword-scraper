There really isn’t such a thing and even if there was, it’s certainly not what a dentist would use to image your teeth. An X-ray machine generates x-rays that are beamed at a subject and then detected (now) digitally by an imaging plate (not a camera) that in turn creates a radiograph. The image should NOT be called an x-ray. This is one of those things that everyone gets wrong so often, it’s become standard. (Kinda like how the first annual event of something is the second time it’s occurred, not the first). \nThe only medical imaging modality that actually uses a “camera” is Nuclear Medicine, where a gamma camera (or scintillation detector) only detects and counts the light (gamma rays) being emitted by an outside source (ie the patient). Unlike an x-ray or CT machine, the gamma camera does not generate any radiation.\nI know I’m shouting into the void on this one, but let’s not perpetuate incorrect terms if we can help it.","createDate":"1747278519","updateDate":"1747311786","approveDate":"1747278520","recommendations":3,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142144173","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-14","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6538158655166626}

The English has none of the charm and uniqueness of Lem's Polish.\n\nThe Polish is understated but elegantly so: it has an almost poetic flow, and the vocabulary displays Lem's touch - he often chose less common synonyms for what he was describing. All that is completely lost in the translation.\n\nEven the subtitle is very different, stylistically. \"Electronic bard\" has nothing on Lem's Polish \"Elektrybałt\", which is pure linguistic genius. Elektry- may be understood as a prefix meaning what follows is electrical. \"Rybałt\" is an old Polish term for a travelling folk artist. The fact the \"ry\" of Elektrybałt make sense in both parts of Lem's neologism gives me a wordgasm. Also, the very inclusion of the almost ancient \"rybałt\" in a futuristic story is interesting in itself.
