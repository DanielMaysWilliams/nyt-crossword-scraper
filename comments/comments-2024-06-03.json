But today, there are ten NYT answer debuts (Hi, @Rich!) – Ten! – each by definition carrying never-before-used clues.\n\nThose debuts are in every corner as well as the middle, transforming the grid into a sea of spark. Lovely debut answers too, like BIG TIP, CHARCUTERIE, DUCK IN, and WOOD GRAIN\n\nThose debut answers plus a few I didn’t know kept me fully engaged throughout.\n\nAdding more engagement was trying to figure out the theme before uncovering the reveal, something I’m weak at and working on.  I did figure out that what connected the theme answers was BOARD (woo hoo!).  No, I didn’t get the ON THE, and I feel like I should have, but hey, small steps.\n\nBonus in this grid: Three appearances of the unusual letter string UTER, in UTERUS, CUTER, and CHARCUTERIE, not to mention CUTER crossing itself, beautifully at the T!\n\nIn sum, this puzzle, with its terrific theme and its AURA of wit and skill, kept me involved and delighted.

The name for this “dish” does not come from a Spanish term.\n\n“ The tamale, for those who don't know, is a dish of steamed corn dough, which has been popular in the Americas for thousands of years (and still is today). In Nahuatl (the language of the Aztecs) it is called tamalli, pronounced almost exactly the same as in English. (tamalli means \"something wrapped\", as the dish is usually steamed wrapped in a corn husk or banana leaves, depending on the region).\n\nThe Spanish borrowed it into their own language slightly mutated as tamal, which by normal Spanish pluralization rules is tamales. It is still known by this name by Spanish-speakers today.\n\nEnglish-speakers used their own pluralization rules, different from those of Spanish, to assume that since the plural is tamales, the singular must be tamale, mutating the word again. By doing so, they recovered the original pronunciation, purely by accident.”\n\nThere, tamale is closer to the original Aztec term than that in modern Spanish.

He came to Texas while running for president in 1976. \n\nDuring his visit to the Alamo, someone offered him a plate of tamales. He took a tamale and attempted to eat it without removing the corn husk. \n\nThere are some interesting photos of his gaffe on the internet.","createDate":"1717462074","updateDate":"1717512188","approveDate":"1717462077","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133662433,"parentUserDisplayName":"RDB","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133662909","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6854685544967651}
