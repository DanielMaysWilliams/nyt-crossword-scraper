I‚Äôve never heard of NATHANFORYOU, so it didn‚Äôt look right even at the end. I guessed NITRO, too, because living in my traditional Iberian village, trendy coffee orders are starting to pass me by.\n\nEvery time I see Toni Morrison I recall how my daughter was almost cast in the movie, Beloved.  It was the summer of 1997. I was about seven months pregnant with my daughter when, for kicks, I went to the open casting call for extras. They were unimpressed by me but very interested in my daughter. Apparently, they needed a newborn. After mulling it over with my husband, we decided that if it was a safe environment we‚Äôd do it. \n\nThe producers or casting people kept calling, checking to see if she‚Äôd been born. A few weeks after she was born (way too soon in hindsight), they had us come in for a professional photo shoot. They were surprised to see that my husband was white, and my daughter could have been straight out of NELLA Larsen‚Äôs *Passing* üòÇ. They had never asked about her likely phenotype and I never thought about it! They passed on casting her because she would not have matched the actress in the film. After the film came out, I was so relieved that my baby girl wasn‚Äôt in it! Whew üòÖ! It was fun, though.\n\nI‚Äôm starting to think that recurring entries within a week or so are NOACCIDENT.

I find that easier, in many ways. Once you've solved a cryptic clue, you generally KNOW it's right, and don't need to mess around checking with crosses. Also, because it's a sparser grid than the NYT, you're not plagued with the sort of three-letter abbreviations, nicknames, etc. that are used to provide crosses here.
