That was not a fair cross, IMO.\n\nOther than that I enjoyed the puzzle, even though Halloween means nothing to me, personally. It was unknown over here when I was a kid, and only became popular in the past 10 years or so. My wife and I value our peace, quiet and privacy highly, and our old dog gets stressed out by the doorbell, so Halloween is more of an annoyance than anything else, for me. I once put up a sign \"A sick child is sleeping, don't ring the bell\", but I can't do that every year...\n\nAlso, interestingly, there is Catholic pushback against the \"pagan\" Halloween over here (and many other things, too...). To let kids dress up for the season, some Catholics organize All Saints parades, where kids dress up as saints, as a supposed counterbalance to all the ghouls, zombies and vampires. Too bad we don't have children because we would have our kid become St. Bartholomew, dripping blood off exposed muscle, with his own flayed skin in his hands, or St. Lucy with her gouged out eyes on a platter, her eye sockets gory.","createDate":"1730277752","updateDate":"1730359549","approveDate":"1730277755","recommendations":28,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137215403","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6146831512451172}

That answer becomes a TIL, and it’s  sweet to learn new things.  Also, making the unknowable gettable is evidence of artful construction and editing, and brushes with excellence always bring me joy.  \n\nToday, the entire theme was out of my wheelhouse, as I’ve never seen any production of the Beetlejuice franchise (though I’m familiar with the character through ads).  Yet it easily filled in, and I learned a delightful aspect of the story.  Thus, much happy-button-ness.\n\nFiguring out the circled letter aspect, and appreciating the skill behind making that happen was icing on the cake.\n\nI loved the middle-of-the-grid crossing of two lovely words, INDULGENT and OTOLOGY.  I liked seeing ETO, which used to be a crossword staple, but hasn’t appeared in the Times puzzle in more than a year (is someone who studies this answer an etologist?).  I also liked seeing jaunty words CHUM and JEST as neighbors.\n\nLots of pleasure in this one for me.

Here the Early Voting process is exactly the same as voting in person on Election Day, same process, same machines.   What is interesting is that the 9 days are considered a single day with respect to closing the poll.  The machines and poll \"books\" are not closed until the end of the day on this coming Sunday.  \n\nThe rooms are locked and secured each night until the poll opens the next morning.
