Aluminum is the third most abundant element in earth's crust and the most common metal, but it's rarely found in its pure form, it must be refined from its ORE -- mainly found in bauxite, and the greatest abundance of bauxite in the western hemisphere is in Brazil: early on Alcoa established bauxite mines in Suriname and Brazil. Bauxite was then refined, producing aluminum hydroxide, which was then smelted in an electrolytic process to produce aluminum. And its byproducts do indeed include quite a bit of SLAG.

By now I (as, I’m sure, most regulars) have come to mechanically start typing EROICA when I spot the words “Beethoven” and “symphony” in the same clue. And though this isn’t the first time that the piece’s original dedication to Napoleon has come up, I’ve been thinking a lot about the legend of Beethoven angrily scratching the name “Bonaparte” out of the symphony’s manuscript as soon as he heard the French statesman had crowned himself emperor. \n\nThe Napoleon dedication was part of a larger Promethean theme (both musically and ideologically) B had been developing. He saw Napoleon as the hero who was willing to run afoul of the aristocratic Olympus to give humanity the gift of the republic. (In fact, he was kind of obsessed with these heroic notions throughout his middle period.)\n\nThe point is: in the thick of his thirst for a hero to lionize, Beethoven realized his republican idol was just another greedy mortal and flew into a rage. He grieved. \n\nWhy does this idea seem so farcical now, when time and again it is made clear that Trump is not some hero bent on freeing the masses from the oppressive ancien régime, and every time his supporters’ reaction is to pretend they never wanted the republic to begin with?

I remember a scene in a TV show called \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\" A young man is on a vision quest. He isn't supposed to move or eat or drink, etc. He is sitting cross-legged in a field and a herd of stampeding buffalo rushes past all around him! He doesn't flinch.\n\nBy the way, I've read that buffalo are actually very fast runners.\n\nAlso by the way, for those who don't know, the Amish rite of passage allows teens to run off and go to the city and carouse and do what they want, I believe, and then they come back to the community and follow the strict Amish ways, I guess. Or not.\n\nMargaret Mead describes a similar situation in her famous book \"Coming of Age in Samoa.\" The teens have a special \"bunk\" they live in and live it up, and then later adopt the routine ways of their group.","createDate":"1770219685","updateDate":"1770231633","approveDate":"1770219687","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148625344,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148628370","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6866626143455505}

I found some of this puzzle somewhat difficult because I’m not American, have never watched a lot of tv or movies, don’t listen to pop music, and don’t follow sports (US or otherwise).\n\nA co-worker of mine easily solved those clues, because he is a walking encyclopedia of pop culture are US sports knowledge, whereas he couldn’t name the primary belligerents in WW2. He can’t point to Spain on an unmarked map. He knows nothing about music recorded prior to about 1998, let alone basic music theory. Has never read a single book, let alone anything that could be classified as literature or a “classic”. Can recite the menu of every fast food chain in the US or Canada, drinks a six pack of soda per day, but otherwise knows nothing about food or cuisine.\n\nIn the context of playing a game like a crossword puzzle, all knowledge has equal weight.

I have no issue with pop culture, and I am no kind of elitist. I knew the Seinfeld reference as well, can also quote most of the Princess Bride, and most of the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons to boot (I’m a gen Xer). I wouldn’t be able to function very well socially if I didn’t have some baseline knowledge of pop culture. For better or worse, it binds us like shared experiences and shapes our collective consciousness.\n\nMy specific argument was that having a deep knowledge of pop culture and nothing else is an issue. I would even argue that if a person was utterly ignorant of other forms of knowledge (for instance, history or science), they would be better to have no knowledge of pop culture at all, as they would lack the framework to parse that flood of unfiltered content. Pop culture doesn’t demand any great degree of critical thinking from us, only that we consume it - which is absolutely fine when it’s consumed as a diversion. Pop culture is to society as junk food is to nutrition.\n\nThe exception I took with the OP’s post was his implication that crosswords should be above pop culture knowledge. But I do agree with his view that the glorification of pop culture is detrimental to our society. Our memories and time both being in limited supply means that for most of us, the more of that kind of knowledge we retain, the less of everything else there will be.","createDate":"1770251693","updateDate":"1770265991","approveDate":"1770251693","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148643569,"parentUserDisplayName":"Endall","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148645478","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5147791504859924}

Your first message read (to me) like you consider this glorification of pop culture (and people like your co-worker) to currently be a huge problem in our societies, and I personally don't see that being the case.\n\nHonestly, I don't always know what pop culture is really supposed to include. I mean, as Grant mentioned above, Shakespeare was once pop culture. Probably a lot of the arts were or are, but there's a depth of understanding of humanity and beauty to be learned through them that is as worthy as the other types of knowledge. We see it not as trivial now, who knows what will stand the test of time and importance over the next generations. \n\nAnyhow, I appreciate your clarification.
