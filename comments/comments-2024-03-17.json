Instead, I got swept up reading everyone else's reactions! On more than one occasion during the day... and into the night, haha.\n\nSo yeah, I *loved* this puzzle. Not grokking the revealer while solving didn't bother me (not an unusual occurrence for me). But I did \"clue in\" to the theme once I had two quadrants, and it really helped me with the rest! Especially in the SW.\n\nThere's so much great wordplay all around the grid, and I live for that, crossword-wise! With a few assists from my partner -- I could picture Jimmy Durante, but had \"tina\" instead of the clever, hidden-lowercase DIAL, for instance -- this was a flowing, super smooth solve. Caught the wave, and the wavelength! I definitely added to my overall time, though, because I kept admiring the visual balance of the themers each time 69A caused them all to light up. Beautiful. \n\nA few less mentioned faves: Loved the clue \"Short hedge?\", which I first filled with SELL, like stocks... Also the academic wordplay for STUDENTS and CRAYONS... Even the clues for OUTDO and STIRRER, both of which had me overthinking, haha. \n\nI'm reaching the character limit, so I'll leave it at that -- but there were many more fills that made the *entire* puzzle a joy!!","createDate":"1710773567","updateDate":"1711257914","approveDate":"1710773570","recommendations":8,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131925437","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-17","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9780945181846619}
