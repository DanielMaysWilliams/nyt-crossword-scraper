One: crosswords are more about knowing the constructor than knowing wordplay. Two: crosswords are, objectively, always about the same difficulty. That is, if you compared a crossword from 1980 to 1990 to 2000 to 2025 you would find that they require about the same knowledge of current events, about the same knowledge of pop culture, etc.\n\nIf you keep doing one publication's XW, it's going to get disproportionately easier because 1. you learn their quirks (the NYT has put more OREOs into more different types of food than an unsupervised toddler) and 2. you learn what would otherwise be inaccessible pop culture/historical. I don't listen to DUA LIPA or play FORTNITE, but I know that the Gray Lady does.\n\nOn a good Monday I can finish in under 3 minutes. This is not because I am smart (I am not smart). Spelling Bee takes me forever, if I do it, but I am almost positive that's because I don't play it very often. That, in turn, means I haven't built up my knowledge of what bizarre words the constructor thinks are valid, and which ones they don't, and I get frustrated as a result :P\n\nIt could also be that the clues have trends, and we're in (e.g.) a period where more of them are about football teams or poetic contractions or something that you happen to be more familiar with, and they will become harder when the next \"actors from TV shows you haven't seen\" cycle hits.","createDate":"1771067635","updateDate":"1771097780","approveDate":"1771067635","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148888814,"parentUserDisplayName":"K Barrett","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148889456","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.734352707862854}
