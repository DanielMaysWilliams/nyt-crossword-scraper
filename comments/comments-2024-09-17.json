Over the years I've learned a lot about eels from the clues here. This week I learned that no-one knows much about their erotic or procreative life, and today I learned that they are nocturnal. That gives them all day to fool around somewhere private, away from those eelers (whose erotic life also remains somewhat of a mystery). There's a bar not far from where I live called Nooners. It attracts a certain clientele and repels everybody else.  A place like that is where I would look for eels on the make, if I were an eelologist. Eels probably look for that spark of electricity between them, or maybe I'm projecting. I read somewhere that Freud in his student days dissected hundreds of eels in a search for their male sex organs. That doesn't seem to rank high on a list of his achievements, but we did learn from him that the Naughty and Nice are the same people; the nice people suppress their naughty side & are the unhappier for it; and vice versa -- the trick is to be naughty AND nice, isn't that Freud 101? Asking for an eel. \n\nBack to this fine debut.  I like the northerly vibe of ICE WINE (which is, yes, TOO SWEET for the likes of me -- plus one for that cross!), the INUK, the NHL'ers deking away -- our Mario Lemieux was perhaps the finest deker I've ever seen, he could deke the tennis shoes off an eel.

The excitement.\n\nThis is not a going-through-the-motions puzzle, as one might expect after 39 rejections.  The theme has spark, with each theme answer a riddle in its own right, so I was motivated throughout, taking stabs and feeling quite satisfied when I figured one out with few crosses.  The theme clues/answers brought me smiles. Lovely answers deepened the solving pleasure – GO LONG, TOOK PAINS, CUE TIPS, CULT FILMS.\n\nThis is not just another grid – it has a bold look without scattershot black squares, and it has never appeared before in the Times.  At 72 words and 34 blocks it is more Thursday/Friday than Tuesday, yet still works because the theme, cluing, and answer set are Tuesday.\n\nHoward, I am inspired by your persistence, your continuing to tell yourself, “Okay, I’ll find another way,” until you reached success.

I never thought that to be exclusively the case. Just last night, the Mets’ second baseman (or maybe shortstop) deked a runner going to second that he caught the ball thrown to him, so the runner didn’t get up and advance to third.
