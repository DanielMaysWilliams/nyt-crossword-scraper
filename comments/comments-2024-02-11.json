To me, crosswordese consists of words that are both (a) not commonly used in everyday conversation or writing, and also (b) commonly found in crossword puzzles (mostly due to their common letters).\n\nREPINE has only appeared 27 times, and only eight of those have been in the Shortz Era.  In fact, its last appearance was a dozen years ago.  Half a dozen for the time before that.\n\nEugene Maleska only used it three times, and Will Weng just twice.  Weng waited almost a decade to use it for the first time.  The first editor, Margaret Farrar, used it 14 times between 1942 and 1965.\n\nSo it would seem to me that it might have been crosswordese (although marginally so) 60 or 70 years ago, but it hardly seems like crosswordese today.  \n\nTo me, it just seems like a rare word that finally found its way back into a puzzle.

Myers, with Henry Ford's home nearby.  The main house was large and rickety, with a big porch and airy rooms, windows open to the elements, . There was much to look at, his inventions and memorabilia, his associations with other luminaries* (woohoo!) of the time -- but I began to notice dozens of lizards, perched alertly on desk tops,  scampering up the walls, and one peering down at us from the top of a four-poster bed, mainly brown and green anoles, though our older son spotted iguanas as well. No one seemed to mind them much, least of all the docents, but it was so at odds with modern museum conservation practices that I  was somewhat shocked (woohoo!), and could well imagine Edison getting on one of his Spirit Phones and barking out orders to get rid of the cussed things, why, what's the use of displaying his greatest invention, the Ionic Anoliator if they didn't use it once in a while for the good of humankind?!?! \n\nSo glad this wasn't a Super Bowl trivia fest! Speaking of which, did you know Edison tested 1600 kinds of filaments (coconut strands, carbonized cotton thread, hair) before settling on carbonized bamboo?

SSE (that's sur-sur-ESTE) from SANDUSKY, Ohio. His family lived there until he was seven, at which point they moved to Port Huron, Mich. It's a big deal in that part of Ohio: There's an Edison Woods Metropark, Milan and the neighboring Berlin Hts. share in the Edison Local School System, and the Edison Bridge crosses beautiful Sandusky Bay, connecting the \"mainland\" with the Marblehead Penninsula.\n\nAnd of course, his family's home has been turned into the Edison Birthplace Museum, but nowhere near as scary as the one in West Orange, NJ, as the Johns can tell you:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN6uZ5gJWdk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN6uZ5gJWdk</a>\n(I can't believe I'm the first one to post this today!)","createDate":"1707687189","updateDate":"1707867565","approveDate":"1707687192","recommendations":7,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131101801","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7297943234443665}

As with the account of the creation in Genesis, everything else follows from it.  The clue to 72D refers to an “American icon,” and Peter Koetter’s grid is iconic of the Menlo Park wizard’s achievement, with the light bulb at its center, and his other inventions positioned around it like the planets orbiting the sun.\n \n66D: SPIRITPHONE --  a 1920 project that didn’t quite pan out (one wag called it his “dial-a-ghost machine”) --  might give the impression that he dabbled in mysticism. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. Edison gave a lengthy interview to the NY Times in 1910, which still makes fascinating reading. “Searching the inner structure of all things for the fundamental,” the interviewer notes, “Edison told me he had come to the conclusion that there is no ‘supernatural’ or ‘supernormal’ as the psychic researchers put it – that all there is, that all there has been, all there ever will be, can or will, soon or late, be explained along material lines.” \n\nThe full interview is available on TimesMachine:\n\" NO IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL\" SAYS THOMAS A.
