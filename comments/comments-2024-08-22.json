Sure, it's thousands of miles away and not even on the Arabian Peninsula, but I guess you can do that sort of thing when you're the Sultan.

I enjoyed the solve so much, so thank you thank you, Brad! I guess one of the reasons I liked it so much is that I figured out what was going on pretty early. I had filled in several of the Downs in the top, being old enough to remember ERROL Flynn, then getting PIANO easily, and also getting DAD quickly‚Äîmaybe because of how much I‚Äôve been watching Dem‚Äôs convention and being reminded of the presidential numbers? \nSo after initially thinking the bold letters at the beginning of theme clues had something to do with the periodic table, I soon saw that wasn‚Äôt the case, and happily got 17A.  \nOne of my favorite spots was GNUS, because it reminded me of that wonderful old song, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm A Gnu‚Äù. Back when my husband and I were living in Highgate, London, for his job, in the early 1980s, and all of our family music was on vinyl, we had a record called ‚ÄúAll Aboard‚Äù and we listened to it constantly with our young daughters. I just looked it up and see it‚Äôs available on You Tube and various other sites. Clearly it was and maybe still is, popular. Besides the ‚ÄúGnu‚Äù song, by Flanders and Swann, there was the hilarious ‚ÄúLaughing Policeman‚Äù. (I could go on but I‚Äôll spare you.) \nWhen our grandsons were younger (they are teenagers now) it was their favorite thing to listen to in the car. Lovely memories.

My implement of choice is a NEOLITH (really!), an approximately 6000-year-old black flint hammerstone I stumbled across while walking along the margin of a plowed field in Essex, U.K. Crafted from a flint nodule taken from the local chalk formation, this was someone's go-to tool in Neolithic England.\n\nA modern option that works well is to slowly squeeze the nuts in a heavy vise until the shells succumb to the pressure. In any case, forget using a typical nutcracker.\n\nAn additional caution regarding that \"thick, rubbery green rind\"---when bruised or cut it exudes a \"juice\" that will stain your skin (and everything else) yellow-brown. The stain will last for a week or more---unless you are willing to remove several layers of skin!

I've seen maybe one or two operas in my life, and never Orfeo, but it's one of those titles that surfaces regularly in crosswords. Orpheus in the myth is a musician, so naturally, it's a story that lends itself to opera, film, and musical theater (\"Hadestown\"), set in New Orleans in the 1920s.
