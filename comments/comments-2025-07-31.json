Every day I sprayed my solution over all door and window frames, plus the kitchen work tops. I put cotton pads soaked in it in each cupboard. I found the main entry points because of the number of ants milling around. I’m told the vinegar effectively ‘blinds’ them as they can’t smell the pheromones and find their way out. It took about a week to shift them, but they were gone. I did it every year when I first spotted them and got the same result.\n\nSince I tried to post the first time I realised (I think) why I don’t  get ants in my current home. They were all over the kitchen the first year; I repeated the vinegar and got rid of them. Then I switched cleaning products to a natural, essential oil based one, primarily because we’re not on mains sewage out here. Never had ants in since. I know they’re all over the terrace and gardens as the little devils have a mean bite, but they no longer come in.  \n\nDon’t know if that’s any help, but good luck.","createDate":"1753982927","updateDate":"1753995258","approveDate":"1753982929","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143931786,"parentUserDisplayName":"Helen Wright","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143942875","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4919346868991852}
