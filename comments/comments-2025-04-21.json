I did not get it until the revealer and afterwards did my own sneeze reading the AH AH AH CHOO in my head.  That was really nice.\n\nWhat I enjoyed less about this puzzle was the construction.  I think it was a mistake to put blocks of 4 at the ends of the center row.  Not only did that segment the puzzle, but it made for tougher fill that was not as snazzy or interesting.  Stacks of 7 are tough to work with and usually not as lively.  With a center word at just 7 letters, you can eliminate 3 of the 4 blocks which gets rid of those stacks, and then you can have some fun, longer downs to boot.\n\nBecause of that choice in the center, this was a noticeably harder puzzle than a typical Monday.

Ikea's appeal is that you can get all the stuff you need for your home in one place - furniture, cutlery, potted plants, lighting, rugs, etc., etc. They also have a wide selection of individual types of items (40 different sofas, 60 chairs, etc.), so most people will find what they are looking for there - in the end, anyway, as navigating the place is nightmare when you want a specific thing (there are floorplans, and you can take shortcuts, but it's still quite inconvenient). For people who want to fill two (or five) huge shopping carts with a whole selection of household items, it is perfect.\n\nMost Polish homes feature loads of Ikea stuff. Much of it is locally made, too (Poland is a furniture manufacturing powerhouse), which keeps costs low.\n\nAt this stage in life I prefer high quality, designer furniture though (new or vintage) so I avoid Ikea - but I shopped there gladly 15 or 20 years ago, when I was not as privileged as I am now.\n\nThat song... I'm so glad my life with my wife is nothing like that :D\n\nBTW, I think I really do need that break from these puzzles I've been hinting at recently.

And yeah, seeing one hit by a sudden gust is impressive.\n\nFortunately, the large size of the individual particles of their pollen means they don't provoke hay fever, which is why you can actually be in the South during springtime and not die.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, most of those pines are in the southern half of the state, but as far north as Atlanta you still sometimes have to clear all the pine pollen off your car glass before you can drive.","createDate":"1745249767","updateDate":"1745266395","approveDate":"1745249768","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141591889,"parentUserDisplayName":"Marshall Walthew","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141597394","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5503179430961609}
