Can anyone tell me the meaning of Easter?\"\n\nA girl in a fancy Easter dress raised her hand confidently. \"Easter,\" she said tentatively, \"is the day when we remember that Jesus died on the cross for our sins.

The first themed clue was a gimme, but the other two were not. I actually grew annoyed: \"%@$@$ trivia-based themes!\" I thought.\n\nNow, the fill, extremely straightforward in the upper third of the puzzle, began to give me (minor) trouble in the lower two thirds. In fact, I was forced to take a step back and look at the grid as a whole - and then I was struck by the realization of the repetitive theme. Wow! To be surprised? On a Monday, of all days? That was quite something!\n\nWhat's most important, to me, is that I still solved in quite typical Monday time. I really don't enjoy toughened-up Mondays (I consider those a betrayal of solver-constructor-editor trust) - happily this wasn't one, and yet I found it unusual. Very cool.\n\nI also liked the somewhat perverse clue for SOLO. I find duets kind of special. Taking away one of the performers in a duet changes everything. Mathematically the result may be a solo, but artistically it is a complete transformation. I love it when math, my nemesis, fails to describe what's happening in any sense that matters to living, breathing people 🤣\n\n(If you find the final paragraph confusing, I don't blame you - the ramblings of Andrzej are often understood by him only. I would have expressed it better in Polish...)","createDate":"1770012535","updateDate":"1770092390","approveDate":"1770012536","recommendations":32,"replyCount":18,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148554501","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5212606191635132}

The surge reached Saint-Pierre at 8:02 a.m. Escape from the city was virtually impossible. Almost everyone within the city proper—about 28,000 people—died, burned or were buried by falling masonry. The hot ash ignited a firestorm, fueled by smashed buildings and countless casks of rum. One survivor within the city was a prisoner (Ludger Sylbaris) who was locked in a windowless underground jail cell, later being discovered by rescue workers.[4] The only other survivors were a few tens of people caught within the margins of the cloud, who were all badly burned.[3]","createDate":"1770049180","updateDate":"1770085038","approveDate":"1770049181","recommendations":3,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148564087","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9220802783966064}

A British-style one, also called a cryptic, has more of a checkerboard pattern; not every letter has a cross.  Here's an example of a cryptic:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/29919\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/29919</a>\n\nCryptics are called that because the clues are made up of a definition part and a wordplay part.  The combinations used require a lot of getting used to.  They involve anagrams, homonyms, reversing the letters, etc. Here are some examples:\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword#Clueing_techniques\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword#Clueing_techniques</a>\n\nIt all looks convoluted, but you eventually figure out what the signal words are, and what they signal. (\"About\" means one word surrounds another, \"rising\" means write the letters up [in a down answer.])\n\nThe NYT also runs cryptics as the second Sunday puzzle about once every two months, alternating with the acrostic, which appears every other week, and a variety of other puzzles.  They are not available on the NYT site or app, only the print edition, but xwordinfo.com has a playable version of these puzzles on their site.  Unfortunately, you have to be a member (not that expensive), and also, you cannot solve on mobile devices.\n\nI once tried a few cryptics a while back just to see if I could do them.  I found that with a little effort to understand how they work, I could, but I didn't like the experience, so I never did them again.\n\nHope this helps!","createDate":"1770001706","updateDate":"1770081469","approveDate":"1770001710","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148552818,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nina","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148553806","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.838151752948761}

It's a pity one can't appreciate my simple yet refined style without actually speaking Polish...\n\nMathematically speaking, a duo minus one person is a solo performance. However, the mathematics of this calculation in no way reflects what the listener feels when listening to a piece performed by a duo or a solo artist. The emotional and artistic dialogue between a pair of singers creates a value that goes beyond simple arithmetic – what the listener experiences is not only related to the music and singing itself, but also to the relationship between the performers. Is it real or just created for the purposes of the song? Is it a duel, or perhaps an act of symbiosis, the effect of which goes beyond anything that can be achieved solo? The answers to these questions – different for different listeners, yet true without exception, as art allows, though mathematics does not – cannot be expressed in numbers and mathematical symbols.","createDate":"1770029282","updateDate":"1770100102","approveDate":"1770029283","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148554501,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148555238","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5429830551147461}
