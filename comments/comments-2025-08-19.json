Swaths splat in, the puzzle finishes, and while my brain enjoyed keeping in practice, it never got excited.\n\nMy brain likes to riddle-crack, to be thrust into a problems that force it to devise possibilities, to unearth connections, to gather different meanings for words, to suddenly see the blanks between crosses. This is what galvanizes my brain.\n\nAnd today, right from the start, my brain perked up, and before long, it was yessing.  There were vague clues, no-knows, wordplay clues, a theme to crack, clues with humor. \n\nI left the revealer blank, didn't even look at its clue, and tried to guess it, knowing at that point that it would include CRIB.  And even though I didn’t get it – I never heard of the show – the effort was more balm for my brain.\n\nThen there was the bonus of a rare-in-crosswords five-letter semordnilap (SNIPS).\n\nThank you, Eric, for this, for taking my brain from lethargy to happy dance.  More please!","createDate":"1755604038","updateDate":"1755666698","approveDate":"1755604040","recommendations":24,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144372867","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6346530318260193}
