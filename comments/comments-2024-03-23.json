I manage to finish them, but I don't enjoy the process. I've been trying to figure out why. I think it has something to do with his particular kind of vagueness--useful in clueing, of course, especially on a Saturday. GAH, to me, doesn't work for [Smacks forehead]; GAH carries a connotation of horror and panic (unlike the more apt-for-the-clue DOH). ALL THAT has a more negative connotation than \"Legit,\" in my experience (as in \"He thinks he's all that\"), and glances are what one typically steals, rather than PEEKs. Perhaps that's it: Sam's clues tend to strip words of their connotations and common usages, so I don't get that rush of pleasure from \"Oh! I never thought of that word that way!\" Instead, the answers often feel just shy of correct to me--arguably correct, perhaps, but I don't look for arguments first thing in the morning on a Saturday.","createDate":"1711199976","updateDate":"1722797567","approveDate":"1711199978","recommendations":121,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132041748","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-23","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8162529468536377}

Still, I’m deeply interested in the perpetual debate in these comments about what’s fair game in terms of criticism, and because that issue was sparked by Thursday’s Wordplay column but also comes up again today (as it does with any difficult puzzle that people complain about when they can’t finish it), it still feels salient.\n\nSo, on the theory of “better late than never,” here goes:\n\nFirst, kudos to @Deb Amlen for being willing to buck the convention that the column must only say nice things about the puzzle. I thought it was enormously refreshing to read her piece. To me, it modeled constructive criticism: she acknowledged that she was expressing her own opinion (rather than an objective Truth about the puzzle’s quality) and she explained why she thought it fell short. The fact that there was so much blowback, to me, was more a function of how rare such gentle criticism is (and therefore how “out of character” it was) rather than being justified by what she actually wrote. In particular, calling it a “diatribe” as some did was ridiculous. \n\nSecond: While I wanted to share my view, I could have saved space by just writing: What @Tito said (in yesterday’s comment section).\n\nThanks to @Deb and the whole Wordplay crew for providing and maintaining this space and for stimulating discussion every day.","createDate":"1711202258","updateDate":"1711295695","approveDate":"1711202260","recommendations":27,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132042421","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5414905548095703}

Weirdly his attitude is reminiscent of Eugene Maleska's. who was famously off-putting for his obscure vocabulary and assumption of an elitist body of knowledge.

And most of crosswords is other stuff.\n\nBut don't say \"never in a million years\".  In the 80s, I would never have been able to solve a puzzle like this one.  But I can now.  And that's just 40 years.  (Actually, I have been solving consistently for about half that time.)\n\nThey say it takes 10,000 hours to get good at something.  Assuming an hour a puzzle, that's about 27 years.

If we wrote puzzles in a similar spirit, I imagine the resultts would be just as tortured and offputting.  But we don't have editors or experience, at least I don't.  That's why, in my view, this is a fail and I expect more from the NY Times.  Every year there are a few clunkers and I guess that is to be expected.  But when I think about it, I never felt that way before, only in the last few years.  Though I love steak, I have never heard of an 'ambassador cut' or knew or even care that Beale Street has a music festival.  I was able to guess Beale, but I derive no satisfaction or interest from doing so.  I got lira—Turkey bacon?  how lame— and damask ('I have seen roses damasked, red and white, / but no such roses do i see in her cheeks').  Doesn't mean I think the latter should show up in a puzzle.  I always remember the scene from the Will Shortz movie about crosswords in which one of the constructors looks up a word in the dictionary to make sure it is legit.  If he doesn't know the word, why should anyone else?  That is just a bad puzzle.

For downs, even fewer: just “pho” and “tuo”.\n\nIt seems that many people think that a sea of blanks after a first pass is a sign of a bad puzzle.

Like many, I was not happy with “abbas” as clued, but it was clear that was what should be there. Never heard of Trace Adkins or Geno Smith, but they were both more than fairly crossed and clued.\n\nSaturday NYT puzzles are celebrated for the challenge.

Lots of reasons you might not like a puzzle but calling it “garbage” is uncalled for. \nSecond, FYI, puzzles are accepted months and months in advance so I have little doubt Will Shortz approved this puzzle. Occasional tweaks on clues at the last minute, yes, but the grid itself, unlikely. And Sam the constructor is also an editor so I doubt there would have been much different if Will were here.\nThird, Sam’s contributed lots of puzzles and this is his style, like it or not. Exasperating, stretchy, sometimes obscure but in my opinion usually entertaining and thought-provoking. Don’t agree?

Why can't we use, for example, *my* personal level of comfort? I finished this puzzle in 17 minutes and 32 seconds, no lookups. What if I think it was far too easy for a Saturday? What if I feel \"put off\" by the simplicity of a puzzle that's supposed to be challenging? Can we go by my standard instead of yours? I'd argue yours is no more valid than mine, so why not?","createDate":"1711213652","updateDate":"1711413811","approveDate":"1711213654","recommendations":17,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132045854,"parentUserDisplayName":"David Connell","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132046861","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-23","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.51420658826828}
