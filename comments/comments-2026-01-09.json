Each one hit hard. So hard. In my 30s, we lost one dog to a protracted battle with cancer. I’ve always loved all our dogs, but this one—she was special. When she died, I didn’t know what to do with myself. Our surviving dog, he was just a simple guy without complex emotions. He neither really mourned her, nor was he able to have the same kind of Vulcan mind melt with me that she and I had had. He just went on with his uncomplicated doggie life. For a long time I both missed her unbearably and felt guilty that I was robbing him of focusing all my love solely on him. I’d cry for her and my husband would say (like something out of a movie), “You can’t forget that you still have Rufie.” But time went on and, even though my relationship with him was different, it became just as important. When it was his turn to go a few years later, I was just as destroyed as I’d been after his “big sister.”\n\nAnd then I found The Dog in the middle of the Turquoise Trail 8 months later, and a new dog love story began… :)\n\nThere’s no wrong way to love Lucek. And you haven’t done a disservice to either him or to Jorge’s memory by bringing him into your family.

For really big things like planets, gravity within the planet is so strong that the resulting shape is a sphere. So that means that gravity will make it solid, too. It smushes everything together into a ball. \n\nAs for the bubbling, magma is under a lot of pressure until it comes to the surface.

I very much get the concept of not wanting a permanent relationship—when I met my husband, I was just finishing grad school; I had zero thoughts of marriage or living with someone or even a committed relationship. Besides, I’m the last person to judge someone else’s personal choices. I’m only saying that for me, personally, back when I dated, I couldn’t commit to any man for any length of time unless he was my everything. I had met a couple of such men, but then the relationships had run their course and we broke up—amicably, but, like you, with sadness. I suppose I’m  rather an all-or-nothing kind of person. \n\nI do think, however, that ‘Mr. Right Now’ is dismissive. And not just toward men: The very existence of the term presupposes that all women are looking for Mr. Right, which feels rather 1950s-ish. \n\nOver Christmas, I was invited into the kids’ room to play with dolls. Barbie didn’t have Ken, but there was a Ron (from Harry Potter). While I allowed Ron to cook Barbie a nice candlelight dinner and draw her a bath, I set up Barbie with her feet up on the sofa, laptop in hand, surrounded by books, mountain-climbing gear, and her go bag. I made sure my nieces thrice-removed knew that in my book Barbie needed to be the hero of her own story. \n\n@Andrzej\n\nExactly.

We’d visit up there, and all his cousins and aunts and old high school friends that I’d meet would be climbers. One summer, they talked me into putting on the gear and getting up on a rock wall up in the Catskills. Well, they ended up having to resolve a… uh… treed-cat situation. I froze. Completely.

One of castles in the link looked familiar and I think I may have seen it when I went driving across Northern and Eastern Europe with some colleagues from a summer seminar we did back in the late 90s. We drove through Poland, too, which as I recall was still relatively new to its democratic era, so Bloody Marys were inexpensive and served in fantastic places, and out in the countryside the road was open, beautiful, and populated by folks who were amazingly helpful with directions even when they didn’t speak a lick of English (or our newly acquired Old Slavonic). In Poland, like in Slovakia, Romania, etc., we hiked up to deserted castle ruins with no one around. The experience was to die for. \n\nThis is limestone, right? And I see online you have plenty of granite in Poland, too. I remember how disappointed my boyfriend’s climbing buddies were that all the exotic rock formations in Utah weren’t climber-friendly: It’s all\nsandstone. \n\nI do believe you that folks can overcome vertigo, and I know climbing is great exercise, but… nuh-uh.
