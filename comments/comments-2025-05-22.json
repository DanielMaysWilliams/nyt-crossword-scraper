However, I needed help in the SE corner.\n\nEven though I understood the theme, I did not know the currency of Costa Rica.

DEDE (what kind of name is that?) Allen was a mystery, too. I would never have figured out \"That's the pits!\" (a phrase I understand) solves to UGH. The clues for RETITLE, UTILIZED and HES, especially, were just not on my wavelength. Also, it appears I will never remember who takes which American exam. I *know* GRE is an exam, but not who it is for.\n\nSo yeah, I looked up the president, the editor, and I checked the column for GRE and RETITLE - that gave me crosses to deal with the rest of the SE section on my own.\n\nThe crossing of T_EBO and SB_ was cruel for me, too, but suddenly TAEBO dawned on me - I must have seen it here before.\n\nAlso, MINOR IN I only got because of the years of contact with American culture. Over here we do it differently. All courses have a major focus. Students take many classes outside this main focus, too, but they may be all over the place. For example, a management student can take classes in singing, geography, art, and philosophy. These additional classes don't constitute a coherent, minor focus of the person's studies.
