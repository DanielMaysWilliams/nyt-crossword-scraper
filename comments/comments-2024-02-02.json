However, I don't think of actors when I think of MONOLOGUE; to me, that's a soliloquy.  MONOLOGUEs are the province of comics and late-night hosts.\n\nIN ECSTASY does mean \"Sky-high\", but it didn't come to mind without several crosses.  And it didn't help that one of them was ENMITY, when I had guessed ANIMUS.  And I'M DONE off just the Doc's D and the N of NATS was a fortunate guess.  Never heard of the Isle of ELY, although I have heard of Ron ELY, who played Tarzan a long time ago.\n\nElsewhere, I opted for ASTA where it was supposed to be TOTO, but TOGO put me right.  (And TOGO, too??)  \n\nOf course, like probably everyone else (especially those who had the B from NBC already), John and Paul were BEATLES, not BUNYANS.  I wasn't familiar with John BUNYAN, and seems to me to be rather obscure.\n\nMYRA, MY SHARONA and PURIM might be very obscure for some, but they were gimmes for me.\n\nAll told, it seemed pretty challenging for a Friday, but a good, solid workout.","createDate":"1706844686","updateDate":"1706913468","approveDate":"1706844689","recommendations":13,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130882735","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7714214324951172}
