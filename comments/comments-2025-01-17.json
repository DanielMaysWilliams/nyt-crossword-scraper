It had lots of twisty clues and plenty of fresh fill.  It took me awhile to get going, but I picked up speed as I went along.  The app generously added 17 minutes to my solve time, at least that’s better than the 3 hours it added a couple of weeks ago.  The timing has become so erratic that I can’t use the stats to judge how I’m doing against my norms.  I don’t solve for speed anyway, but I did like having a gauge as to how I finished a puzzle vis a vis my usual performance.  Oh well.\n\nI don’t often quibble with clues, but, as a birder, I’m not familiar with any buff colored EGRETs.  The snowy, great and cattle EGRETs are pretty bright white, and the reddish egret is not buff either.  Anyway, if there is a buff EGRET outside the US, I haven’t seen one, and I’ll stand corrected.\n\nI was delighted to see Kenneth GRAHAME pop up in the puzzle, and he would have been one of my early footholds, if, that is, I’d remembered how to spell his name.  I was only confident enough to enter the GRA until I had some crosses.  The Wind In The Willows was one of my favorite childhood books.  Mole rediscovering his old home always brings a tear of nostalgia to my eye and the Piper At The Gates Of Dawn chapter is one of the most lyrical episodes in all of children’s literature, and one of the best descriptions of a mystical experience in any literature.  I look forward to reading it again with my grandson, and it may break my heart if he doesn’t share my enthusiasm.","createDate":"1737085407","updateDate":"1737180383","approveDate":"1737085408","recommendations":40,"replyCount":15,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139060554","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-17","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9124361872673035}

Wit that misdirected, wit that tickled.\n\nLook at [Exchange letters] for IPO.  Its lovely double meaning misdirected me for a bit (and I find something very satisfying about being fooled through wordplay).  It’s an original clue for an answer that has appeared more than 400 times in the major crossword venues.  \n\nLook at [Big whoop] for YELL, which triggered a smile.  Once again, here’s an answer that has shown up more than 200 times, sometimes clued as [Whoop], but never with the “big”, which, IMO, makes it infinitely better.\n\nLook at the lovely misdirect [Hint] for NOTE, another never-before-used clue for an answer that has turned up more than 400 times in Crosslandia.   \n\nAnd there were quite a bit more that Willa came up with.\n\nOh, I loved setting down the beautiful SHARDS, as well as the lovely PuzzPair© of ERAS and a backward AGES.\n\nBut what’s going to spark joy when I see your name atop another puzzle, Willa, is the thought of entering another word playground.

Going through those pre-Shortz puzzles, the way they are displayed makes it easy to miss some.\n\nThat's not a complaint, I was happy to see that they had them out there. I wasn't sure but wanted to see since it's such a compelling memory for Jay. So, I went poking around, but the way you have to scroll past each day within each month for those old ones, makes it a little bit awkward and easy to miss one.\n\n☺️","createDate":"1737156360","updateDate":"1737192288","approveDate":"1737156361","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139080211,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jay","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139083789","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-17","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6554722785949707}
