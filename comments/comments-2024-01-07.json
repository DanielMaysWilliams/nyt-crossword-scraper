I had no idea what was for me \"random East Asian surname\" and could neither see what kind of STRAIN nor what emotion --ST could be, even though both should have come easily (especially the STRAIN, because I did notice \"viral\" in the clue, but I kept thinking of Covid).\n\nI didn't know what went before SAVED either, and tried some weird stuff--CITY while BCC was still in there, LIFE once I was sure of SET, etc.  \n\nThe bottom line is that when you get into an area like this, you have to realize that the instincts that got you through 95% of the puzzle have failed you here, and you have to rip it all out.\n\nLuckily, FLU finally came to me.  (Who thought I'd ever write that sentence.)  I realized that BCC had to be FWD, and COST was actually DENT.  With those in place, WE'RE became clear, and at that point, Bob was my uncle.

I was hooked on the quite interesting double clues.

I don't know from \"Aladdin\" and in New York, we don't have a MUD SEASON.  Not even those of us, like me, who spend a lot of time in Central Park have a MUD SEASON.

It was named by two Australian researchers, who discovered that the smell is an oily essence emitted from rocks or soils. The oil is a complicated mixture of at least fifty different compounds, rather like a perfume.\nThe diverse nature of the host materials has led us to propose the name “petrichor” for this apparently unique odour which can be regarded as an “ichor” or “tenuous essence” derived from rock or stone. This name, unlike the general term “argillaceous odour”, avoids the unwarranted implication that the phenomenon is restricted to clays or argillaceous materials; it does not imply that petrichor is necessarily a fixed chemical entity but rather it denotes an integral odour.\n\n=== I find the aroma pleasant and refreshing in the moments before, during, and after a passing rainstorm. ===","createDate":"1704599684","updateDate":"1704663298","approveDate":"1704599685","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130288146,"parentUserDisplayName":"Keith","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130288516","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7946044206619263}
