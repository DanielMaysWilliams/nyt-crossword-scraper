Just a good and clever puzzle. I adore the comedic element throughout this debut - stringing two letter words to make a coherent phrase or sentence isn't easy, and I spent the last half hour scrunching my eyebrows trying to respond to this puzzle in kind. No go! \n\nIt jogged up an old memory, I must have been six and some older person, an aunt or one of my parents' friends, gave me a book called \"Robinson Crusoe in Words of One Syllable.\" I'm ashamed to say that even at that age I was a bit of a purist, a grammar-prig, and I was outraged by this gift. \"Will they abridge his name to Rob Cru for the duration of this book?\" I exclaimed hot, hot, hotly. Actually, while the authors did endeavor to keep the words to one syllable, if forced to employ a polysyllabic word they'd hyphenate between each syllable. I considered that cheating. Luckily, my inner Jonathan Edwards has now entered his dotage and is much more relaxed about things, ever since he started listening to Jimmy Buffet. You should try his  \"hell & brimstone\" ribs.\n\nBack to the puzzle.

I started by finding a list of legal two-letter words in Scrabble — there are 107 of them — and then throwing out the abbreviations and obscurities. This left me with a set of 35-40 words to work with. After some brainstorming with my husband/mentor, Larry Lichens, I came up with a set of theme answers to use in my initial submission. Tracy Bennett, who was my editor, helped me to arrive at a final set of answers and to polish-up the grid and fill, to get the puzzle to what you see in print.

It's the same thing as a tidal current, which is a better name for it. \n\nWhat most people erroneously call a RIP tide is really a current that forms when the water that rushes up a beach from the waves has to return, and for reasons of local topography and/or the directions from which the waves are coming, get channeled into a distinct current at one spot along the shore. They are not associated with an inlet and are not caused by the tides. Although tidal currents can be stronger, their location and timing are known and are probably not a danger to most people aware of them. But people \"from away\" might get caught in them and they could, therefore be categorized as \"dangerous.\" \n\nRip current, on the other hand, can form unexpectedly and without warning, where people are swimming, so they present a danger to the people there.","createDate":"1713907262","updateDate":"1714103569","approveDate":"1713907264","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132743795,"parentUserDisplayName":"CaptainQuahog","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132745982","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8978386521339417}
