So, in her mind, she was a true Hollander.\n\nYou see, if you forget the actual Dutch word, just say it in English, but with a Dutch accent. It's not rocket science. So, that version of the language became her vernacular.\n\nSo, we’re in a nice park in Zaanse Schans, viewing the windmills, when she spots a Hollander about her age sitting by himself on a bench. She decides to go converse with the ol’ boy in her best Dutch. I warned her several times, “Mom, these people are native Hollanders and they speak fluently. You may wish to reconsider.” “Ach, ver sonder” (or thereabouts) was her reply. “Fine, I warned you,” says I.\n\nShe sits by him and starts rattling off her absolute best Dutch ever.
