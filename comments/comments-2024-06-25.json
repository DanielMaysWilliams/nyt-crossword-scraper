Mexican-Spanish pins a \"le\" on the end of a number of verbs and words derrived from verbs to express emphasis, surprise, agreement, disapproval, etc.\n\nCluing \"√°ndale\" with a reference to a Spanish painter is like cluing \"flat,\" as in \"apartment,\" with a reference to Whitman, or \"lassie\" with a reference to Rothko.\n\nFurther, as used most often by most Mexicans, \"√°ndale\" expresses agreement. \"Vale\" would be how Goya might have said the same thing, assuming colloquial use was the same back then as it is now.

I'm ancient enough that I learned programming on a mainframe with punch cards. It was a great innovation when remote terminals came about and you could just type your programs directly into the Televideo 925.  No more handing over your punch cards to the ladies at the computer center! Yay! \n\nHowever, this did require having a logon ID and a password. In order to make my passwords memorable, I had a habit of making them rather... spicy, shall we say? The F word was a favorite ingredient. \n\nFor some reason, I had not used the mainframe in a while and when I tried to log on, I could not remember my most recent password. This meant one thing: I had to go to the window in the computer center and ask the white-haired ladies at the window to retrieve my password for me. (Password security was rather lax back in those days...) I provided my ID and answered some questions and she ran off to look up my password. I did mention to her that my passwords were sometimes a bit on the salty side. When she returned, she looked at the slip of paper on which the password was written, and said, with great disgust \" You aren't kidding about having an offensive password\" and clucked at me once or twice. Another white-haired old lady asked \"What was it?\" Not wanting to say it out loud, lady 1 showed lady 2 the slip. \n\nSUCKFACE\n\nLady 2: Oh, that's not bad at all!
