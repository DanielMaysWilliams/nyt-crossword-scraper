Only about a hundred words are understood with reasonable certainty. It doesn't help that most of the texts are funerary inscriptions, so we know the words for \"died,\" \"son of,\" but not much more.\n\nNumber words present a particular problem:  a die was found which had words, not pips, on the faces: so scholars knew the words for \"one\" through \"six,\" but not which was which. It didn't help that not all ancient Italian dice (the ones with pips) had the format 1-6/2-5/3-4 we use today. \n\nI think most of this has been sorted out, sort of, but it's still unclear if the two words \"huŒ∏\" and \"≈õa\" are \"four\" and \"six,\" or \"six\" and \"four.\" @Sam l. probably knows, but she's abandonded us, gone, gone, gone:-(","createDate":"1755689549","updateDate":"1755719028","approveDate":"1755689550","recommendations":8,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144399959","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6927382946014404}

So, whenever a Brit might talk about using \"*Satellite* Navigation for directions to the *arena*,\" they're speaking Etruscan.\n\nAlso, the Roman format for personal names-- a first name, drawn from a finite and quite limited set, followed by a familial name, passed down from generation to generation (Gaius Julius [Caesar], e.g.) --which is the format most Europeans use today--was most likely adopted from Etruscan. In Rome, the number of first names (prraenomen) was so limited, that most were just abbreviated in writing: C. Julius Caesar (\"C.\" standing for \"Gaius,\" because, well, reasons.)\n\nThis is in contrast to the original Indo-European system, in which most personal names consisted of two stems: Al-fred, Sieg-fried, Vladi-mir.
