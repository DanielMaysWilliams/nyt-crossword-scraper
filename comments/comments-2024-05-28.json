All of the spanners were NYT answer debuts as well, which brought spark to the answer set.\n\nMy brain loves trying to crack riddles, and that’s what I turned this theme into.  The graphics let me know where the revealer was, so I filled in everything except that.  I even figured the second word of the revealer was SIGNS.  So, all I had to do was unravel the first.\n\nBut my brain was stuck in the wrong direction, convinced that the signs had to do with avoiding things.  I was so stuck on that, so convinced I was right, that I never saw the water connection.  ACH!  Well, it was a good workout  -- the grind was grand! -- and a good lesson about hubris.  \n\nNext time, crosswords!  Wait and see!\n\nSmall steps.\n\nOh, I loved the cleverness of the theme.  I loved the three-vowel-in-a-row answers (VIEIRA, NAIAD), the abutting anagrams ACH and CHA, and the abutting palindromes ASA and TNT.\n\nChris, even though you waited eight years to turn this theme into a puzzle, the fact that you dreamed it up at age 14 shows great potential, whets my appetite for more from you.

I didn't even find it Tuesdane. It was enjoyable, clever, & with a fun theme.\n\nFor 7D I first thought mOthra, which was too big to fit (well duh… Mothra's pretty DAM* big), then got RODAN. I mean, I watch Svengoolie. However I started spelling it like the sculptor at 1st… I don't think that flying monster is French…\n\n* Kaiju movie \"Destroy All Monsters\" was on Svengoolie Sat night, caught a bit of it. Destroy All Monsters— often shortened in press as DAM— were a local-ish punk-/art-/noise-rock band in Ann Arbor when I lived there, Ron Ashton & the Miller twins & singer Niagara & lots of good hard music.\n\nI got WADI from crosses. ☡StarTrekNerdZone☡ A ridiculously obscure clue that woulda rightly aroused a chorus of \"OBSCURE!\" would be: 26D: Alien race in reviled ep of otherwise excellent series StarTrek:DS9, \"Move Along Home\". (Probly only 2nd in unpopularity to \"Quark Dresses in Drag\" ep, def NO Tootsie/ Some Like It Hot).\n\nI didn't know how to spell Meredith's surname but not too hard w/crosses. With NENA/WADI, it did help that I recalled NENA's name & spelling.\n\nAnd Chris, as for what you called a \"lack of flashy feel\", I dunno that that's the case, but even if it were so (& I think it ain't, what w/the cool, refreshing theme, smattering of puns & some dark snark [6D], tasty latkes & even a monster!), how could you expect any fire & flash amidst all that water?\n\nAnyway, good job, and yes we want more.","createDate":"1716925771","updateDate":"1716956821","approveDate":"1716925774","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133505994","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6102228164672852}

The three water signs represent a \"trigon,\" a trinity of signs; there are four such trigons in the zodiac -- earth, air, fire and water. Water consists of Cancer (or crab), Pisces, and Scorpio. Everdeen mentions that those born under the water signs tend to be emotional (us Scorpios, for example, tend to be intuitive and instinctive,  and act from an emotional base rather than through logic; we tend to lose control occasionally). Although I don't really believe in astrology as a predictive practice or providing guidance in life issues, personal experience has uncannily demonstrated some merit in thinking that the sign one is born under affects one's personality type. But that's because I'm a Scorpio and that's the way we think. \n\nI do like the H20-adjacent presence of WADI, SEWER, EGGNOG, NAIAD, CAPE, OTTER and especially Red Adair, who used a lot of water indeed in putting out all those fires. I suppose, though, if you looked carefully enough, you'd find words in the grid for the other trigons (air, for example, is represented by SOARS, ORATE -- a lot of hot air! -- NENA with her luftballoons full of air -- and maybe one or two others...).\n\nFun puzzle, a little hiccupy, especially the evil Natick of EVIE and VIEIRA, but that should quiet the anti-Fagliano crowd. Maybe it's a sign that we're in for a tougher week. That's how a Scorpio would reason, anyway.","createDate":"1716865919","updateDate":"1729198731","approveDate":"1716865922","recommendations":27,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133490367","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8538506031036377}
