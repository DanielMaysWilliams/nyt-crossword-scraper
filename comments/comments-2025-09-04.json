Then I thought maybe it’s the profession that scales, punnily, but Spider-Man isn’t a profession and a grapevine certainly isn’t. I’ll grant a certain leeway to a tentative revealer if the theme is really imaginative or creative, but an obviously backwards theme doesn’t fit that bill.\nSecond, the fill—about average difficulty for me—was only meh. An awful lot of glue I think and nothing really very interesting on accessory entries. Babe Ruth? Noah’s Ark clued in a cute but trite way? Yawn.
