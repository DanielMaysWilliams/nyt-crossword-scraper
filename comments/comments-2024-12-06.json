In the early days of word processing film scripts, the repetitive task of typing out line attributions (the character's name before the line of dialogue), especially in dialogue heavy scenes where you might be called upon to type the character's name scores of times, was onerous. So, many writers used the Copy and Paste functions to enter the line attributions. When screenwriting software was introduced, the writer would set up macros with the characters names and save themselves the repetitive task and the slightly clunky Copy and Paste process.","createDate":"1733495323","updateDate":"1733514588","approveDate":"1733495325","recommendations":8,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138091835","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7479735016822815}

There’s usually very little I know off the bat, yet I proceed in the confidence that once I tumble to the (always clever) misdirections, I’ll find enough in my wheelhouse to finish successfully That was my experience today, and it felt especially good coming off of Connections, where I was tripped up by my ignorance of 1980s toon characters. (My solve rate these days is about 74%.) I don’t remember ever TWISTing to Chubby Checker, but he was a rock icon in my adolescence, his rhythms pulsing from every juke box. It was nice to see him at the center of today’s grid, and finally catching the relevance of the clue gave me added pleasure. \n\nOffhand, I don’t think 37A would qualify as SPIRITANIMALS, yet I can imagine MEER KATS as C.S. Lewis’s humble sequel to his tales of Aslan the Lion (Afrikaans version). Alternative title: “MERE Felinicity.”\n\nWe find SPIRITs of a different kind in 31A and 40D.
