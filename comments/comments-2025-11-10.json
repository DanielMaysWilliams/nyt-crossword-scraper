SUPE and STOLI were gimmes. Still, especially STOLI looks so wrong! When Americans shorten English words, there is a certain logic to it, and often a perver5e sort of respect for the language. With foreign words though... Eek! Stolichnaya means \"of the capital\". Polish has a very similar word - \"stołeczna\". There is no way to abbreviate either of these words in their native tongues. It just can't be done, period. I understand that no longer applies when you subject the word to the rules (or, in a way, the lack thereof) of another language, but gurrrrl, does it look *wrooong*!\n\n[Ιάσων mode] Thanks to the editors and constructor [/Ιάσων mode]","createDate":"1762754895","updateDate":"1762833275","approveDate":"1762754897","recommendations":28,"replyCount":18,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146534590","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-10","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.643143355846405}

It could say, “Rebus Ahead!” or “No Rebus Today” or “No Rebus Requiring Multiple Letters in One Box But Look Out for a Trick”.\n\nI think this would accomplish three things:\n-People who don’t want to know ahead of time could easily avoid the warning, but folks that do want to know could easily find it.\n-Instructions and/or a link to the Wordplay column on how to put more than one letter in a box could be included for those new to the rebus.\n-Finally when there is a rebus, there should be a clear explanation of which configurations are acceptable for that particular rebus (slash or no slash, etc.).  I’ve been solving for a while, but when I don’t get the happy music at the end of a puzzle like yesterday’s, my first thought is did I enter the rebus blocks correctly.  I usually skim through the Wordplay column since it is sometimes, but not always indicated there.

At the behest of Puzzlemucker, I went back to solve a Sunday puzzle from October 31, 1999 with a not dissimilar theme. While the \"trick\" was equally hard to deduce, the clueing of the rest of the puzzle was infinitely trickier than what we were given yesterday. My feeling yesterday was that a lot of the non-theme clues were very easy in order to give solvers enough letters to the themed entries that we might deduce the theme through realizing the missing letters. Not so in 1999. If I hadn't had the heads up on the theme, I don't think I would have been able to complete it, which leads me to believe that the puzzles have become intentionally less difficult in recent years.","createDate":"1762802950","updateDate":"1762841418","approveDate":"1762802950","recommendations":17,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146556686","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5200808644294739}

This was my first exposure to one and it seems to me to negate the point/concept of the crossword puzzle entirely—that being that the two words cross each other with common letters.  The point of this of course is that in addition to simply answering a trivia question, or solving a cryptic clue, you’re expected to utilize this intersection of commonality as PART of the solving process.  In the case of the double rebus however, or at least Amie Walker’s double rebus, the two words do not contain common letters, so at that point you might as well just have two random questions on separate lines, or separate pieces of paper for that matter, as they share no crossing connection and therefore fail to meet the basic requirement of the crossword puzzle format.","createDate":"1762822087","updateDate":"1762834068","approveDate":"1762822087","recommendations":4,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146563814","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-10","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6595379710197449}

We abbreviate names all the time. For example, Agnieszka (Agnes) becomes Aga, and Aleksandra will be know to friends and family as Ala or Ola. (Interestingly, Andrzej has no abbreviation in Polish; nicknames for an Andrzej include Jędrek and Andrzejek).\n\nWhat us Slavs generally do *not* do is abbreviate non-proper nouns. We have no words like your sarge, ad, bro, etc. We literally never abbreviate adjectives.\n\nStolichnaya, or the Polish stołeczna, even though it's being used as a brand name here, ultimately is just a regular adjective.

It always revolves around a conflict between two people. They each get a chance to tell readers their side of the story, and over the following week readers vote who they think is in the right.\n\nSeveral years ago the column was about a man and a woman who had a child together. The guy refused to take care of the baby. He claimed he would not feel manly enough if he didn't do whatever it was he liked to. I can't remember what it was now, but hunting, maybe? Or sports? Anyway, he would leave the mother of his child alone for days with the baby, time after time, while he had his manly fun. And he actually thought he wasn't wrong to do so! What an @ $$wipe.\n\nIn Polish many names have a male and female version. Interestingly though, Andrzej does not - Polish does not recognize Andrea as a name.

It could work I suppose; but I think it goes against the spirit of a puzzle. Part of a puzzle is you don’t always know what you are getting. Do we have black box warnings: brand names and proper nouns ahead? Furthermore—and maybe this is patronizing, but so be it—I’d like people to get out of their comfort zone. There are lots of people who didn’t like rebuses initially, and came to appreciate them. If they were never forced to confront them, maybe they would never have come to that realization. You start a puzzle and find out it’s a rebus and want to give up, fine, I can’t stop you.

My issue and maybe same for others was that I had never heard of a double rebus before and didn’t know those new rules existed, or could ever be allowable in a crossword.  Now that I know such a thing exists I’ll be able to consider it in future when something g doesn’t seem to be adding up even with a traditional rebus entry. That’s where I got stuck. I knew it was a rebus, but never considered a double rebus where all the letters don’t work both ways.  And I have to say, I think when the letters don’t work both ways, I still think it’s kind of a cop out, but maybe I’ll come around in time ;)","createDate":"1762828280","updateDate":"1762862677","approveDate":"1762828280","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146564170,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ace","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146565103","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-10","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5558382272720337}

I was working as a stand in for Betty Grable on a small French picture called “L’anus Gras” at the time, and Rogers had a lengthy scene with Grable towards the beginning of the film where he waxed philosophical about the meaning of life, death, love and loss, all while riding naked on a seatless unicycle and juggling a trio of persimmons.  At one point he asks, “À quoi bon se raser le scrotum si les poils repoussent?” To which Grable was supposed to respond, “I’m sorry, but I don’t speak Portuguese.”  The only problem was Betty had been taken ill earlier that afternoon after a lunch of bad shellfish, and instead of speaking the line as written, she instead proceeded to spew a technicolor stream of disgorgement directly onto Mr, Rogers, who, atop his one-wheeled steed, began rocking and wobbling until he rolled straight down a hill and flew awkwardly into the Gulf of Lion, never to be seen again. His last words as he soared clumsily toward the sea were, “tell Mickey Rooney he still owes me twenty bucks!”","createDate":"1762829449","updateDate":"1762858165","approveDate":"1762829450","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146565029,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ace","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146565406","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8481829166412354}
