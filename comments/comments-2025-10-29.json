We always say that it's not necessarily the most common example that is used in a clue, as long as the answer is a lesser-used but accepted example of the clue.  We had that the other day with adaptor/adapter, and there's at least one every day.  \n\nBut what if only one supporting example can be found, and it's quite rare?  Like the specific guitar Jim mentioned.  Particularly because that Gibson is an acoustic/electric guitar (something I didn't even know existed) and not a pure electric.\n\nMaybe the rule should be that such \"misdirection\" should be avoided if there's no wordplay, and if the level of difficulty is made greater because people with greater familiarity to the subject consider the clue wrong because it's suggesting that something that's far outside the norm is a regular characteristic of the item involved.  Certainly, [Stereo knob] would have worked just as well, without giving anything away.\n\nSo [Mythical luster] is fine because it plays on \"luster\" being one who lusts (a new one to go with shower, flower, etc.) instead of being a sheen.

(Or worse, HAIL.) I love a Wednesday that doesn't think it's Thursday. This was almost Tuesday-and-a-half, but that's, of course, my own experience. Your mileage may vary. \n\nWas thrilled to learn that our trick-or-treating will actually be on Oct. 31 this year, and last a whole 2 hours. When I was a kid, it started as soon as we got home from school. For my kidlets, it was as soon as they scarfed down the pizza for dinner (I had all their friends start at my house because most of their moms had jobs that were not as flexible as mine). I got them painted and costumed, and out we went. My son was done after one block. \"That's enough,\" he would say. My daughter and her friends would be out for a good two to three hours, in our heavily populated suburb. \n\nNow I live in an area where, if we get 20 kids, it's a lot, and they came together in vans from who knows where. I don't care, we're prepared. \n\nGeorge, our household ghost, loves Halloween, and is already preparing. Yesterday he messed with my Keurig machine, turning it off mid-pour. He also turns water spigots on and off, and plays with our stereo system.

Good, silly fun is one of my favorite of many kind of good fun!\n\nI have to admit, I didn't even make the connection to Halloween until the comments. It's never been a big part of my life, I suppose because growing up, we were not allowed to partake for religious reasons. The thought of it being evil never actually took with me but I also just don't care about it either....  We don't get trick-or-treaters where we live, so I often forget about it. Other than to buy cheap candy for the office afterwards. 😏 \n\nHard to pick a favorite of the themers but of the non-themers, FEDORA for 32A Felt something on your head was great! Also really liked ODD for Some jobs and SATYR for Mythical luster\n\nAnd I liked including both ABASE and EDIFY.  If only they'd crossed. \n\nRAPID took me quite a bit b/c I could only think of the band, and I didn't know the origins of the band's name, so until it dawned on me that it meant the sleep stage I didn't get it. Good crosses showed me the way...   And then, I also learned that apparently, the band picked REM out of the dictionary and went with it as a name. Ha! Ah, the 80s!!

For whatever reason, I've been thinking about Dracula a lot lately, for reasons unrelated to Halloween. (Also, that bizarre portrait of Vlad the Impaler where his mustache gives the impression that he's balancing a large cigar on his upper lip) \n\n\nSomething I learned today is that when Albin Grau wanted to make a film based on Bram Stoker's 'Dracula,' he was forced by copyright restrictions to make various changes to the narrative. This introduced certain vampiric tropes that now seem ubiquitous, but weren't present in the original text. For instance, in Stoker's novel, vampires were only slightly harmed by sunlight, whereas in Grau's 'Nosferatu', they get burned to a crisp. In the end however, Grau still wasn't able to evade a lawsuit!

On the other hand, the opposition to Halloween in Poland reeks of medieval religiosity - some Catholics decry Halloween as \"promoting occultism\". As a kneee jerk reaction, that almost makes me want to celebrate it. Those Catholics offer an alternative - All Saints Parades, where children dress up as Catholic saints. They are one of the few reasons I regret not having kids. I bet the organisers would love it if I sent my son to the parade as St Barthlomew, flayed and carrying his own skin in his hands.

I can imagine the horror of the ecclesiastics!\nNot being a Catholic country, Halloween doesn’t cause such an uproar, it’s more an ‘eye roll yet another imported  American custom’ (with apologies to our NYT friends).\n  Like you, it just wasn’t a thing when I was a kid. I did take my own trick or treating, but only to friends houses and definitely no tricking allowed. I think it’s the ‘trick’ part that doesn’t go down well here. It’s seen as a complete lack of courtesy, plus knocking on doors for sweets is only a step up from begging, particularly for the older generation.

Also, there are specific hours designated within many areas (18:00-20:00, e.g.) which limits the disruption. \n\nThere is very little “tricking”, except perhaps the candy companies fooling us all into buying irrational amounts of sweet treats. 😅 Certainly some unruly teens smash a few pumpkins, or perhaps TP a frenemy’s house, which most would say is bad form. Any of that is mischief carried out well after dark and quite dissociated  from the trick-or-treating activity. \n\nI think that, in many neighborhoods, it’s really a pleasant time to walk (weather depending) around with your children, greeting your friends and neighbors with a wave from the street as they hand out treats to the kids at the door.

I have no expertise with electric guitars, so had no idea whether none, some, or all have TREBLE knobs; it seems to make sense that they might so I had no trouble with that. But the other day when ECZEMA was equated with ATOPIC DERMATITIS, that was obviously wrong to me because I have a medical background. They are both “wrong” but probably OK for most people; mistakes happen; and I would argue that a clue should actually be derided when it is so misleading that people actually can’t solve it as a result of it. (For example I was very persistent about the NOTI vs NORI controversy earlier because it prevented people from solving the puzzle). I don’t think most doctors were unable to solve the ECZEMA clue, nor musicians the TREBLE clue; so in that case I think it’s appropriate to comment on it for everyone’s education (I certainly appreciate that), confirm it’s a nit, and then move on. There are over 600 clues a week, and I think the editors do a great job for the most part with accuracy and fairness, and even when they slip up it rarely affects the solve.","createDate":"1761757160","updateDate":"1761788241","approveDate":"1761757160","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146274032,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146280064","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5937985777854919}

My point is when clues aren’t necessarily 100 percent accurate for the pedants, it’s fine to point it out for learning purposes, but that doesn’t mean you have to say the clue is “wrong” per se. I’m happy to learn that most guitars don’t have TREBLE knobs, and if even just a few do (and it’s not confusing) I’m happy to say it’s good enough for crossword purposes, just as I’m willing to say the ECZEMA clue is ok. But that doesn’t mean I might not want to point it out anyway, just for teaching. And just because a medical site lists it doesn’t make it correct. The site you listed was written for patients, who might hear them used interchangeably, and that’s fine (and also ok for crossword purposes); but nothing wrong to point out the inaccuracy just to educate people.

We didn't say 'trick or treat' but children were expected to perform - sing a song, say poem or do a dance in order to get a treat, usually one sweet or a biscuit.\n\nWe would carve out turnip/swede lanterns, very hard work. \n\nThere were Halloween parties when you 'dooked' for apples (others call it apple bobbing) when you tried to grab an apple with your teeth from a tub of water, hands behind your back. Another version was to drop a fork from your mouth into the water to try and spear an apple. Cub Scouts and Brownies always had these parties.\n\nThere were also treacle scones - scones or slices of bread (pieces) were smeared with black treacle (molasses?) and threaded though a string and hung up.

So it wasn’t hard for that to develop into the equivalent of Halloween, where kids would dress up in any costume. I don’t think they really “trick or treat” and go door to door but there is generally a lot of parties and treats to be had.

My mother was an atheist, and my father an agnostic (he has since progressed to atheism, too). My best friend Łukasz came from a religious, Calvinist family though, and the way he and his parents talked about god and what he meant in their lives sounded quite nice. I was fascinated, and very close to becoming a believer myself. My parents were ok with it.\n\nEverything changed in 1989, when the old regime fell, and the new one introduced religion as an (optional) subject at school beginning in 1990, when I started 4th grade. Given my beliefs at the time I went to those classes enthusiastically and with an open mind. Quickly I became disenchanted. It was Catholic indoctrination, effectively. Nothing the teacher - a nun - said was even remotely close to the joyous image of faith I had been learning from Łukasz. In 5th grade we got a new religion teacher - a middle aged priest. He was a bully who had no idea how to deal with preteens. He showed me the worst facets of Polish Catholicism, conservative, intolerant, allergic to joy, detached from rationality, and hypocritical. Within a year I was an atheist. Isn't it funny how religion classes, of all things, extinguished the religious spark in me?\n\nAt no time in this religious evolution of mine was I pressured by my parents.","createDate":"1761770401","updateDate":"1761803775","approveDate":"1761770401","recommendations":15,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146283655,"parentUserDisplayName":"HeathieJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146285675","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7249359488487244}

You've written of you and your mom being atheists but that's a very interesting addition to your story. I'm sad to hear, but not that surprised, that the teachers extinguished the spark.

I don't think it'll get past the filters or I'd paste it. \n\nAs for me, I continue to be a Christian - a believer - but not in the same way I was trained. That difference is felt mightily in these days of increasingly mixed politics and Christianity here in the U.S. My own mom tells me that no Christian could vote for the dem side...  and that I've become a Godless liberal, and shunned everything I was taught. Um, but that she still loves me. 😒 While some would rejoice in being called a Godless liberal, I don't.
