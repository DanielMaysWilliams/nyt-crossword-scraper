Here we all are, sharing our experience, and a lively discussion ensues.  Since my spouse & I are retired, we don't get much of that anymore.  \nFor my own part, I have decided that I am not much of a theme person.  The Sunday themes are fun, but most of the time in weekday puzzles the theme is lost on me even once it's been explained.  Themes are not why I come to a crossword. But most of the time they don't detract from the solving fun, as in today's puzzle.\nI played Clue a lot as a kid, as a solitaire game. All my siblings were 10 or more years older than I, so I surrounded with toys and activities that were for much older kids & folks.  I spent hours in those rooms with the lead pipe & candlestick, and my set had a real rope, not the plastic lump that's in there these days, and I'd make up stories and scenes and situations. \nHowever, I didn't get any vibe of Clue while I solved the puzzle, and once I looked at 62A's clue and squinted at the circled letters, I couldn't make anything out of them, so I just carried on solving.  After reading Sam's explanation, I see the room names, but it's not clicking in my brain.\nNo matter!

However, one of the main reasons for most students to take these in the Junior year is that is the requirement to use only those scores to apply for the National Merit Scholarship Program. From the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC):\n“Can sophomores qualify for National Merit recognition?\nNo. Even if your scores are high enough, you will not be eligible for National Merit as a sophomore unless you will be graduating a year early.

This clue is just plain _wrong_.\n\nIf we define \"ingredient\" as \"one of a list of items required to correctly make the recipe,\" then yeast is the one thing that is NOT an ingredient in sourdough, because it is understood as \"commercially cultivated yeast\" (aka instant yeast) in baking recipes, not the wild yeast that is present in everything, which inadvertently becomes the raising agent for traditional sourdough. I'm sure one of you \"defenders\" can pull up some more complex (usually pro bakery, volume-oriented) recipe that includes instant yeast AND starter made with wild yeast - I've seen and used a couple myself - but the very distinction of sourdough is that the dough ferments (for a much longer time, because it is necessary) using wild yeast, NOT instant yeast that can develop in an hour. \n\nTo summarize: if you want sourdough in a home setting, yeast is the one thing you are _specifically_ not adding separately, because it would make the \"sour\" part of \"sourdough\" harder to achieve, therefore it would be _purposefully_ absent from an ingredient list. \n\nWhy not just \"frequently used dough ingredient\"?
