Smooth solve, decent for a Wednesday, and a pretty grid. Peter Pan went completely over my head (pun intended). Had aortae before aortas so confidently entered VEEP since VPS was the last answer when  “number 2” was in the puzzle (I remember because I fleetingly thought it was something more scatological).

Most of us live in apartments, and not very big ones, either - a typical Polish flat is some 60 sq.m, with a living room, kitchen, bathroom, toilet, hall, and two bedrooms. For decades flat size was limited by design (the state built and gave them away before 1989, but without any luxury), and now by prohibitive prices (one sq.m. in Warsaw costs 2-3 monthly salaries). For families with children it's not uncommon for the parents to sleep on a sofa bed in the living room, with the bedrooms given over to kids. \n\nEven if that is not the case, almost nobody has a guest bedroom, so a sofa bed still makes sense for when you get overnight visitors.\n\nI remember how surprised my mother and mother-in-law were when my wife and I got a non-bed sofa for our apartment - we went for form over function (but we have a large place, no kids, and a spare bedroom).","createDate":"1754454719","updateDate":"1754545601","approveDate":"1754454721","recommendations":34,"replyCount":17,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144068439","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5636729001998901}

Greyhound is so much better, isn't it? Sleek, fast, elegant. It may have very little to do with the actual service offered (I mean, I know Greyhound from tv and films only, and there it's not great, to put it mildly :D), but the image projected by the brand name is great.\n\n@mbm\n\nThanks!

The pledge of allegience at school... It seems so weird to me! We never had such a thing even before 1989, and at present it would be unthinkable. The closest we ever get is singing the national anthem during school assemblies. Maybe it's because it reminds us too much of totalitarian practices of the USSR and 1933-1945 Germany, which required people unquestioningly submit to the state?","createDate":"1754488356","updateDate":"1754498976","approveDate":"1754488357","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144074482,"parentUserDisplayName":"sotto voce","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144075067","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7849438190460205}

A typical term for such a loan is 30 years, and the monthly repayments are a heavy burden on the household's budget for all that time (AFAIK a typical repayment for a typical Warsaw mieszkanie is about the same as a minimum monthly salary, which in turn is about half of a typical Warsaw salary).\n\nRenting is only ever considered temporary, tbh.\n\n\"Dom\" also means \"home,\" as in the place you live, be it a mieszkanie, dom (in the narrow sense), an extended residency hotel, etc.","createDate":"1754486370","updateDate":"1754535930","approveDate":"1754486372","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144068439,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144073895","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8862303495407104}

They can sometimes be two storeys, but will never be from the ground to the top of the building, and will generally share utility infrastructure. \n\nWe do also have the concept of a townhouse, but that's usually just a house (most likely terraced) in a dense urban area, where you'd be more likely to find flats. And they're most likely to be old buildings (georgian/victorian probably) So, for example, if you owned a house in Soho in London, you might say you have a townhouse, as most houses there have been converted to flats. But there's no actual definition difference between a townhouse and a normal house, and it's usually just very fancy houses in London that get called townhouses.","createDate":"1754563484","updateDate":"1754563485","approveDate":"1754563485","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144094513,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144097358","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8617536425590515}
