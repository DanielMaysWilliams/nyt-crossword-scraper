Doctorow, weaving the lives of a rich suburban WASP family, a poor Harlem musician and his family, and an immigrant Jewish father and daughter together in the early 20th century.  It addressed the racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and classism of 100 years ago, and is still applicable today.  It was a nearly three-hour show, and worth every minute.  Some of the music bordered on operatic, but most of it, not so much.  And being a Broadway production, the performance was top notch. It was a very moving experience.\n\nMy earliest introduction to musical theater was in high school, when I participated in one (\"The King and I\"). (Minor non-singing role, of course!)\n\nBut the buzz that year among all the theater kids was the new \"rock opera,\" \"Jesus Christ Superstar.\"  Most of us got our first exposure to it from the cast album, available before the show was on Broadway.  We knew the entire show by heart (all singing, no spoken words).  And I think I can still sing practically any number from it even today.\n\nPretty odd for a kid just a few years removed from his bar mitzvah!\n\n(Everything I know about the New Testament comes from that show.)","createDate":"1761832264","updateDate":"1761880623","approveDate":"1761832265","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146297822,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146298533","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5336433053016663}
