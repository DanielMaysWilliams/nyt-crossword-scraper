Nice debut. But the theme just did not work for me at all. It initially appears that the \"lies\" are hidden in various black boxes, perhaps evoking the idea that you want to conceal any untruths from the polygraph. This idea works cleanly for the three across answers that are split by the putative black boxes of deception. But then other answers both across and down fall a bit short of concealing the whole lie in the box, like STEEL[IE] and BEL[IE].  If that were the theme, it would be an obscure and weak one, but at least consistent. Instead, the theme is that \"lies\" are rebus \"spikes\" sitting in the middle of just two three-box spike sequences, but not the center one, and one atop a lone random square in the puzzle? Nope. Doesn't work. It's not supposed to be easy, but this one and the one two Thursdays ago appear as though the original theme became too difficult, so they smushed it around to complete the puzzle.

I am simply not on the constructor's wavelength, I don't know most of the trivia, and my method of dealing with such cases has proved to be my undoing today.\n\nI had very little on my first pass. I did a slower second one, sadly without much success. So I proceeded as I always do in such hopeless cases: I started looking up the trivia. I saw no other way out, but I don't really like doing that, especially on Thursdays, when there is the risk of looking up an entry that is actually themed/part of the trick, without there being any indication thereof. And that's exactly what happened: one of the bloody Kardashians, of all people, crossing natickly with some sinister American company with a perversely cutesy name, spoiled the rebus for me 😢\n\nEven after lookups the grid was still largely empty. I shrugged and turned on autocheck. I have very few ideas what letters to try where. There will be a lot of brute forcing in my further attempts to fill the grid. In fact, I feel I may break down and just reveal entries. And I still haven't grasped the other part of the trick, the one with the dashes...\n\nDon't get me wrong btw, I'm not criticizing the puzzle or the constructor.

There was no way I would ever have been able to do this on my own. So many words I did not know, further obfuscated by the theme I was not smart and observant enough to understand. I mean, I am not particularly intellectually challenged, but there *is* something simple about the way I perceive the world and the puzzles in it. I am a bit like my dog, Jorge the lab: he is the smartest dog I have ever had and he is absolutely great at stuff he has already experienced. He also learns new things quickly, when instructed - many a time he grasped in one or two tries many tricks beyond the ability of other dogs. Still... Throw something new and complex at him and leave him alone with it, and often he will just stand there, tilting his graying head, trying to compute but failing, and often resorting to barking at the novel and incomprehensible. You know how dogs and their owners are often very alike? Today I proved I am like Jorge, just much less cute (nobody smiles at *me* in the street).\n\nI know about rebuses. I know about dashes. I'm reasonably good at solving puzzles with either. However, a combination of the two was beyond me. I was so fixated on the dashes I failed to take into account a rebus might be part of the equasion, too. This led to the blunder of unwittingly looking up a themed entry. It all went downhill from there. Feeling dispirited, I let mental fog engulf me, and I was done for.\n\nAn impressively constructed puzzle, hats off to the constructor 🏅","createDate":"1727950222","updateDate":"1729349690","approveDate":"1727950225","recommendations":60,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136605855","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-03","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5576207637786865}

I mean, I am not an idiot, but there *is* something simple about the way I perceive the world and the puzzles in it. I am a bit like my dog, Jorge the brown lab: he is the smartest dog I have ever had and he is absolutely great at stuff he has already experienced. He also learns new things quickly, when instructed - he grasped in one or two tries many tricks beyond the ability of other dogs. Still... Throw something new and complex at him and leave him alone with it, and often he will just stand there, tilting his graying head, trying to compute but failing, and often resorting to barking at the novel and incomprehensible.\n\nYou know how dogs and their owners are often very alike? Today I proved I am like Jorge, just much less cute (nobody smiles at *me* in the street).\n\nI know about rebuses. I know about dashes. I'm reasonably good at solving puzzles with either. However, a combination of the two was beyond me. I was so fixated on the dashes I failed to take into account a rebus might be part of the equasion, too.

I don’t generally think of myself as old or intellectually challenged until I come up against a puzzle like Rena’s, only to discover that it was created and accepted when she was a senior in high school. (Rena, congratulations on a great debut!) This one took me a bit longer than most Thursdays, even after I figured out the theme.\n\nI can relate to you and Jorge. People are constantly telling my puppy, Oliver, how cute and smart he is. They are not wrong. As you noted, dogs and their owners are often alike but I have reluctantly accepted the fact that I will never match Oliver’s appeal to complete strangers on the street.","createDate":"1727956104","updateDate":"1728167494","approveDate":"1727956107","recommendations":17,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136605855,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136607017","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9198432564735413}

Thanks for the great commentary today. BTW, I thought more about your upcoming visit to NYC…I’ve already put my two cents in about riding a bike in the city. Some suggested Central Park as a good place to ride. Be cautious with that. They don’t allow bikes on the pedestrian paths, although they have a couple of shared paths. The various drives through the park have plenty of bikes, but there are a lot of real serious bikers on expensive bikes who ride very fast and usually have little patience for cross-walk etiquette. One famous tourist from an Irish band learned about Central Park biking the hard way (thank goodness he was eventually ok).

They expect everybody to watch out for them but never watch our for anybody themselves. Much like BMW drivers, eh? (which is funny coming from me, as a BMW is one of my main picks for my next car. I love to drive fast cars slowly - one of my many quirks). Is Central Park big enough for a bike ride? We like long routes, 30 kilometers or more, and not made up of laps around the same place. We are also avid walkers - we can walk up to 30 kilometers a day, easy. That seems like a better option for Central Park, no? I must admit I am really scared of riding a bike in the US, given how ridiculously huge and deadly dangerous all those oversize SUVs are.

I'd suggest 2-3 days of just walking before you decide if you need to bike around.  And even then the rentable Citibikes are a reasonable approach for short jaunts.

Even if you'll be spending time in Brooklyn your feet and public transit are best bets.\n\nEnjoy!  I hope the country and the city are welcoming for you.
