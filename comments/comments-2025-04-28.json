I purchased it when it was only a five-year-old in 1990 from my know-it-all mother-in-law, who wanted a newer sedan. At first, I thought, \"Awesome!\" but before I had traveled the span of one mile, I started thinking \"Does this car even have a pulse?\" And my mother-in-law had split with my money like she was on the lam: took the US Air flight direct to Honolulu, sent us a postcard of her in a tutu on the beach, her red-nosed visage very merry from all the mojitos she had consumed. \"Aloha all my Steeler fans back home!\" she had written on the back. In time the car became my hated nemesis, and I was like a walking ATM for the jack-of-all-trades who worked on it. We still occasionally get a postcard from my dear mother-in-law from the yurt she's living in, where it's never nippy, never like being in a toaster, the moon never wanes, there's no wifi, so you can't do any ego-surfing but plenty of other kinds.

Compare this to an SUV or station wagon (estate wagon), in which the passenger area and the storage area are continuous. You can seat people in the third row or put the seats down for more carrying space. \n\nA SEDAN is also characterized by three roof support columns; SUVS and wagons have four. A convertible has no fixed roof; a coupe or coupé is similar to a SEDAN, but smaller and it generally has two doors. \n\nOther body types have existed in the past, but are no longer produced. \n\nFor even more information:\n\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile</a>)","createDate":"1745842567","updateDate":"1745866798","approveDate":"1745842568","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141756248,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141758491","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9103262424468994}
