That middle five-stack, for instance?  Three debuts and two once-befores, and all beautifully crossed.  Wow!\n\nThere were, for me, only a few no-knows, yet this fought me tooth and nail.  Battling me were vague clues with many answer possibilities, making confidently putting answers down rare and wonderful.  \n\nThere’s an art to having just enough cracks in the grid to let the light in. And that art – at Saturday level – was in full display today. Bravo Samuel and editors!  \n\nI loved the debut YES CHEF, as I’m a fan of “The Bear”, in which that phrase is rife.\n\nMy brain loved having its workout ethic well satisfied, and I’m thrilled by your presence in Crosslandia, Samuel.

Hey, made sense, even if insulting (reminds me of a GREAT \"Monk\" episode)… put FLood @18A [Lights…], had image of old Cagney-etc prison films (or The Great Escape)… started 47D w/\"nil\" [Zip], w/crosses I couldn't decide btwn PEP/PoP. (NEMoA made as much sense to me as NEMEA). Thank the Deus Xwrd Machina for BWANA Don.\n\nLiked a lot of the clueing, & some unknown answers made head-nodding sense when formed, like FACETAT.\n\nI enjoyed this puzzle; even when I thot I might not get it I didn't feel the kinda \"Natick!\"y resentment I sometimes do w/actual weak puzzles… I thought, this kinda harkens back to those oldschool Sat puzzles I often couldn't finish back in the day!\n\nSolid Saturday Sojourn.\n\nAnd if Mr Smalley sees some negative comments here, which often happen w/a tough weekend puzzle, he might take a page from his cousin Stuart, look in the mirror, & remind himself he's good enuf, he's smart enuf… etc.\n\nThanks Sam!

But there’s no shame in that! To paraphrase Will Weng, “It’s your puzzle — solve it however you like.”\n\nSo I wouldn’t see this puzzle as one that “thumbs its nose at ordinary solvers” — but rather a proper Saturday aimed at more experienced ones.\n\nAlso, FWIW it wasn’t the trivia that made this one challenging, in my opinion. There actually wasn’t that much trivia, certainly not in key places in the grid. Rather, what makes classic Saturdays like this challenging is deliberately vague cluing that allows multiple answers to many of the clues — requiring you to consider multiple potential answers to mutiple clues simultaneously before finding the combinations that make sense together.","createDate":"1760790186","updateDate":"1760872883","approveDate":"1760790190","recommendations":54,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146019324,"parentUserDisplayName":"Vernon","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146019558","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5398204326629639}

My first go gave me ROMA, MARINARA and the WELL in what I thought would be WELLMAYBE. My downs were TWEAKS and BWANA.

I'm from rural NE Ireland just below the border and would use a \"pan of bread\" rather than \"pan loaf\" though (or \"loaf of bread\") when talking about regular bread (vs batch/plain loaf) at home and it's what my mam would say. Definitely hear it more in Ireland than in Scotland (and not at all in England). \n\nI do just say \"bread\" or \"thing of bread\" now tho because GF bread is just in a different part of my brain I guess which I didn't realise until now.","createDate":"1760871496","updateDate":"1760871497","approveDate":"1760871497","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146035577,"parentUserDisplayName":"snufkin","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146035929","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7628499269485474}
