And that’s also despite not knowing most of the proper nouns.\n      So what’s the problem? So many interesting entries clued in absolutely the most straightforward, uninteresting way. And I have no idea if these are the editors’  or the constructor’s clues. This is not about me being on the same wavelength as the constructor, there is no other wavelength. CAT IN THE HAT—is there anyone who has read or seen this that won’t remember Thing One and Thing Two? Was there no other interesting bit of trivia or misdirection? Results of some remarriages— BLENDED FAMILIES—a marquee entry clued in the most straightforward way possible. FREESOLOED—climbed without ropes. NEPOBABIES. DROPSDEAD. WAGEGAPS. I could go on. It spoils the few really clever clues (and there were some—BASSDRUM, OPERAGOER.)
