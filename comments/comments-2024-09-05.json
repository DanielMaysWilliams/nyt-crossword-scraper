Overall they were way too easy.   It seems more and more that since Thursday puzzles have “tricks”, the editors compensate with really straightforward cluing.   With this puzzle they went way too far.  I’m not calling for Saturday level cluing, but this level of clueing makes the puzzle not a challenge and boring to boot.","createDate":"1725508598","updateDate":"1725574813","approveDate":"1725508600","recommendations":9,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135953070","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-05","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7705454230308533}
