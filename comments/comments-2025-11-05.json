That only appeared in one other puzzle and it was one of five theme answers in a Tuesday puzzle from February 15, 2005 by Gene Newman. All of those answers had exactly the same clue: \n\n \"Ringers.\" \n\nAnd the other same theme answers were: \n\nLOOKALIKES\nIDENTICALTWINS\nSPITTINGIMAGES\nDUPLICATES \n\nHere's that link: \n\n<a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/15/2005&g=35&d=A\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/15/2005&g=35&d=A</a>\n\n...","createDate":"1762352497","updateDate":"1762387290","approveDate":"1762352497","recommendations":10,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146421938","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8302483558654785}

And some great fill: I love the way some words sound even if not said aloud, like IGNEOUS or COPSE. \n\nThe film references were all gimmes today; TRON (with the Pong clue) and Silence of the Lambs, plus 16 Candles: methinks Chad might be a fellow Gen-Xer? 😁\n\nI loved the revealer, and the twist away from the sarcasm with which I associate it. SECRET CRUSHES, what a thrill! Like others, though, I feel PAGE with BOOKMARKS is a little too stretchy. That plus the now deprecated HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) leads me to believe that area could have been reworked... Change the answer to the more acceptable SITE BOOKMARKS (and the clue from \"site\" to \"web\")...

It was during his dukedom (1448-1450), however, that England lost its possessions in northern France, and a portion of the blame was pinned on de la Pole. (So potent was the blame, in fact, that he was murdered in 1450.) The unfortunate duke lost his life and also gained a nickname: Jack Napis. The Jack part came from Jack as a term of address for one deemed socially inferior; the s on the end was a common nickname element; and the api was an allusion to something on de la Pole’s heraldic badge (a kind of personal emblem): the image of an ape’s clog—a weight that was used with a chain to restrain a monkey. Jack Napis eventually developed into jackanapes, a word that referred first to a monkey or ape less than a century after the duke had met his demise.
