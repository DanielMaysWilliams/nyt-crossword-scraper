The clue for 38A is driving me crazy. Obviously clues are not necessarily definitions (though even the abominable MW gets it right) and it is Saturday, but this one is just too far off. A subgroup is a coset (if you forget about its algebraic structure), but most of the time cosets are not subgroups. It has been clued coherently in the past: \"subdivision in group theory\" and \"algebraic grouping\" are much better.\n\nHere is a concrete example: The integers {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}=Z are a group under addition. For a fixed integer N, the  multiples of N {...,-2N,-N,0,N,2N,...}=NZ form a subgroup, since the sum of two multiples of N is a multiple of N, etc., with N cosets, NZ, NZ+1, NZ+2, ... , NZ+(N-1). When N=2 this is just evens (the subgroup) and odds (the other coset), when N=12 you get clock arithmetic. An odd plus an odd is even, so the odd numbers do not form a subgroup.\n\nHere is one way to think about it. One could sensibly (and unimaginatively) clue, say, \"insect\" with \"ladybug\", and nobody would complain since a ladybug is a sort of insect, but nobody thinks \"here is the class of cosets\" and then gives a subgroup as a typical example.","createDate":"1709983712","updateDate":"1710032624","approveDate":"1709983714","recommendations":5,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131724855","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-09","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6844292879104614}

When I woke up today, I remember feeling a little disappointed that the answer for the clue they sometimes come in shoe boxes was boots. I thought that was a real cop out! I opened the puzzle and just started laughing so hard at myself. It's been a rough several days and it was good to laugh!\n\nAside from my silliness, I did enjoy the puzzle and that's not always the case for Saturdays. I, like many, struggled with FIT and FAN. It was the last thing I got and I had to do it as a lookup cuz just nothing made sense to me. Thank you to all of you who ksometimes repeatedly) explained the meaning of those words in their clue contexts earlier in the comments section. FAN I'd have missed but I really should have figured out FIT for meet.\n\nEnjoyed MacGyvering -- and the Denis Leary and Descartes quotes a lot!
