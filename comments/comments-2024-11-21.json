To this American ear, the word connotes anything that requires agility and skill, which would basically make it a synonym for sports (which we use in the plural unless we mean one specific sport).\n\nOur youngsters take a period of physical education, which is shortened casually to Phys Ed or PE, or just called gym class.  It usually takes place in a gymnasium, but also on playing fields, if the school has them (you might say pitches).\n\nBy the way, IN OT, meaning in overtime, is the equivalent to soccer's \"in extra time\".

The first line of defense appears to be a filter that picks up curse words and short comments from frequent commenters (which is what bots sometimes do). “EMU” is a backronym for this “Electronic Moderating Unit.”\n\nMany commenters pad short comments with extra text or blank lines. Such padding often includes a reference to the emus. \n\nBecause comments sometimes go through without a problem, some people deny the existence of emus. Trust me, they’re real.
