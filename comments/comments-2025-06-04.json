When purchased collections arrived, she had skimmed off the cream and sent the rest to storage in the UT tower, many in still unopened crates. It was decided to make at least a bare bones catalog of the books so that scholars could stop borrowing them from other libraries. I handled everything from a huge collection of Edna St. Vincent Millay, to signed 1st editions of Proust, Hemingway, Nabokov, so many others I don't remember, and, of course, the Thomas Stearns Eliot books.

I was born in 1980, so Woodstock is just a historical event for me. Alice in Wonderland is not a part of Polish cultural heritage, and I've never tried any drugs, not even weed - I just let alcohol almost kill my liver. \n\n@clue by four \n\nWell, before 1989 the regime told people what to think of the Warsaw Uprising. After 1989 we needed new myths and a new version of Polish patriotism - the Uprising emerged as a huge part of what effectively became new propaganda. Most people who drive around with \"1944 pamiętamy\" bumper stickers (We remember 1944) know nothing about it beyond the heroic vision created by the  propagandist narrative.\n\nEven many of the veterans of the Uprising protest against that vision - they don't see themselves as heroes but rather as victims of history, and they tell people to learn from the mistakes of the past rather than glorify them.\n\nAlas, most people are fine with sticking to what they've been told is the only *true* version of patriotism. Critical thinking is frowned upon rather than encouraged.\n\nAs a son of some of Poland's best historians I spent almost a year studying the Uprising myself. I know too much about it to be fooled by the simplistic, heroic propaganda.","createDate":"1749026955","updateDate":"1749101057","approveDate":"1749026957","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142586542,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142588610","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-04","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6672178506851196}
