It was an easy Friday that I solved in Tuesday time but the grid, the average answer  length, the themelessness, the fresh fill are all Friday hallmarks. \n\nI like the fact that the NYT does not treat the relatively difficulty level of the days of the week as a hard and fast rule, although I notice this is a favorite topic for kvetching on here. There are only two themeless puzzles a week. It’s nice that some are easy and some are hard. Part of the fun for me is not knowing the exact difficulty level and therefore having to consider a wider range of possible answers. Tomorrow may take me 20 minutes or an hour and a half.

I think that's really sad. I learned in \"junior high school\" & I find it really useful. It was an elective. I was going to take stenography after that, but that never happened. \n\nI learned at university there are certain skills that are easier for young people to learn--& I think touch typing is one of them. Think of foreign language. The best time for children to learn a foreign language is when they're learning the first language. They don't use grammar books, verb charts, vocabulary lists, etc. They just pick it up like a sponge.\n\nWhen people reach puberty, that kind of learning dries up somewhat. Some synapses in the brain disappear! I heard an interview with a famous pianist who said that all the pieces he learned when he was young, he memorized. After puberty--not so much.\n\nMany people know an immigrant family: the kids sound like native speakers of English; the older ones will never lose some foreignisms--in pronunciation and/or syntax.\n\nI know a young woman who just finished her B.S. pre-med w/ great grades. Now she's working on preparing to take the MCATs for medical school. She told me the MCATs don't allow the use of calculators. Now she has to learn all over how to do the simplest math without her device. How much is 10% of 150? She'll practice & figure out those types of problems now. It's sad that students don't have this basic facility with math problems without \"smart\" phones.","createDate":"1763129411","updateDate":"1763181306","approveDate":"1763129412","recommendations":8,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146643304","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4965250492095947}

Reading personal insight on the music while listening was a wonderful ritual that gave engaging perspective, and often some interesting behind the scenes insider info.  For example, I never knew the piano at Abbey Road was so incurably out of tune that Lennon had to perform the vocal on “Imagine” while submerged in a tank of tomato aspic to get the pitches to match.  Or that the drum intro on “50 Ways To Leave Your Lover” was actually Richard Nixon shaking his jowls into an SM57.  Often what we think of a song on the radio can be tempered dramatically by learning more about the artistic intentions of the songwriter. For example, without the pithy and erudite revelations found in Andre The Giant’s liner notes for Joni Mitchell’s magnum opus “Ladies of the Canyon,” I would have never known that “Big Yellow Taxi” was not a metaphorical comment on the civilizational destruction of natural beauty, but rather a cry for help from desperate woman in the depths of a toxic obsession with livery cabs.  Or that Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” was really about a colonoscopy gone wrong.","createDate":"1763146839","updateDate":"1763174093","approveDate":"1763146840","recommendations":6,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146653463","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.48516732454299927}

Faster than people used to.  More than people used to.\n\nI've also said that in the past, to do well on crosswords, you've got to know stuff.  I never said you had to learn it in school.  Most people are tripped up by things you can learn by watching the news, reading People magazine, watching videos on YouTube, and just learning about things around you, especially things you're not that interested in.  For example, I have no use for rap or opera in real life, but rarely get tripped up on either type of clue.  \n\nSurely, there will be people who feel like you, and probably more than usual right now, because the NYT is running an aggressive sign-up campaign.

It was something I said on a different thread.  But I still didn't say anyone can do it that fast.  I said that touch typing is the way to get that fast.  (Of course, on top of everything else I just talked about.)\n\nMy point was that Kate in the other thread said that she could never enter the clues that fast on any puzzle.  I was responding to that.\n\nPutting it another way, let's say you could enter the answers orally, taking the time spent entering the answers down to practically zero.  If you can complete a really easy Monday puzzle that way in about 3 minutes, you could still solve that fast (or within mere seconds of it) if you can read the next clue while entering each answer.  I was saying that it can be done physically, not that anyone was capable of doing it.\n\nMost younger people these days have never learned to touch type.  That would make it harder to improve past maybe 5-6 minutes.\n\nAnd all this is predicated that the solver is good enough to spit out the answers to practically every clue nearly instantaneously.

I also don't pretend I'm learning the trivia I look up, or that it's worth learning in the first place - sure, sometimes I'll remember some name, but what worth has knowing some brand that's not even in the shops over here?\n\nI also occasionally look up unknown words, especially American slang.\n\nI never seek aid with witty clues and misdirection.\n\nI generally don't look up spanners, either.","createDate":"1763113281","updateDate":"1763182513","approveDate":"1763113282","recommendations":15,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146638426,"parentUserDisplayName":"Gareth","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146638742","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-14","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5653627514839172}

I don’t mean that I “disagree” in the sense of having a negative opinion about how *you* solve *your* own puzzles — what difference could that possibly make to me? (And for the record, I am thoroughly impressed by the fact that you do these puzzles at all.)\n\nRather, I imagine newer solvers coming to this forum and reading the comments in which you advocate for your own approach to trivia handling in a principled manner. Particularly coming from a commenter who anyone will immediately recognize as being very active and well-liked among the “community” (and who, to boot, happens to be a very effective, engaging English writer), such comments are surely music to the ears of many a frustrated noob.\n\nBuuut…I also happen to know from personal experience that climbing the crossword-solving learning curve, in its full glory, can be a highly satisfying journey. And for that, at some point you’ve gotta “climb without the rope” and learn how to get opaque entries from crosses.\n\nSo, IMO your “just look it up, and ignore the elitists who say otherwise” comments deserve some pushback.","createDate":"1763125671","updateDate":"1763174488","approveDate":"1763125673","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146638492,"parentUserDisplayName":"Gareth","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146641145","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.544097900390625}

What does it matter to me what some chain eatery is called? Or what the mascot of some team is? Or what some actor who died before I was born was called? Should I abandon a solve because the constructor or editors thought it would be a great idea to cram 5 items of trivia into an area with 7 entries total? (And that has happened on multiple occassions, including Tuesday last week, iirc). How am I to deal with that without Google?

It’s fair to say that being from Poland there will always be more Americanisms and American trivia that he won’t know and I certainly don’t expect him to memorize it all. But we differ in our general approach to “trivia”. For one thing he uses that to include anything that he isn’t interested in or is relevant to his life—we had a discussion about that with imaginary numbers (math seems to be bit of a block for him). And I have found it amazing the number of trivial things I have learned that have come up to be useful later on, not just at crosswords but in life, if for nothing else as a way to connect with people. So I do encourage new solvers to be open to learning about things they don’t know, and not being so quick to look up because often they eventually can get them on crosses or have a flash of insight or memory that they didn’t realize at first. It is a learning process.

I think there’s a difference between complaining about something being too easy and commenting about it, and also considering the clues vs the fill. In my comments I specifically called out the first clue as being a total gimme which really does annoy me; and the cluing overall was not very inspired. But I also said the grid itself was well constructed and had a lot of interesting entries. So I don’t mind some Fridays being a little easier, but I think it’s OK to constructively suggest that the clues could have been more geared to that day; and I also put that more on the editors because they are more responsible for calibrating the clues.","createDate":"1763128574","updateDate":"1763165837","approveDate":"1763128575","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146638890,"parentUserDisplayName":"A Pedant","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146642732","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5970725417137146}

I played them on one of those plastic portable stereos that closed up and had a handle...it was a mustard yellow. I remember learning of a new album release, and anxiously awaiting the moment to buy it, a fresh platter of vinyl, shiny, no dust, no scratches and would shut myself up in my tiny bedroom to hear it for the first time. While taking in the music I loved so much, I&#39;d read the album cover, often featuring original art work, to find out all the players: backup singers, musicians, writers, contributors of all types, and of course, the lyrics. I loved knowing  all those details. (Yes, I&#39;m a movie credits reader too.) When music went to cassette tapes, sometimes you might find a little booklet stuffed in the case. Then came CDs and downloads, so just the music pretty much.  Over the years and multiple moves my little collection was lost, but I am grateful I can find it all through streaming, and new music too, but the depth and richness with which I experienced it back then, is missed.","createDate":"1763149931","updateDate":"1763174095","approveDate":"1763149931","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146653463,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ace","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146654635","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8089734315872192}
