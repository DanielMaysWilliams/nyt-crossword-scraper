Tortiseshell coats occur due to X-inactivation—portions of genetic code are inactivated on an X chromosome, allowing non-orange expression from the other X chromosome to get peppered in with orange expression. The pattern of inactivation is random, resulting in the mottled appearance of Torties. Because this requires two X chromosomes, most Torties are female, but Klinefelter males can be as well.\n\nMeanwhile, white-spotting is a deactivation of any melanin production. It occurs in early fetal development and has a fairly predictable progression, affecting first the chest, then paws, neck, chin, belly. The top of the head, along the spine, and finally the tail are the last parts affected by white-spotting. The extent of white-spotting is rife with sartorial descriptors: locket, mitts, boots, mask and mantle, cap and saddle, and of course, tuxedo!","createDate":"1712752923","updateDate":"1712810228","approveDate":"1712752925","recommendations":12,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132448913","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8518585562705994}

Practice makes improvement! \n\nFor Sam:\nAcids usually have a H in their structure that can be given away as H+ ions. Organic acids all have a -COOH group attached to them. Vinegar (acetic acid aka ethanoic acid), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and oleic acid all follow this pattern. They donate the H to the solution they are in, making it acidic (pH is a measurement of the concentration of H+ ions). When the H is gone, they become a polyatomic ion made of many atoms (essentially the rest of the molecule minus the acidic H). When they have done this, the suffix changes to -ate instead of -ic acid. This is where OLEATE comes from in today's puzzle. It the same concept as HCl becoming H+ and Cl- but with fancier organic molecules. \n\nBonus fact, I bet that's where the inspiration for the brand name Olay comes from, phonetically.","createDate":"1712791044","updateDate":"1712884366","approveDate":"1712791046","recommendations":7,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132463818","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-10","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8321552872657776}
