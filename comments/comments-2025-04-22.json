(Eg. coöperate) Whereas an umlaut looks similar to a diaeresis, but it marks a single vowel as having a softer or shorter pronunciation. The Brontë family were descended from the Irish clan Ó Pronntaigh and their name was originally anglicized as Brunty, but Patrick Brontë, father to Charlotte and Emily, changed the spelling, perhaps to better approximate the original Irish, perhaps to lend the family name a foreign mystique, or perhaps because he was an early fan of Mötley Crüe. Either way, because it marked a single e, it is an umlaut and not a diaeresis, or if you prefer, a diëresis.","createDate":"1745373330","updateDate":"1745405092","approveDate":"1745373331","recommendations":6,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141640426","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8748378157615662}
