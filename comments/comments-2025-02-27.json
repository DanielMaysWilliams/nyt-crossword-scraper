Dharma is a five-letter word, because “dh” is a single letter.\nT/TH, B/BH. Buddha is B-u-d-dh-a. Siddhartha is S-i-d-dh-a-r-th-a. Gandhi is G-a-n-dh-i.\n\nThis is a common thing when transcribing letters from other alphabets:\nHebrew: חַלָּה, challah (bread) distinguishes the letter CH from the letter H, which are both distinct single letters in Hebrew.\nUkrainian / Russian: борщ, borshch/borscht (soup) uses the four letters shch to denote the sound of the single letter щ in Roman spelling. Polish uses a different four letters for the same: szcz.\n\nThe letter H is always brought in to show aspiration or affrication - breath complications, softenings. So T contrasts with TH, S with SH, D with DH, B with BH, etc.\n\nJodhpur(s) is an ordinary word to horse folks and fashionistas.

The puzzle key kindly agreed with me... so I cleared the puzzle and timer and refilled it in with double rebuses again only to have it give me the Grr message...  Flummoxed was I! So, I emptied my rebus squares and just put the U in each and changed nothing else. Voila! The dunce's music!  Strange!\n\nFrom Deb's comments, it seemed like I was right to enter the U and the items.  Crazy! I've not had this happen to me before. \n\nAh well, I guess I now have a new personal best for Thursday because of the refill. \n\nAnyhow, aside from the ending tech SASS, I thought it was a cute and clever theme, I liked filling the POCKETS a lot!
