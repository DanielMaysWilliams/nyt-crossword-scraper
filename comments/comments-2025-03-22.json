It has enough play in it to not be boring, and yet it’s not so random as to be un-noticeable. Pairs of blocks, half horizontal and half vertical, truly, a CONTROLLED CHAOS, and I wonder if that answer amidst this design is no accident.\n\nThis was a faith solve for me, where I kept running into no-knows, but kept telling myself that the constructor and NYT team put it together fairly, and that if I stuck with it, there would be a happy ending.\n\nIt turned out to be a Jenga solve, where the puzzle stood firm for a period, firmly fighting me even as I chipped away plugging answers in.  Then, suddenly, it fell in a massive heap after I filled one of the spanners.  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  A thrilling maxi-splat.  \n\nAlong the way, shimmering beauty in those four spanners, the frisson of pop (five NYT debuts, four once-befores, and three twice-befores), and lovely cluing, including the sing-song [Snicker bit] for HEH, and the uber-misdirecting [Royal adversary] for TWIN. \n\nA splendid Saturday.

In high school in Poland we have what we call profil, a profile, much like your major in college. My class (as in, the group of 30 people who stayed together in all courses for the whole 4 years of high school) profile was the humanities, and giving us a demanding math teacher had to have ended in disaster. So we got a new guy, who appreciated us for who we were. I still did not enjoy math, and I learned very little of it, but the teacher himself was a great guy and I liked and respected him.

The official propaganda was: \"Everything is perfect! If something appears to not be perfect, it's rot from the West and not our fault!\". \n\nIn the early 90s I was a teen at school, and we had all those talks you must have had over in the US too: \"Drugs, cigarettes and alcohol are bad, m'kay?\" There was this quite famous poster <a href=\"https://pagowski.pl/pl/p/PAPIEROSY-SA-DO-DUPY/102\" target=\"_blank\">https://pagowski.pl/pl/p/PAPIEROSY-SA-DO-DUPY/102</a> about cigarettes, and there must have been ones about drugs, too, and I just don't recall them. There was low-key talk at my high school in the second half of the 90s about drug use, and one of my classmates was supposed to be a drug dealer, but none of it ever interested me and nobody bothered me about it. The press ran shocking articles about heroin addiction, but it was not like any of it was really visible daily in Warsaw.\n\nAt uni at the turn of the 90s and 00s, I heard about some people taking drugs to help them study, but that's about it. There was no marijuana culture, for example. I was quite boring, I didn't go to parties etc., so I may have missed something, but \"something\" did not seek me out.\n\nThese days things are different, maybe, but since I don't have children, I'm not up-to-date on much of what makes current Polish culture and counter-culture.

The thing was, for a drug to be banned, it had to be officially recognized by the government as a drug. The procedure to do that took a long time. So whenever something new appeared on the market, it was unregulated, by definition. Soon enough the law was amended, and the \"booster\" shops were no more.\n\nAt present Polish police is severely understaffed (many people left the force during the democractic backsliding of 2015-2023, because they didn't want to beat up protesters or track down women having abortions, and given the police's bad press, nobody signed up to join anymore; democracy has been restored, but the police's problems persist), so they can't be bothered chasing around teens smoking weed, which is probably why we smell it in our neighborhood in the evenings and at night, and occasionally during the day, too.","createDate":"1742643851","updateDate":"1742681119","approveDate":"1742643853","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140797828,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nora","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140797965","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-22","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6053444743156433}
