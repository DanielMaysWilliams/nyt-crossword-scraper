If I were to recommend a single place to visit in Poland it would definitely be Kraków.\n\nWarsaw was an ugly, sad and dangerous city in the 1990s, but it has almost completely transformed into a vibrant, interesting and safe place. It's not more worthy of a visit than Kraków, but I think few visitors wouldn't find something cool in it for themselves.\n\nToruń and Malbork (the town with the world's largest brick castle) are fascianting, too.\n\nThere are some other gems along the river, too. Kazimierz nad Wisłą (150 km from Warsaw) is a charming old town, popular for day trips.

The musical contribution of Poles is given its due, and it's a very interesting hour with an up-to-date view of the country. You'll see why Warsaw had appeal for me, even with the vestiges of communistic architecture. Apart from the interesting new buildings, parks and markets, they've added some color to the drab old blocks.

It refers to the number of runs scored as a result of a batter’s turn at bat, usually because he got a hit, but not exclusively. (The other reasons are not necessary to go into here,)\n\nAs I’m sure you know by now, there are three bases that a runner can be stationed at as a result of a hit or other favorable result for the team at bat. So when a batter comes up, if any of those runners (including the batter himself) scores, the batter is credited with an RBI or RBIs. \n\nFor example, if there is a runner on second base, and the batter gets a hit that allows that runner to score, the batter gets an RBI. If there are runners on first and second, and let’s say the batter hits a triple (that is, he can get to third base on a long hit), all the other runners score, and he gets two RBIs. If there are three runners on base (“bases loaded”) and the batter hits a home run (almost always, the ball clears the outfield fence), he and all three runners score, and the batter has four RBIs, the most possible on one turn at bat. This is called a grand slam. \n\nOn April 23, 1999, Fernando Tatis got to bat twice in a very long inning and hit two grand slams in the same inning, resulting in eight RBIs in the same inning. This is a record that might possibly be tied one day, but unlikely ever to be broken. \n\nHope this information isn’t clear as mud to you!","createDate":"1744196241","updateDate":"1744248396","approveDate":"1744196242","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141279766,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141280253","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9026610851287842}

I began eating a keto diet a year ago, which morphed into semi-carnivore. I eat mostly animal products plus a few veg and berries. Part of this meant giving up milk (too high in lactose). I hate black coffee so added butter. Tastes fab. I need to add salt to my diet as I don’t eat processed foods, so added that too. It really does taste great. Kind of like adding salt to chocolate, that sweet/salt combo works well. \n\nWhy keto? By dropping carbs I’ve reversed T2 diabetes, to my Dr.’s surprise.
