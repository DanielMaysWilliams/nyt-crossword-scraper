That's not a complaint! \n\nI was surprised that the biologists who piped up about ALGAE yesterday are absent re: 29D. Note: I have no problem at all with the clue and answer, but I am hoping some folks here might find these details interesting. If not, scroll on past...\n\nTechnically, echinoderms are bilateral. However, since most have adopted a sedentary existence, and there is no need for a front end, they have secondarily (over evolutionary history) become radial -- sort of. Many textbooks will describe them as pentaradial, reflecting that most have a five-part symmetry. But wait -- what about Leptasterias, the six-armed sea star (note: most biologists don't call them starfish, since they are not fish. This is similar to most biologists never, ever using the execrable \"octopi\" as the plural of octopus) or... some species of Luidia, which have seven arms - or more! Or the sunflower star, my favorite Pycnopodia -- you should google this. Up to a couple dozen arms, and large, and lovely. Etc. etc.\n\nBut most adult echinoderms have a distinct radial symmetry. So the clue and answer are fine. Oh - what about that little button on the top - the madreporite? Off-center.... this makes it actually bilateral. \n\nI could continue with a discussion of sea cucumbers and sand dollars, but the clue referred to sea stars, so.. \n\nAll echinoderm larvae are distinctly bilateral, reflecting the bilateral history of the group as a whole.
