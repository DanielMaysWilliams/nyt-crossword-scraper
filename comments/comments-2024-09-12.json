Today, I’m thinking it was the BS start of BSIDE.  Oh, there are other answers that start this way (i.e., BSHARP, BSTUDENT, BSDEGREE), but not many.\n•\tA trove of smile-producing clues; I especially liked [It might cause some unsurprised looks] for BOTOX.\n•\tLoved OTAKU because I didn’t know it, thus it was satisfying to correctly fill in, not to mention that it looks cool, and is worth remembering.\n\nSo, lots of juice in the box today – a rich experience for me.

Top right corner got to me.  Although xxASKAROLL, I should have gotten it!\n\nJust picking a nit - SPAYING and NEUTERING are two different things (the former is performed on females, the latter on males).\n\nSometimes it's abbreviated SPEUTERING in the animal rescue community when we're talking about the general practice in the context of reducing births to avoid overpopulation which results in healthy animals being killed in shelters - which by the way is at epidemic levels right now.  So if you have room in your home to foster a dog or cat even for a little while, contact a local non-profit rescue groups and volunteer.  They will pay all the medical bills, most will pay for food, and you'll be saving a life!  Rescue groups  usually don't have brick and mortar facilities, so they can't pull animals from shelters without foster homes ready to take them.  The rescue group will take back the foster animal if you cannot keep it until it is adopted.","createDate":"1726171974","updateDate":"1726950860","approveDate":"1726171978","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136144269","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-12","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8555522561073303}
