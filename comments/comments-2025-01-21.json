You can even park in most Walmart lots overnight if you're between destinations.\n\nYou don't have to rely on restaurant food, which is much more expensive than making your own wherever you park, either outdoors on a fire, or in your own kitchen.\n\nAnd unlike hotel rooms, when you're done using your RV, you can sell it and get at least some of the money you paid for it back.\n\nAnd you need a vehicle to get to where you're going, anyway.
