When the kids put out mason jars to measure rainfall, we called them \"little unwells\" (that's how we roll at J-ez's crib) -- neither kid grew up to be a scientist. But MEDIUM RARE is an even better answer. Chef's (the) kiss!\n\nWhat did we do with the water in the rain barrel? Every so often I would happen by it, on the side of our house and stop to peer into its clear depths. It was a true wooden barrel with staves of oak, belted with iron, picked up at a flea back in the nineties. I stopped up the many leaks with some tarry goop that turned the inside greenish black. Then I would push up my sleeves and use both hands to give my face a good rain rinse, with its scents of ozone, cloud and Pittsburgh (coal, coke, steak & fries atop your salad, kolbasi, smoky sweat) -- it woke me to the core. Then I'd wrestle the barrel to its side; the water eagerly gushed down the driveway. Months, maybe even a year would pass before I'd do it again. \n\n--a rich puzzle spiced with unusual words. As others have said, GOL was a great subtle mockery of our steady diet of OLEs.

He couldn't think of anything but he said he think about it... and also ask the bar manager... \n\nHe came back a little while later with my martini, no need to mention that it was a gin martini... Hahaha... And said to try tongs number one, or, tulip.\n\nHuzzah! It was tongs! I have never in a million years would have thought of that!! \n\nI mean, It's technically a cheat, but screw that, huzzah!!\n\nAlso this puzzle includes the answer SAPID for like pleasing the palate or some such.

I've solved on all of those, but the only way to get down to under three minutes is to sit up razor-straight at a desktop.\n\n4. Shut out all distractions.  If all you need is less than three minutes, this is usually doable at some point in the day.  Mine is when the Mrs. goes to bed before I do.\n\n5. And of course, experience.  This only happens if you answer practically every clue correctly immediately the first time around, and for the few you don't know, to skip immediately.  \n\nI don't really speed solve, although I occasionally try to pick up the pace on an early-week puzzle when I get off to a good start.

Wins and losses are a statistical category for pitchers, and they are abbreviated W and L.  Which pitcher in any game (as there are usually several) gets the win or takes the loss is statistically determined by a set of rules.  So the pitcher who loses the game statistically is said to TAKE THE L. \n\nBaseball is a game that is played every day of the week, for the most part, through a six-month regular season, and then, if a team is good, another month-plus of playoffs.  There are times when a team is getting beaten so badly that the manager no longer wants to use his best pitchers, so he brings in the lowest guy on the totem pole for \"mopping up\" duties, or even uses a non-pitcher to do this.  The manager knows that it's better to concede a game he isn't going to win anyway, and save his better pitchers for the next day.  In that case, you can say that the manager has decided to TAKE THE L and move on.

Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a book, ‘Wait Till Next Year,” about growing up in 1950s NY. It reflected a lot of what my mom told me of her childhood in Brooklyn and Queens in the 30s and 40s. A lot of it focused on her relationship with her father and how they bonded over their team, the Dodgers, rivals of the Giants and Yankees, and how loyalties followed neighborhood lines.
