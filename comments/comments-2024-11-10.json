And was a massive popular and critical success on top of that. It is well remembered to this day.\n\nWii Play is a terrible collection of glorified tech demos. It is widely hated, and many people only ended up owning it because it came free if you bought a second controller in PAL territories. It is not a \"hit\" by any definition of the word (except that you hit a billiard ball in one of the minigames).\n\nAccording to Mobygames' \"Mobyscore\" metric (based on contemporary critical reviews) , Wii Play is ranked 22136 of ~25.6K Wii games.

As an elegant touch, he made sure that the only question-mark clues in the across answers were theme answer clues.\n\nIt’s also, IMO, a capital-P Puzzle, issuing the challenge: “Crack me!” So many vague clues, clues that could yield several answers, and misdirects. Also, those theme answers weren’t easy to come by. I had a few I’M DYING moments, and overcoming them, as always, was supremely satisfying.\n\nMy favorite clue was the misdirect [It’s attached to covers and sheets] for SPINE, which had me retrieving bed instead of book terms.

For a week afterward, my thoughts were thick, slow and fuzzy. Reading was almost impossible: the words looked like arranged lines of stones and pebbles, without apparent meaning or connection.\n\nI hope this isn't a political comment that will get bagged by the emus and editors, but after Tuesday, which was a disaster for me and my family, I felt the same way, muddy and dumb. People would talk to me and I'd be unable to comprehend what they said. I refused to read any news, and even worse, I couldn't manage the crossword puzzles. I left yesterday's largely incomplete after three hours' toil. Today's took me 2:25, a minor victory on the road to recovery. I'm wondering if other puzzlers have had a similar experience. \n\nOn to the puzzle itself. Usually I don't light up when I see Sam Ezersky's name. I've been put off by what I saw as braggadocio, lack of humility. This one had none of that, the cluing gentle and funny.

IMO puzzle would have benefitted from less ambition on the theme density to get cleaner fill overall.  I hadn't looked at the puzzle title and thought a lot of the theme entries were just poorly worded!  Understanding the theme improved my impression of the puzzle, but I think limiting the theme set to ones where the meaning is really shifted and the word-break is in the middle of a word would have been better. So DISSOLVING, EXPENSIVE, and PROVISION are pretty good.  PAN-AFRICAN and SUPERHEATED are relatively lame flips of compound words.  And ANTE-PENULTIMATE feels like a big stretch.  Going for fewer and better theme entries might have made it possible to avoid fill like CROSSEST, YESBABE, and ADDY and not putting ONETON and ONEMONTH in the same puzzle (neither of which are great fill anyway).

But I did like a few of the theme answers a lot and that's swayed me.\n\nI liked it but wasn't over the moon for it like I was our shared favorite. I found it a nice distraction and a challenge. Guess I'm satisfied with that, at least these days.\n\nI'm a very sort of try to see all sides kind of person so I've had a hard time wanting to say that people who finish it later and complain more had a harder time, etc. Some days because of life and such, I can't finish them till later, myself, so it's hard for me to want to conclude that but, I dunno. You might be right! Lately, I don't know what's what.\n\nAt least a couple times a week I think that I shouldn't bother with comments out here anymore. Too many of them are too much for me. I love peace and I love puzzles and somehow I think they should go together but they often don't.\n\nAlso, maybe I should stop drinking martinis tonight and go to bed.\n\nCheers!! 🍸🍸🍸","createDate":"1731305112","updateDate":"1731317638","approveDate":"1731305116","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137507852,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jim","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137507897","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-10","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5081358551979065}
