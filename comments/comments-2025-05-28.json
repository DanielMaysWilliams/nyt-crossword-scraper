At the time, the fact that fire is a necessary element in maintaining a healthy forest wasn't understood; it burns away underbrush, and the ash contributes to the soil. There are also some tree seeds that need exposure to the heat of a fire as part of their life cycle.\n\nThe efforts of the Forestry Service were successful in that they did prevent fires from starting for long periods. Unfortunately, this caused large buildups of underbrush. When a fire did eventually start, that buildup caused more intense fires, which caused large trees to burn that normally would have survived the fires. So Smokey, for all his good intentions, was making matters worse.\n\nThe Forestry Service conducts periodic controlled burns now in order to maintain forests and keep underbrush from accumulating to dangerous levels.","createDate":"1748434354","updateDate":"1748476343","approveDate":"1748434355","recommendations":17,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142433741","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7540250420570374}

The theme reminded me of a story:\n\nIn my second job after college, I had a boss whose wife fancied herself a singer. Even before I met her, I knew all about the career she’d walked away from to marry him, as an operatic soprano. It couldn’t have been much of a career, as they married when she was 17, but so be it. \n\nI met her at my first holiday party for my division at the company, at my boss’s boss’s house. More than once, people said, “Oh, you must sing for us.” She demurred a couple of times but at one point whispered to her husband, “Did you bring the music?” He had and went out to their car to retrieve it. After he brought it in, he sat at the piano in the living room, she stood beside him and, after a few introductory notes, began to sing the song that gives us our theme today…badly, full of exaggerated pronunciations (it was not sunrise, sunset, but sun-ah-rise, sun-ah-set, with the emphasis on the “ah”) and many missed notes. After two painful songs (mercifully, I forget the second one), I said to my wife, “Don’t we need to get back for the sitter?” \n\nEven now, nearly 50 years later, I cannot think of that song without hearing her voice.","createDate":"1748437370","updateDate":"1748476567","approveDate":"1748437370","recommendations":11,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142435006","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.559016227722168}

Flowed nice and smoothly throughout, but I ended up being hard locked out of the NW corner due to an unfortunate confluence of unknowable variants and unknown cultural references. \n\nEvery time I’ve seen the rare blood type clue it’s been ONEG (which I believe is also the rarest), so I had that instead of ANEG. I’ve also rarely (ever?) encountered the spelling INEZ before, so I had INES there (that one might be because I’m Canadian - I assume Inez is more common in Spanish speaking areas).\n\nI happen not to know Count Basie or Charlie Parker, and I couldn’t guess the genre from my incorrect _O__. I know the name ZZTOP but none of their songs, and I couldn’t guess the band from an incorrect _STOP. I’m not familiar with ZENO, nor am I strong on sailing terms - though I’m tickled to learn where the expression “I like the cut of your jib” comes from!\n\nWhile it felt like a preventable impasse (even “rarer blood type” would have given me a chance), and discovering that there was no path through which I could have solved it on my own was frustrating, I also recognise that it resulted from an incredibly specific set of misdirections and lack of knowledge that would have been tremendously difficult to envisage by anyone who didn’t happen to share them.

Also, censors tended to be quite reasonable (believe it or not, my maternal grandfather was responsible for censorship at Polish Radio :D). My father has been publishing books and articles since the late 60s, and before 1989 he had many conversations with censors. They often retracted their interventions when my father explained to them they changed the whole meaning of the text.\n\nAlso, works critical of the regime, both realist (like Wajda's Man of Marble, Człowiek z Marmuru, for example) and satirist (like the works of Lem, or the brilliant 1980s movie Seksmisja) were often not withheld by the censors. The regime understood the people needed to vent, so it let them.\n\nI just looked at the Polish original of that 11th voyage. The language used in the passages you mention is 17-18th century Polish, which was characterized by frequent use of Latin words, syntax much different from the modern one, and different spelling. It reads exactly like Nowe Ateny (New Athens), Poland's first encyclopaedia, published ca. 1750.
