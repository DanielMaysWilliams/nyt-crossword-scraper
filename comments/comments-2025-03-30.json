I’ve NEVER said or possibly even heard someone say, “I won 20 CLAMs off the scratch off ticket”. Perhaps it’s just my neck of the woods, but CLAM doesn’t make sense to me at all lol!

First is when you are in a key which has a sharp or flat as part of that key.  So for example, when in the key of G, an  F is assumed to be sharp and that is indicated at the start of the piece and one never sees the # when reading the music.  So in the music sheet if at some point you want the musician to play a normal F without the sharp you have to put in the natural sign to let them know not to sharpen it in that instance.    \n Second, if within a measure you add a sharp to a note, e.g., a G#,  that sharp is assumed to remain until the end of the measure (so you do not keep putting in the # sign for G during that measure after the first one).  But if you want to remove that sharp from the G in that measure, you need to add the natural symbol to undo the change. \n\nOthers can correct me if I am wrong!","createDate":"1743303906","updateDate":"1743393861","approveDate":"1743303908","recommendations":25,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141004655,"parentUserDisplayName":"Cat Lady Margaret","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141004876","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7709315419197083}

The key of C major has no sharps or flats, but most other keys have at least one sharp or flat.  The key signature is identified on the left of each line of the staff.  The key of D major, as in Pachelbel’s Canon in D, has an F sharp and a C sharp.  In order to stay in the right key, the musician must play every D and C as sharp.   \n\nThus, when the music needs an adjustment to a note, called an accidental, you might use a sharp, flat, or natural sign, depending n the note and the key the piece was written in.  If I recall correctly, these accidental signs only impact the note they appear next to.  \n\nHope this helps.  It’s been years since I read music.  I’m sure that David Connell could do a much better job explaining this.  \n\nBy the way, great write up over at Crossword Fiend!","createDate":"1743304990","updateDate":"1743363583","approveDate":"1743304992","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141004064,"parentUserDisplayName":"Cat Lady Margaret","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141005014","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8916687965393066}

He recovered quickly though, working with my physio. Since then he's also been much more careful around the house, and he's keeping very fit for a man in his mid 70s, walking hundreds of kilometers per month (for example, he walks the 4 km to the district city hall where he is a councillor, and another 4 km to his favorite shop; during the warm months he cycles everywhere, for example on a 40+ km roundtrip to my mother's grave. His quite nice car remains largely unused). Being fit was probably what saved him in that accident - his muscles took some of the stress of the fall, preventing fatal damage to the bone.\n\nWatching my mother die of cancer over 5 years in her late 60s was horrible. I think some of the cognitive problems I seem to be experiencing these days may have to do with how much hard liquor I drank then... My liver was close to going kaput, too. When I finally went to have it examined, the doctor pointed to a tiny spot on her screen: \"See that there? That bit there is the only part of your liver that's healthy,\" she said.

Took me about double my average time. There were some real toughies in there (and a couple of ridiculous clue/answer combos), but I wonder how many of those would have been at least semi-regular occurrences that were in the rotation. I would imagine age has a lot to do with it. I was 11 when that 1995 debuted, so the older references and outdated language were pretty difficult for me to figure out. I needed several lookups. If that puzzle had debuted today, there would have been 1000 comments saying how unfair it was. If today's puzzle debuted in 2055, I could imagine it seeming just as difficult to that audience. \n\nStill, it was pretty fun, and if it taught me one thing, there are three absolutes in this life - death, taxes, and OREO being an answer to a clue.
