The same problem would occur if a painting of a bugler playing a bugle in military uniform were called ‚ÄúThe Trumpeter.‚Äù\n\nThe position of the fingers (showing a nominal F natural being played) is so accurate and natural that it proves that the young musician sent to Manet‚Äôs studio was really a fifer and that Manet knew how to see as well as how to paint.\n\nArchibald Willard‚Äôs famous painting ‚ÄúThe Spirit of ‚Äô76‚Äù, aka ‚ÄúYankee Doodle‚Äù, includes two side drummers and a fifer, showing a flag bearer in the background on a battlefield.
