If it exists at all, even if not the most common iteration, it is kosher, unlike Zabar's.\n\nThe following Google Ngram shows that while less popular by a margin of about 3-1, the \"don't\" version has appeared in print, and has maintained a fairly steady level of usage since about 2005.  \n\n<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yaf7pj2u\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/yaf7pj2u</a>\n\nNote that the \"don't\" version only came into existence after 1980.  Since you have lived in the South for nearly 40 years, it's possible that it's people younger than you who use the \"don't\" version, and you miss it because you tend to talk to older people more frequently.\n\nAlso, note that the Ngrams document written usage, which usually follows oral usage by a decade or two.\n\nIf you Google the \"don't\" version, you'll find some examples of it among the far greater number of examples of the \"won't\" version.  Clearly, the \"won't\" version is the normal one, but if there's evidence that the other one exists, it's a valid crossword answer.\n\nYes, the bar is that low.

Who is he talking about? And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It's sort of their golden oldie, you know. It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.\"\n\nI misremembered it as the more succinct, flavorful \"That dog don't hunt,\" but I'm informed by very smart people it's actually \"That dog WON'T hunt.\" It is the considered choice of the dog to hunt, not its pacifist nature or inability to hunt, that is the crux; there's a crucial difference between a dog that don't hunt and one that won't hunt. \n\nFondly, because of the real engagement in that debate, in contrast to current political discourse. Plus, Dole kept it close enough to give us J. Farrell's 11-5-96 masterpiece puzzle (you could fill in either BOB DOLE or CLINTON - ELECTED correctly).\n\nJoe Biden & Don Trump...8 letters each.
