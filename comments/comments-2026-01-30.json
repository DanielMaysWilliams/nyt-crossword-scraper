She has a knack for using words in their less common meanings, which must be why seasoned American solvers love her grids. However, for a non-native speaker the challenge is less enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I like and appreciate misdirection, but the more levels it comes on, the harder it is for me to deal with it. \n\nStill, I almost managed to solve the puzzle unaided. It took longer than a full Saturday solve, but in 40 minutes I filled almost the whole grid.\n\nA single mistake in the still largely empty NE corner was my downfall. I had entered STOOD for \"Stopped lying\" (that was a nice clue btw!), and chaos ensued. The O of STOOD led to my (tentatively) entering OTIS for the transportation company - lifts are a form of transport in rhe wider sense, aren't they? It seemed a Weintraubian-enough answer to me. The T of STOOD in turn had me enter (TOP)STARCAST. There was just no way out of this mess I had created by erring. I knew I had made a mistake, but where?\n\nOf course I had no idea what the Annapolis clue was referencing, so I looked it up in desperation. PLEBE... That was enough for me to catch all my mistakes. \n\nA Robyn Weintraub Friday solved with one lookup?
