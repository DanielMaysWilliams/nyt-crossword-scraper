A Wednesday from November 23, 2022. I probably did that one but had forgotten. That one was unusual in that all of theme clues were just a string of colored circles. One clue example was a string of circles - (red, yellow and green) - and the answer was - TRAFFICLIGHT. In another one the clue circles were - (red, yellow, blue, green and black) and the answer was OLYMPICRINGS.

In that seal the eagle’s head is facing to the observer’s right toward a talon holding arrows. The official seal has since been changed so the eagle faces the other way toward the olive branch, but the original design remains on the desk.
