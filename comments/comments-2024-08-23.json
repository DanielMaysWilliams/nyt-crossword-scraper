All I had was sine, for a long time.\n\nStop for “organ piece” was, for this professional organist, an interesting entry.\n\n“Pulling out all the stops” is a relatively well-known expression and comes from the world of the pipe organ. On a pipe organ, a row of pipes that make the same sound but at different pitches is a “rank”. The pipes in a rank are sitting on top of a chest of pressurized air so that, when a key is pressed, a valve opens to admit air to the pipe corresponding to that key. But there is a slip of wood with holes drilled in it that slides back and forth, either closing off the flow of air (stopping it) or admitting air (opening it) to that rank. When the knob for a rank or group of ranks is pulled out, the holes line up and the pipe gets air and sounds: so “pulling out all the stops” means “the whole shebang”: letting every sound sound; nothing held back.\n\nA good organist knows to unleash that full sound judiciously, so that the power of the instrument is held in check until the right moment.

Always nice to see one of the jazzy Jones Brothers in a puzzle. Thad trumpet, brother Hank piano, & of course Elvin drums. Classic.\n\nJust, a very good, crunchy enough, sneaky enough, solid Friday puzzle. I liked BIGPICTURE & AREYOUKIDDINGME & WORE for 'rocked' & lots of others. Very good.\n\nI first (correctly) had SOLACE @ 43D, then some incorrect crosses led me to tear it out & put SOothE, which I eventually replaced with SOLACE again. When I first filled that entry tho I couldn't help but think of one of my absolute favorite Scott Joplin pieces \"Solace: A Mexican Serenade\". A gorgeous, lilting, sweet, captivating (non-rag) piece. At the very start of the pandemic in Spring 2020— & later as well— to get exercise I would sometimes dance around my aprtmnt to random danceable stuff on classical radio WFMT, & that one always got me up & swaying around. (it's not that I didn't go outdoors at all at the time, it's just that March/April in Chicago— & some summer days too— aren't always \"take a nice walk\" weather). Anyway, here's the best performance I could find on YouTube, the contestant wiggles his shoulders & grins way too much for my taste but his actual musical performance is lovely, nice pace & dynamics. (You can ignore the visuals & just listen to the audio if you want!).\n\n43D: A Mexican Serenade\n(er, that's \"Solace: A Mexican Serenade\")\n\n🎶<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uzqu6KNfcPk?si=68m56nwkYOr8pCba\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/uzqu6KNfcPk?si=68m56nwkYOr8pCba</a>\n\nHe kinda pwns the piece!

Finally I had to just take the plunges and be prepared to alter or take them out, and voila, it started to fill up.  \n\nA couple of look-ups were inevitable—two names I didn't know, oWN refused to budge until I got the BIG PICTURE, and had to confirm PWN,and so it went, until it was, in all its perfection, done.\n\nA beauty of a puzzle, perfect for a Friday, and I do thank you, Taylor Johnson and Rafael Musa.  Please do get together again soon.","createDate":"1724388131","updateDate":"1724939601","approveDate":"1724388134","recommendations":31,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135650833","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-23","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4324553608894348}

I think that in order to get them you have to sign up for the easy mode newsletter. I think what Joel was saying is that if he gets stuck, rather than look up an answer he will refer to the easier clueset to get back on track.","createDate":"1724437331","updateDate":"1724455478","approveDate":"1724437334","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135660257,"parentUserDisplayName":"Joel","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135666833","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7715515494346619}

I started the regular puzzle last night and when I clicked the link for the easy mode this morning instead of opening in a webpage as usual it went back into the app and the puzzle I had already started with the clues the same. I gave up after several tries and just finished it 5 minutes faster than average!! I amazed myself that I didn’t need the help after all.","createDate":"1724437143","updateDate":"1724498418","approveDate":"1724437146","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135663507,"parentUserDisplayName":"Michael Zand","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135666750","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-23","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6556550860404968}
