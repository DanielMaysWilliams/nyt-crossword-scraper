As with most easy puzzles, I ignored the theme during the solve, but I didn't mind it when it emerged at the end - most themes that are not a set of groaners are OK with me.\n\nI like it when a puzzle will help me remember something new that I learned from a recent one. Only a few weeks ago I learned coins may be found in American sofas. Perhaps because Polish people usually change from street to home clothes as soon as they come in, coins don't accumulate in our sofas. For decades now I've been finding it very strange how Americans (on tv, anyway) will walk around their homes in street shoes, and even put them up on cushioned furniture... That's one of a Pole's biggest hygienic no-nos - hygiene is among the earliest topics of our education.\n\nI realized I didn't know how to spell the animation studio. I started putting in Hannah Barbera... And ran out of room with one letter to go. I waited for crosses to see what was wrong. Oooh, it's HANNA! Like the American climber Ben Hanna rather than Hannah Meul the German climber ü§£\n\nI also wanted RAMSeY rather than RAMSAY, but an alter is not a thing, is it.\n\nInterestingly, kapusta (cabbage) is Polish slang for money, too. According to one online theory, it is probably a mistaken loan (of sorts) from German. In German, Kohle (coal) may mean money, which sounds similar to Kohl (cabbage). A mistranslation may have occured on loaning the term.","createDate":"1751949527","updateDate":"1752036593","approveDate":"1751949527","recommendations":23,"replyCount":23,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143366505","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9011605381965637}
