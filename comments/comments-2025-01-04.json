Others say Bechameil improved on La Varenne's simple \"white sauce\" of flour, butter & milk, with a dash of nutmeg.  It wasn't until Vincent La Chapelle's \"The Modern Cook\" (1733) that it was called bechamel sauce. La Chapell's book first came out in English as a trial run; he didn't want it to appear in French till it was perfect. The resulting 4 volume set (1735) is the most important French 18th century culinary work. Bechamel is now considered one of five \"mother sauces\" of French cooking -- foundational sauces whose use and variations form the essence of French cuisine, the others being tomato, hollandaise, velouté & Espagnole. \n\nI entered bearnaise instead of bechamel, figuring it was dedicated to the Duke de Bearn.  As described above, however, bearnaise's \"mother\" is hollandaise. It's one of two major recipes \"accidentally\" invented by Jean-Louis-François Collinet in the 1830s (the other being puffed potatoes) so named because it was first served in a restaurant called Le Pavilion Henri IV in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, named thus because it was in a former residence of Henri IV (from Bearn).\n\nIt was common back then to dedicate recipes to wealthy patrons, just as authors, artists & composers did.

Ten debut answers. Just well above my pay grade and I think I cheated too much to count this one. Oh well - I think I'll just let my streak die tomorrow. No big deal. \n\nA couple of interesting puzzle finds today. One - a Sunday from June 13, 2010 by Francis Heaney with the title \"Flag day.\" Never seen one like this before. There were a number of 3 letter across answer squares where each square was supposed to be entered as a color rebus.  And for the down answers, they were just that color spelled out. As an example: \n\n1 down: MRBLUE\n2 down: EBWHITE\n3 down: TIRED\n\nBut then the across answers took those three squares to be the flag of some country and that country's name was supposed to be part of the across answer. For example, the colors at the end of 1, 2 and 3 down were supposed to represent the flag of FRANCE, so the answer at the crossing 22 across was implied to be: FRANCESBACON. A couple of other across answers with the 3 colored flag squares re-interpreted as the country: \nACQU(IRELAND)\nSAN(GUINEA)BOUT\nDIG(ITALY)EARBOOKS\n\nBut then the crossing down answers just used the name of the color as part of the answer. e.g.:\n\n(GREEN)TEA\n(YELLOW)ROSE\n(RED)UCER\n\nLIME(GREEN)\nALAN(WHITE)\nWEST(ORANGE)\n\nAnd... one crossing down answer was: \n\nBIG(YELLOW)TAXI\n\nOne other across answer with the implied country: \n\nPY(ROMANIA)CS\n\nMight put another puzzle find in a reply. \n\n....","createDate":"1735984656","updateDate":"1736027141","approveDate":"1735984660","recommendations":15,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138745910","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8377687931060791}

Typically I expect to want to argue with the cluing when I see Ezersky in the byline. Not today: in fact, I didn't realize who made the puzzle until I came to the Gameplay column. (Previously I have typically gotten a creeping sensation that drives me to check the top of the page.) The only clue that strained my credulity, and not much, was 32D's [Hesitant response...]. This puzzle felt uncharacteristically reasonable. There were a lot of proper names that didn't ring bells; still, I managed with only one Google run (for 14A), and none of the answers felt SHOCKING or left me CRAZEd.
