It also required me to get all the Across clues right immediately, so I only had to enter five answers.  Completing this Mini in 8 seconds was a complete and utter freak occurrence, and I couldn't imagine maintaining that pace for an entire Monday puzzle.  (I have been able to get others done in 9-10 seconds occasionally.)\n\nAnd even if I could maintain a rate of 8 seconds per 5x5 area, the Mini is 1/9 the size or a standard puzzle, so even that would be 72 seconds, or more than a minute, with no pauses or errors.\n\nMy Monday best (and therefore overall best) is more than double that rate.
