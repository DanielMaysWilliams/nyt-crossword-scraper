I wondered as I solved whether the puzzle’s texture was due to my not being fully awake yet, but judging from the comments, others got a bit of a workout, too. \n\nIDON’TKNOWCANYOU was a no-brainer with just the I in place, and so I have to whin… er… say: “Mom, CAN I (heh…) please get you out of my head? It’s 6am!” \n\nPARACHUTE and ARTFORGER, both brilliantly clued, offered some welcome pushback, as did—six-a.m.-edly perhaps—SKATEPARK which my brain stubbornly tried to make into something riparian, despite having almost all the crosses in place. \n\nIt was nice to see RUNES not clued as divination tools. One day my dream  will come true and a clue for RUNES will be written in Elder Futhark characters. Okay, maybe not. But maybe a MIRAGE will call for 11 letters in lieu of 6 and turn out to be Fata Morgana, a term I picked up in an adventure novel as a kid possessed of the dream to see the Sahara one day. Having now seen the Sahara, I have yet to see that eerie illusion where the sand meets the sky, so the romantic dream lives on in its new grid form, sans the camels. Oy, the camels. But that’s a story for another day. \n\nThe final bit of resistance came from ETHER. Although, as with the Saharan mirage, I’m not speaking from direct experience, there’s nothing numbing about ether’s effect on the body or the mind, so I needed all the crosses to fill it in.

YER?! Ye gods! And there was more of such arcana for me). That helped. I completed 3/4 of the grid then. Still, I needed reveals to handle the NE corner. (SAFETY) SCHOOL was completely alien to me, and I truly hated the clue for ART FORGER - there is nothing synthetic about works of art forgers, is there? They may be fake, but they are not synthetic. I get misdirection, but the price for it can't be resorting to falsehoods and abandoning sense.

He was staring intently at our back deck area, where we heard some commotion earlier in the morning. The deck area is slightly recessed under the upper porch, therefore we couldn’t see what he was looking at.\n  It turns out, he had chased a young doe, who made her refuge under the porch overhang, on our deck. Her hind end was pressed against the sliding glass doors, and she was soaking wet and trembling. It hadn’t rained all week, so maybe it was sweat, or morning dew, who knows. Fearful that she’d kick her hind legs through the glass, we just watched. She had a wound on her left shoulder, likely from struggling to escape the clutches of her suitor.

Michelangelo responded by putting his face on Minos' body, complete with donkey ears. Second funny story: After the great master's death, one of his students was commanded to paint over all the naughty bits, which earned him the nickname,  \"Il Braghettone,\" which means, \"the trouser maker.\" One last story: The artist painted his own face on the flayed skin of Saint Bartholomew, which dangles precariously over the bad place.

Somehow I pulled it off (without lookups) over a decades long period of time. Or at least it felt decades long toward the end. Har! \n\nIt seems that LASHUP has been around since the late 1800s but I would swear on a stack of tacos that I've never heard it. I had mASHUP there for a long time. And it took a real force of strength to stop thinking of Medicare Part B for seniors. And NATTERON took forever. I don't think I've ever heard that either but prattleon wasn't going to work... Had corER for a long time before taking it out and eventually getting to PARER. \n\nA lot of fun entries, like IDONTKNOWCANYOU, which was mercifully easy enough. I also like SPEEDS crossing READYSETGO. Really liked the clues for ITSMYTREAT and MIRAGE. Some things, I don't know how I plugged them in... like, I didn't know I knew them, such as KLEIN and COS. I'm the furthest thing from a mathematician (and I don't even play one on TV) but I just knew it was that. \n\nNow, ETHER had me confounded. \"Number\" has fooled me before. I just never think of an anesthetic as a number, maybe a numbing agent but I have to try to remember that one. It's a fun trick though, so I'm not mad. I mean, the day I actually get mad at a crossword puzzle is the day I should be sent out to pasture.\n\nHonestly, no idea how I got this done.

It's made by a person using real media. Look at it this way: plastic, fake wood panelling is artificial and synthetic. It is not wood - chemically, it is plastic, a synthetic material, artificially made to resemble wood. A faked Anguissola painting is neither artificial not synthetic, IMO.\n\nAt least that's how the equivalent words work in Polish. \"Sztuczny\" (\"artificial\") implies fakeness on a chemical, material level. Exactly the same is true for \"syntetyczny\". Bogus authorship of a work is neither sztuczne nor syntetyczne.
