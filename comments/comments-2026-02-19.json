The crossword editors work with constructors to improve their original submissions, and they can (and do) suggest alternative clues. \n\nIt's the clueing that determine the difficulty of the puzzle - the existence of easy mode for Friday puzzles demonstrates that.  If a difficult puzzle can be made easy by more straightforward clues, then the opposite is also true: an easier puzzle can be make harder with more subtle or trickier clues.  It's up to the editors to determine what level of cluing is appropriate for a particular day of the week.\n\nPersonally, I'm OK with an occasional easier puzzle - as long as it's only every now and then.

To me, when Shortz expanded the number of proper nouns, brand names, and cultural references into the puzzles, it greatly expanded the pool of words constructors could use. Personally, I would be bored to tears if the puzzle was just puns and wordplay and black diamond vocabulary. Shortz made me think I could actually solve the crème de la crème of crossword puzzles. And I love the daily progression because it gives me a goal to shoot for. It pushes me to learn new things like state capitals and river names and musical terms. After 4 years, I have become a Tuesday/ Wednesday solver, and I’m proud of that.
