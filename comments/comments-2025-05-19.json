As someone who relishes the gentle ramp-up into the week’s solving journey, I found this puzzle to be a delightful warm-up—like stretching before a long, rewarding run.\nThe theme was light and playful, centered around the phonetic phrase “OH GEEZ”, which tied together four long entries: OLIVE GARDEN, OLYMPIC GAMES, OPERAGLASSES, and ORANGE GROVE. Each one brought a smile, not just for the “O.G.” initials but for the variety and vivid imagery they evoked. Who doesn’t love a mental stroll through an orange grove or a nostalgic nod to unlimited breadsticks?\nClues were crisp and accessible, with just enough sparkle to keep things interesting. Highlights included:\n“Queen of the Nile, informally” for CLEO — a classic clue with a breezy twist.\n“Shake, as a dog’s tail” for WAG — simple, yet joyful.\nAnd “Silverstein who wrote ‘A Boy Named Sue’” for SHEL, which felt like a warm literary hug.\nThe grid was clean, the fill smooth, and the solving experience—start to finish—was like sipping a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. No obscure trivia, no awkward abbreviations, just a well-constructed puzzle that reminded me why I love Mondays in Crosswordland.\nIf this is the tone-setter for the week, I’m excited to see what Tuesday and beyond will bring. Here’s to a week of wordplay, wit, and that unbeatable “aha!” feeling.","createDate":"1747661890","updateDate":"1747715533","approveDate":"1747661891","recommendations":11,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142221944","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9626157283782959}

His name is a crossword regular, kind of like Alou, Asner, Alda. Huge kudos to Kiran for citing some of brother Shel’s best work. After some digging, I hadn't realized how influential he was, not only in writings and cartooning, but the hit songs he wrote. Wow. The things one learns by doing puzzles!\n\nQuick note to my fellow rap/hip-hop antis, André 3000’s Ms. Jackson was written to Erykah Badu. You may not want to listen to her “Tyrone”, but it's a cool groove, nonetheless. That being said, take in the likes of early neo soul’s Jill Scott, Lauren Hill or Roy Hargrove (RH Factor)... as smooth as some Sade’, you'll be amazed. The genre is still out there, but more for we jazz aficionado-types. Toss in some Tom Brown’s Jamaican Funk (unrelated), and go back for some Al Hirt.\n\nIf that doesn't do it for you, clear your head with ZZ Top’s 41D 😉","createDate":"1747662164","updateDate":"1747715496","approveDate":"1747662166","recommendations":4,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142222115","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9213881492614746}

I find pangrams more easily if my eyes are fresh and I don't get bogged down in the flurry of easier words that follow.  I never write anything on paper for the same reason: words are easier to see if the letters are just swimming around in your head.\n\nSo far, according to the Stats list, I have solved 660 puzzles, with 21,238 words, 809 pangrams and 656 Geniuses. The real geniuses rack up Queen Bees every day, and I have only 3 of those. I finally get too frustrated and bored to continue.\n\nMy real point is that finding a pangram is easier if you go for them first.  Genius will always follow.","createDate":"1747677424","updateDate":"1747680404","approveDate":"1747677425","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142219948,"parentUserDisplayName":"CCNY","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142232480","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6039290428161621}
