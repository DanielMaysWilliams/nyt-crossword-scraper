A palate cleanser, if you will, from my hate-finishing Sunday's puzzle this morning (ongoing frustrating technical issues marring what was also an adorable, lovely puzzle).\n\nAs someone who actively avoids revealers in early-week puzzles -- happily the highlight is almost always off-screen in my zoomed in mobile view -- it was such a pleasant surprise when I realized there IS no revealer! Thanks, Rajeswari!!\n\nI also have to thank Sam C. for providing a terrific phrase for a recurring reaction I have: \"gives us the linguistic 'ick'” to me perfectly suits the feeling when a clue and answer don't neatly align in one's brain. \n\nToday, that feeling happened for me with the Broadway clue -- as I commented down-thread -- and also with [On which croquet and cornhole are played]. I really loved the parallel of that clue with the subsequent one [On which Ping-Pong and air hockey are played], but it simultaneously reinforced the \"linguistic ick\" factor for me! In the latter clue, TABLE is the only platform on which those games are played. But 46D is less tight with \"cornhole\" in the clue. While cornhole can be played on a lawn, it doesn't require one -- unlike badminton! (IMHO a better example for the clue.)  ...The Strongbow brewery on the Red Hook waterfront here sets up cornhole boards on a narrow strip of gravel between their picnic tables and the sea!","createDate":"1731943779","updateDate":"1731971279","approveDate":"1731943784","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137694709","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-18","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8739226460456848}
