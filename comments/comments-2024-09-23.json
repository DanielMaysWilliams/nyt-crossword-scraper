While well more than half of his 17 NYT puzzles are Mondays and Tuesdays, he also has a pair of themeless puzzles filled with cluing deftness.  For example: here's one where he made a drab answer shine -- [Illustration, for example: Abbr.].*\n\nThe NE and SW corners of this grid are islands, that is, have only one answer coming in from outside.  Islands can be nerve-wracking on the tougher puzzle days of the week, but not today, because it’s Monday-time, and the cluin’ is easy.\n\nSome lovely serendipities today.  A pair of PuzzPairs©: YELP/YEOW and HIALL/HELLO.  Answers that become names when read backwards: TAP, AROD, AVE, and IRA.  And, I guess because my brain was really on the prowl, answers that are homonyms of other words: DEW, TEES, TIERS, NIT, TOE, and WERE.\n\nAnd, by the way, regarding this theme, try coming up with other in-the-language phrases ending in initialisms.  Then try to come up with pairs of them that contain equal numbers of letters.  There’s high skill behind this theme.\n\nBecause you have such range, Freddy, I never know when I’m going to see one of your puzzles next, but I’ve learned that it will be of superb quality.

Even if I’m not sure, I take a stab, because I find just seeing the letters in the grid helps me find the other answers. After one pass, I start doing the down clues, and it’s at that point that I see some of my first across guesses were wrong, and I move on from there.\nThis really helps with the late in the week puzzles, when it seems as if you don’t know anything!","createDate":"1727103965","updateDate":"1727110839","approveDate":"1727103968","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136385620,"parentUserDisplayName":"Josh","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136387329","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6399593949317932}

I do generally go left to right, top to bottom, and either across or down (i.e., one or the other) all the way, but I'll give the alternating approach a try. \n\nIt makes sense that mixing in a few (but not too many) crosses could add speed. And I should stress that I'm only talking about Mon, Tue, and maybe the occasional Weds--once it gets harder, I'm happy just to solve it at all.
