Just avoiding those two does not make a diet KOSHER.  There are many fish that are also not KOSHER, because they do not have both fins and scales.  Swordfish, catfish, shark and even some varieties of cod are not KOSHER.\n\nMany other meats are not KOSHER; pork is just the most common.  An animal must have cloven (divided) hooves and chew cud to be KOSHER.  Rabbits and all predatory and scavenger birds are not KOSHER.\n\nEven allowed meats are not KOSHER unless slaughtered in the prescribed way by a trained KOSHER slaughterer.  And even if so slaughtered, meats may not be served together with dairy products, or the meal becomes tref (a useful crossword word).\n\nNo food is considered KOSHER if served on plates that were used for non-KOSHER food, or with utensils that were used on non-KOSHER foods.\n\nWine has its own set of kashrut rules.\n\nAdditional rules apply for Passover.\n\nSo while the clue passes muster \"for crosswords\", it's very reductivist for the real world.

Per the info you provided, I was around 14 when listening to that song. At that age, I loved the Beatles and prog rock, the stuff playing on alt FM rock stations. Yoko was a bit much for me. But I listened to the song a few months ago and didn't hate it as much as I did as a 14-year old.\nHi Siddhartha Vicious,\nNot sure why it would be an \"important record.\" I doubt many people have ever heard the Yolo song, though folks my age have surely heard Cold Turkey. Have no idea where all those 45 rpm's ended up after I left home for college. My lil sis says they're in our cousin's basement. Maybe my next trip back to CT, I'll check out that basement.
