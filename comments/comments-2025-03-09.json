(Pondering punchlines, ideas welcome!)\n\nAnyhow, so I had a little more trouble down there but really it was a lot of the surrounding fill throughout the puzzle that I struggled with.

I'd call it a little over medium difficulty.\n\nAs to the references, most of them were of well-known people and occurrences. (NIXON RESIGNS and TITANIC SINKS--we've all seen those movies, right?) The ones that weren't well-known I could guess from the crosses (IDA McKinley, Joe TYNAN).\n\nMy rule of thumb for people I haven't heard of is, \"That's a name!\" Even though I didn't know of the Alan Alda film, I looked at the crosses and thought: \"TYNAN, that's a name! I'll put it in.\" Sometimes I'll leave a space blank: \"Is he SNEED or SNEAD? I'll leave that fourth space blank.\"\n\nThat said, there was little in the puzzle I was unfamiliar with (the crossing of Mr. SNEAD and SAL being my undoing). In order to be good at crossword puzzles, you need a head for trivia. It might be possible to avoid trivia in the Mini, but in a 21x21 Sunday grid it's impossible. I suggest reading, watching, and listening as widely as you can to up your crossword game. Get out of your comfort zone: if you love classical, listen to rap, or vice versa. Pick up a novel in a genre you don't like. If you've never played a video game, now's the time to start--they have improved just a little since the days of Pong.\n\nIn short: be curious.","createDate":"1741544608","updateDate":"1741566935","approveDate":"1741544609","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140425508,"parentUserDisplayName":"Alex","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140437911","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4828433692455292}

When somebody pompously declares they are proud to be Polish, I will often ask them why that is, exactly. The surprise on their faces is priceless. I usually don't get a good answer, either. Still, many Polish people did many good things over the centuries, and society as a whole rose up to many an occasion, like embracing the spirit of democracy in 1989, and then in 2023 after the autocratic crisis of 2015-2023.
