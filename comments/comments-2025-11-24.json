But Fate has a way of making those sorts pay: he had driven a loaner ATV up Mt. Etna, having heard that some nut had skied down it successfully. But the ATV started rolling back down the mountain, his head went CONK and then all was inky black.\n\nSeveral ERs later, when he finally swam to consciousness, it was as if his head was wrapped with silly string. \"I'm in hell,\" he thought, if hell was being unable to move, forever, inside a humid crate that kept him alive, as motionless as your average spud. The doctors were gobsmacked that he could even blink.\n\nFirst came the rages. Then the ennui. All he could see was sky through the hospital window. How he would long at night for a gyro fresh off the rotisserie from that deli on Lex, or, if he were feeling sensible, a veggie wrap and a prune juice. And then gad about town, drop names with the doorman at A. Mino's Bar, or drop in at the ongoing orgy at that private club downtown, where the password was \"Ask mom.\"  Where could he find the exit?\n\nAnyway, great puzzle -- and the sincerity and grace of the constructor's notes is truly moving.If there are any Minnesotans on the staff of the Times, might they play a version called LADY LADY GRAY LADY?","createDate":"1763956334","updateDate":"1764044850","approveDate":"1763956336","recommendations":32,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146842724","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6537958383560181}

I love retirement.\n\nBack to the puzzle....SILLYSTRING is a \"toy\" I never enjoyed cleaning up, but loved watching it happen. I have never heard a jack referred to as a KNAVE, and, in fact, only have heard the word used as a pejorative. (TIL I learned how to spell pejorative.) Well, it's not a perfect puzzle until I learn something!\n\nAs to the theme: I can remember sitting in kindergarten (we're talking in the 50s, people) sitting in a circle, playing the game, and not realizing that this is how Mrs. Clavell helped to break the ice for all of us first-timers (no nursery school or pre-K back then). We learned social skills and being a good loser. She learned who played well with others and who didn't communicate well. \n\nToday, they already know how to read and hide quietly in a closet.","createDate":"1763995945","updateDate":"1764048898","approveDate":"1763995946","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146847469","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9508289694786072}
