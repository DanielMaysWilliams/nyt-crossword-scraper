When you’ve been solving for several years like I have, Mon-Wed sometimes tend to solve themselves on autopilot, so this was an awesome surprise.

Actually, I got curious about what IRENAs may have been more well-known to the average solver, and was rather surprised there aren’t many. There’s Irena Sendler, a social worker who saved 2,500 Jewish children during the Holocaust by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then there are two rather minor literary characters, one from Turgenev and one from Milan Kundera. That’s it, though my “research” was limited to Wikipedia and ChatGPT. \n\n… Which of course made me wonder about the Tuesday clueing of the name of someone whom the constructor himself notes he’d never heard of, but that’s a nit for another day. Of course the crosses were kind and I always appreciate a TIL moment. \n\nHappy Monday or Tuesday, y’all, depending on your time zone.","createDate":"1736230582","updateDate":"1736305809","approveDate":"1736230585","recommendations":19,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138801402","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9436513185501099}

Like most things, you only get better at doing these by doing them (even when they're crunchier) and embracing the challenges and learning from them.  \n\nOne thing I love about puzzles in this crazy, unpredictable life is that they are all resolvable.  Unlike life, there is an answer to every clue and together, the entire puzzle. In my earlier days, I often couldn't see it without help and that's okay because the help helped me increase my skills.

It makes more sense today because with word processing so common now, we are more aware of bold typeface than when we were using typewriters.  \n\nThat also means it's ripe for supplanting (at least partially) a similar phrase that now makes less sense.  After all, what does \"bald-faced\" (or the original, \"barefaced\") mean anyway.  Clean-shaven?  Maskless?  It's ripe for being supplanted.\n\nAnd that's how language changes.  Something comes along that sounds better than what was there before.  Some pedants insist it has to be the old, \"correct\" way, but usage eventually wins out.  I believe that as the century progresses, bald-faced will continue to lose ground to bold-faced.\n\nAnyway, the puzzle is free to use anything that is common usage.  It doesn't have to be the most common expression, nor one that has 100% pedantic acceptance (cf.
