I cane in a little over average, which I guess jives with the very hard rating, though it didn't feel hard. That seems like a really good puzzle to me! \n\nAdmittedly, I did not notice asymmetry in the grid until the revealer. I'm trying to remember to look at the grid before I start, as recommended out here, but I guess I don't really get it yet...  if I had looked at it in advance, I *might* have noticed the asymmetry, but I'm really not that good with those sorts of spatial things. \n\nMight I have noticed the big A if the online puzzle didn't give me the yellow line as soon as I filled in the last letter? I'm kind of doubtful. So, while I really enjoyed doing the puzzle, I guess I don't fully appreciate the theme as much as I could, and as much as others clearly do. That's just me and my own lacking.\n\nThat said, I can appreciate what a feat it must have been to accomplish such a grid and with such great clues etc. I didn't really notice any junky stuff in it. \n\nI really loved the clue for NIECE, with thanks to Nancy J for reminding me of the I'm My own Grandpa song! I just made my husband listen to it, sent it to my niblings, and shared it to Facebook. 😂  \n\nI got to see my beloved NIECE this weekend, which was great, except she's going through her first big heartbreak. She's so nervous about going back to her senior year of college because he's going to be hard to avoid.

I think it is a big part of our culture and while I don’t drink I can’t deny that. I’ll be honest while it’s legal I don’t appreciate  a lot of marijuana references, or LSD, but I can’t argue with that either because they are legitimate words or topics. The only time I really took issue was when a clue referenced a quote (I think Steve Jobs) who seemed to suggest LSD was the main reason for his success, I thought that promoted it too much, and once I took issue with Deb who made a comment on an LSD clue in the column with “hope your trip is a good one” which I also felt promoted it. But just words related to it or alcohol are fair game, and I guarantee you ALE and IPA aren’t going anywhere for sure. Speaking of which I remember another weird crossword coincidence my nephew was visiting once who liked ESPRESSO MARTINIs which I had never heard of and that day it was in the crossword.","createDate":"1756216814","updateDate":"1756246952","approveDate":"1756216814","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144536272,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144540785","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.611294686794281}
