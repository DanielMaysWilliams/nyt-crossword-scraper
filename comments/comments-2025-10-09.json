I agree on the Thursday placement, while it doesn‚Äôt have the clever trick you might expect it‚Äôs too hard for a Wednesday‚Äîand it was hard for me, not in an unfair way, I had to jump around a bit. I was very intrigued by the theme as I was solving, I solved all the clues before the revealer and was thinking what could these have to do with each other? Once I got to the end I felt a little let down. I like how ‚Äútwo down‚Äù and ‚Äúone out‚Äù were sort of phrases in their own right‚Äî‚Äúone out‚Äù in baseball and ‚Äútwo down‚Äù (and one to go)‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt really follow with ‚Äútwo up‚Äù (maybe ahead two games?) and certainly not ‚Äútwo moving around each other‚Äù. Also I assume that is meant to be an image of ‚Äútwiddling one‚Äôs thumbs‚Äù but that‚Äôs not the image in my mind, I just think of moving thumbs separately‚Äîwhat do you all think?\nI thought most of the clues were fine although nothing much leapt out at me, my favorite was the HOLMES quote and DOHARM was a gimme. Finally, I won‚Äôt reiterate again here but NORI is flat out wrong, see my earlier comment in a response for my reasoning.\nOverall it solved like a themeless to me except for 3 long entries you had to work around and couldn‚Äôt guess.

But I have to tell you my thumb story.  I hope you'll stick with me, but I forgive you if you don't.\n\nIn math and physics, there is something called \"the Right Hand Rule\".  It involves something called the cross product of two vectors.  I know, I know, I said no math, but just bear with me.  \n\nIt involves the right hand.  You imagine using the fingers of your right hand to  mentally push one vector into another, and the direction of your answer is the way your thumb is pointing.  Again, just trust me.\n\nSo the Right Hand Rule is used to predict the direction of the cross product, and we can make that simple:  it's either up, or down, depending on which way the thumb of your right hand points. \n\nI had a physics problem which had the answer in the back of the book.  I got everything right about the problem except I had the direction wrong.  I thought it was \"down\", and the answer in the back of the book was \"up\".\n\nI struggled for hours with that problem, bashing the door frame in my mother's house with my right fist as I often did in the testosterone fueled days of academic competition.\n\nI finally realized my error.\n\nI was using my left hand, because my pencil was in my right hand.\n\nIf you've read this far, congratulations.","createDate":"1760009799","updateDate":"1760073611","approveDate":"1760009800","recommendations":26,"replyCount":16,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145828351","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6018899083137512}

You want a couple pink streaks in your hair, do it! People express themselves in different ways and, well that's not exactly me,  I'm glad that things are looser now. \n\nI know that's not exactly what you're saying, but it seems related. People can say what they will about the younger generations, but I think in so many ways they are doing great! And I am here for it!! I truly hope my niece gets some highlights in her hair but her parents, you know my brother and sister-in-law, along with the rest of my family are very conservative and so I'm not sure.
