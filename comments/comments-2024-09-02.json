One of the other trombonists in that ensemble was a guy named George Masso, who had played with Jimmy Dorsey’s band. Seems that Masso found the life as a professional jazz musician to be financially challenging, so he gave it up for a time to become a high school music teacher/band director. Happens that when I was in Junior High in Storrs, CT he realized that there were no up coming trombone players for the HS band so he approached me and asked if I would be willing to try that instrument. He gave me private lessons for free for about a year and I went on to play all 4 HS years in band, orchestra, pep band, jazz band….good memories of that fellow.
