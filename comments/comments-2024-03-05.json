I tried so hard to figure out the revealer before uncovering it.  Tried every angle to see what the theme answers had in common, looked at first words, last words, hidden inner words, first and last letters, possible synonyms.  Nothing.  Nothing came.\n\nSo, I uncovered the revealer, saw its meaning -- so simple and perfect -- and with a “Dang!” and a “D’oh!”, I just shook my head and wondered, “Why the heck didn’t I crack this?”\n\nThat is the sign of the finest riddles, the ones that best you fair and square, that flummox you with something right in front of your face that you don’t see.  Oh, I loved this.  Great one, Christina. Props and high respect.  \n\nAnd amazing props for coming up with this theme in the first place, hearing “three-hole punch” and morphing it into this!\n\nOften when I uncover the reaveler, it results in an “I see”, or an “Ah, there’s some cleverness there,” but this one hit me with a wow and a pow, a combo of humor, wit, and surprise.  A great, great crossword moment.
