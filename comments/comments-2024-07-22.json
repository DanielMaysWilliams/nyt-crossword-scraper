I truly like this era of the Times puzzles, all these clever tricks and puns. Spritely cluing in this one, and some unusual fill. Mooch...hah, wasn't that what they called Trump's shortlived Chief of Staff? God save us!\n\nI see SPLAT is making a big comeback, and each time it's clued I first think it must be THUNK. I have never heard a sound that sounded like SPLAT. No water balloon, paint ball, fat man cannonball, mosquito swatting, stamping on a Macdonalds ketchup packet, big gob of spit against a car window, ever sounded like SPLAT. Splat is to the sound of a toddler hurling his oatmeal to the floor as instant coffee is to real coffee. Yet I love the word SPLAT for trying as hard as a word can to approximate that sound. Splat, you're living your best life. Congratulations on appearing twice this week, dude, you thunk my world. \n\nAnd oh, the humanity, here I am 4 hours after this column shoulda been up - somebody asleep at the wheel probably keyed it in to appear at the \"usual\" time -- 10pm -- forgetting it's supposed to be 6 pm. And I like that, that this place hasn't become so AI-driven and homogenized that accidents like this never happen. I like the feckless bumptiousness of the whole affair, that it's a community of real people, who sometimes make little mistakes, or (in other news) big ones like those Crowdstrike bozos.

And I wasn't 22 anymore, either.  Having never  even tried on a pair of low-rise pants, much less ever owned any, I was in a ritzy Madison Avenue UES shop and chanced upon a pair of the most gloriously soft chocolate brown cashmere pants.  They were beautifully cut: shaped in a way that made me look taller -- no mean feat.  And they were on sale.\n\nChocolate brown cashmere pants are quite rare.  Ones on sale are rarer still. \n\nI didn't feel completely secure walking in them, but there wasn't all that much walking to be done in the shop.  And the elastic seemed firm...\n\nI never sat down in them.  There was no place to sit in the shop and no reason to sit.\n\nDear Reader, I took them home.\n\nI had them on at home (thank heavens!) when I made the mistake of sitting down in them for the first time.  And when I got up...!!!!\n\nDear Reader, I have never worn them.  No eyes have ever seen me in them.  The most ridiculous excuse for \"clothing\" it has ever been my misfortune to own.","createDate":"1721658700","updateDate":"1721705335","approveDate":"1721658704","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134862036,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy J.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134865729","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.47307220101356506}
