So kind of a compromise between the pro-gimmick and anti-gimmick camps.\n\nThe hemoglobin comment reminded me of playing VR recent with one of my sons, when for some reason he said “hemogoblin,” which I thought was hilarious.\n\nIt’s really hard coming up with good constructor’s notes—harder at times than constructing the puzzles themselves. This time I thought it would be both helpful and funny to go in this different direction. Honestly, I thought there would be some umbrage but everyone has been really supportive, which I appreciate!\n\nAnd finally, the Night Beast can’t be reasoned with, it can’t be bargained with . . . it doesn’t feel pity of remorse or fear . . . and it absolutely will not stop.

We needed a strong pump to ensure the pigments were fully deoxygenated; getting to very low PO2s allowed us to chart the sigmoid shape of the Hb binding curve and to demonstrate the Bohr shift and Root effect. It was a fun lab to do. \n\nThere is a great deal of oxygen held by blood pigments; I am surprised you could achieve full deoxygenation by placing the blood in nitrogen. The oxygen released from the blood would raise the PO2  in the N-tent environment. Did you have to replenish the nitrogen frequently?\n\nWe compared O2 binding curves for hemoglobin and hemocyanin, which was collected from whelks. You probably know that oxygenated Hc is a lovely shade of blue, not red. You may not know that when it is fully deoxygenated it turns... clear. \n\nWhen the blood was placed in the tonometers, the vacuum pump turned on, and the pressure in the chamber dropped, the O2 would boil off. A huge amount of O2 was held by both pigments. It was a real eye-opener for the students. For me, too, every time I saw it.\n\nAs you say, the deoxygenated Hb is still red, but a much duller red than when fully oxygenated.\n\nThe tonometer we used was modified from the one described in this link. We added a cuvette so we could tip the blood into the cuvette and stick it into a spectrophotometer while still evacuated.\n\n<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14794725\" target=\"_blank\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14794725</a>/","createDate":"1753028488","updateDate":"1753074010","approveDate":"1753028490","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143662655,"parentUserDisplayName":"SP","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143669495","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6769146919250488}

I revealed the puzzle and looked at my problem spots (that is, 80% of the grid 😂). There was no chance in hell I would ever complete this. Of course the constructor did not know this but he created the perfect anti-Andrzej puzzle. Not only did I know almost none of the names and trivia, but also the slangy expressions and niche terms were beyond my language skills: I may be very good at English, but please remember I know it totally differently than you do. And there was also the wavelength thing: the constructor apparently thinks completely differently than me. All these factors combined to make the puzzle totally unsolvable for me. It might as well have been in Klingon.\n\nEric, as you may remember, getting a gold star is not high on the list if my priorities, and I don't care at all about any sort of streak.

This was just wasn't one of those. Consider this:\n\nIn order to compete a puzzle you have to:\n1. Understand the clues, as (a) sentences in English, and as  (b) riddles, of sorts\n2. Know the answers, as words, names or phrases\n\nAd 1. Understanding for you is not the same as it is for me. You're a native speaker. 1(a) above is probably very rarely an issue for you. Thus, you only have to deal with 1(b) as a proper challenge. Now imagine you don't have an intimate understanding of a multifaceted language and you're faced with a riddle in it. For me, both 1(a) and 1(b) are issues. If I'm not on the constructor's wavelength, and I don't understand some of the language, I'm ephphed.\n\nAd 2. Again, this is about linguistic and cultural immersion. For you it mostly comes naturally. I probably know English half as good as you, and my American cultural immersion is what? 5% of yours? Tops!\n\nSo naturally, some puzzles will simply be impossible for me, if the above problems accumulate. This puzzle was like a super hard, Sunday-sized Saturday for me.
