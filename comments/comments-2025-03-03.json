Manny Nosowsky, a personal favorite of mine along with Byron Walden, said one puzzle took him 100 hours to complete. The thrill was always to be taken to the edge of hopelessness and somehow to be brought back to finish. \n\nIf you want to study the magical properties of intuition, to experience yourself solving with a mysterious capacity that goes beyond the everyday brain, to come to solutions \"out of the blue,\" crosswords are your obvious choice.\n\nCarry on, everyone!!!","createDate":"1740959536","updateDate":"1741068626","approveDate":"1740959538","recommendations":50,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140242828","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6624199151992798}

For one thing I'm not very adroit. As we drove around the oval, I forgot to keep in mind the rule about not having anything in your hands while driving. I was holding an icee in my left hand and trying to complete an etrade with my other. The instructor sat in the rear, praying to God and clutching his rosaries. Suddenly a dog ran across the road in front of me. \"Don't ram Lassie!\" he shouted.  \n\nBut as I said, it was tragic. There was a piece of the pug here, an eye lens there, and all sorts of stuff, like a gel mixed with what looked like acai berries. \"At least he is at ease now,\" I told the instructor, turning on the several radios for the stereo effect. First there was an ad for Etna Insurance, then one for ROTC, then an episode of Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason, like we were back in another era. Despite this, the instructor was in low spirits.\n\nDid I mention they're going to evict me from the country? I'm taking an airplane to Geneva, I just hope their ATM has a Euro or two for me.

Most publications have removed the ability to comment at all, so though we chafe at what we see as arbitrary removals, it is their right to moderate the forum.\nIMHO, we usually get a lot of leeway.

Or bots doing the work. 🤷‍♀️ But I don’t know…","createDate":"1741020993","updateDate":"1741060433","approveDate":"1741020994","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140256049,"parentUserDisplayName":"JohnWM","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140260215","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7270373106002808}
