When I observed the 2017 eclipse from Stanley, Idaho, we had clear skies.  There were cows in the distance and lots of dogs immediately around. I didn’t see any of the cows react but the dogs’ reactions were all over the place, from nothing noticeable, to shaking and vomiting but very quickly recovering.  At an elevation of 6290 ft, the temperature plunge was dramatic. My first total solar eclipse was in February 1979 and my father and I saw it from a plane chartered for the purpose. It was the only way that we had much of a chance of clear skies. I remember the shadow speeding across the tops of the clouds.  Breathtaking!  Each one is a fond memory.  \n\nFeel better, Deb.

To point out some of the simplest from today's offering:\n\n[Allowed] for LICIT\n[Triumph] for WIN\n[Sharpness] for TANG\n\nSome clues are examples or more complete definitions, maintaining parallelism in part of speech and specific form:\n\n[Move like a crab] for SIDLE\n[The sun emerging from the clouds at exactly the right time, say] for OMEN\n\nBut clues like the one for 60D are different. The answer tells what \"there\" (or more usually, \"it\") is in the clue, often with some misdirection:\n\n[Stay there!] clues INN because an INN is where you can stay.  In addition, \"Stay there!\" is usually used to mean \"Don't come any closer\" or \"Stay where you are, I'm coming to you.\"\n\nA previous clue with \"there!\" was 3/14/20, when [Refuse to go there!] clued DUMP, and on 11/17/18, [Hang in there!] clued CLOSET.  \n\nTo make things more confusing, often such clues are of the standard type, such as (7/1/23) [\"You there!\"] clues HEY, and (3/28/20) [\"Well, looky there!\"] clues OHO.  How can you tell the difference?  Note that these equivalency clues have quotation marks to indicate similar things one could say aloud, whereas the misdirects have no quotes.\n\nThe more common word used in such clues is \"it\" instead of \"there\".

The scrolling system was invented by the Marquis of Sade.  It's like finding a needle in a haystack.  Here are some of the things I contend with.  YMMV.\n\n1) If there are more than 100 comments, the F function no longer works.  Sometimes if you scroll down far enough it starts to work again, but how far is enough...?\n\n2) You can only scroll using the name of the commenter on the F function.  If I type in \"Puzzle of the Year\" nothing at all will happen.\n\n3) My own particular problem:  There's another Nancy (J) on the blog who usually posts above me so that her comment will come up and not mine.  At least 50% of the time if I've waited longer than 2-3 hours to check a post of mine, I WILL NEVER SET EYES ON MY OWN COMMENT AGAIN.\n\nI give finding John Ezra's next solicitation for POY nominations about a 15% chance of my ever seeing it.

To point out some of the simplest from today's offering:\n\n[Allowed] for LICIT\n[Triumph] for WIN\n[Sharpness] for TANG\n\nSome clues are examples or more complete definitions, maintaining parallelism in part of speech and specific form:\n\n[Move like a crab] for SIDLE\n[The sun emerging from the clouds at exactly the right time, say] for OMEN\n\nBut clues like the one for 60D are different. The answer tells what \"there\" (or more usually, \"it\") is in the clue, often with some misdirection:\n\n[Stay there!] clues INN because an INN is where you can stay.  In addition, \"Stay there!\" is usually used to mean \"Don't come any closer\" or \"Stay where you are, I'm coming to you.\"\n\nA previous clue with \"there!\" was 3/14/20, when [Refuse to go there!] clued DUMP, and on 11/17/18, [Hang in there!] clued CLOSET.  \n\nTo make things more confusing, often such clues are of the standard type, such as (7/1/23) [\"You there!\"] clues HEY, and (3/28/20) [\"Well, looky there!\"] clues OHO.  How can you tell the difference?  Note that these equivalency clues have quotation marks to indicate similar things one could say aloud, whereas the misdirects have no quotes.\n\nThe more common word used in such clues is \"it\" instead of \"there\".
