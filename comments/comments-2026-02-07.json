Despite the many decades of puzzles I’ve worked on I still get flustered when I see a lot of open white space and long answer stacks in the grid, even though experience has taught me that all it takes is enough crosses or good guesses to get one or two of the long entries and then there is enough information to make the puzzle unfold like a rose.  Sure enough, I got RETIRETHESIDE and TOENAILSCISSORS and was able to build the puzzle from the bottom up — until I got to the top third that is.    Up top, I had screwed myself royally by filling in COFFEECAKES (based on the K from KAEL) for 1A.  My ignorance of all things car-related also led to my entering El Dorado, instead of ELCAMINO (Chevy,  Cadillac what’s the diff, they both begin with C).  Apologies to our resident car buff Grant for this bit of automotive ignorance.  Having sorted that out I tried coffee maker before finally stumbling on WAFFLEMAKER and was able to cruise to a reasonable Saturday finish.\n\nFavorite entry: GOODSPELLERS\n\nI got DAB by recalling old Brylcreem ads, “A little dab’ll do ya.”","createDate":"1770436147","updateDate":"1770539064","approveDate":"1770436149","recommendations":66,"replyCount":13,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148707781","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.826357364654541}

That is, did you feel like you ran into many answers you’ve never seen before?  \n\nWell it is.  Amazingly is.  This puzzle has eight answers of 11 letters or more, and every one is a NYT answer debut.  That includes all six answers of the top and bottom stacks and those two long downs at 7D and 19D.  Wow!\n\nThere are actually 11 debuts.  Not all have zing, but, IMO, many do, such as MACARONI SALAD, ROPE INTO, WAFFLE MAKER, and GOOD SPELLERS.\n\nNew answers and their clues remove the easy gets that come from having seen them before in puzzles.  They happify the brain by giving it new territory to conquer.\n\nMark has been making Times puzzles for 42 years, and it’s clear he’s sharp as ever, crafting this uber-low 62-worder with plenty of GRIT and yes, pulsing with freshness.\n\nBTW, I love those photo-album corners! \n\nMark, I found your puzzle satisfying and richly punctuated with pleasurable moments.

Polish. You would of course appreciate the general tragicomism of it, but the scathing look at Poland and its people would probably largely be lost on you. The protagonist (anti-hero?) is frustrated not only by his personal failures, but also by the country he lives in. The sad fate of the intelgencja* (intelligentsia, to you) after the 1989 transformation is at the core of the film. It's all painfully poignant to an intelligent and disillusioned Polish viewer. An intelligent and disillusioned American might feel lost in places. So don't go out of your way looking for it. It would be best if we could watch it together. I'd rather you didn't hold my hand though. Or other bits. \n\n*\"Inteligencja\" was a social class in the Eastern bloc - it consisted of teachers, scholars, writers, and the like. They were the elite of society. Back then nobody was wealthy so elite status was not bought or dictated  by money - it was earned by acquiring the quite rare higher education, and living an educated life. Under market economy the status of inteligencja declined, eventually leading to the disappearance of it as a social class. Those were the circumstances in which Adaś Miauczyński, the protagonist, found hhimself. And it hurt.","createDate":"1770497658","updateDate":"1770518921","approveDate":"1770497659","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148722217,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148722475","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-07","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.474768728017807}

For that reason, the PD became important to me. For a few years n the late 90s and into the 2000s I freelanced for it largely because it was the Post, as the money was meager...but now it is vanishing...when Lee Enterprises bought it roughly  20 years ago, they turned it into essentially a small-town paper and who knows how much longer it will be around.
