They were country boys from Greene County, PA, filled with mischief and mayhem. A day spent in their company might involve digging for arrowheads, swimming in a rain-filled abandoned quarry, crash-sailing down a steep hillock in Chris's homemade hang-glider, smoking jimson weed (headache, intestinal issues) in the ruins of an early 19th century stone blast furnace on Roberts Run a little north of Spraggs, trying to get attacked by a gang of peahens and peacocks this old couple in Carmichaels raised. But one time they came back from a weekend at home and bragged about going cow tipping all night. It was the first I heard the term. \n\nThey said most livestock sleeps standing up in the fields and you could sneak up and give 'em a push, they'd teeter and totter and then crash, still asleep, to the ground. They said it was like causing the demolition of a large building, the thunderous noice of it, the brutes startled awake, bruised and enraged, snorting and lowing, struggling to get up; and the danger to the cow-tipper was heady and addictive: they were enormous, blind with rage, they could give chase, as could the farmers. \n\nTo me it was utter moral depravity, demonstrating a lack of basic empathy. Our friendship cooled, ended. \n\nNow I read on wiki that cow-tipping is impossible, it's the rural equivalent of an urban legend. Takes at least 14 cow-tippers! And they don't always sleep standing.

All of them make me wonder, “How can this answer not have appeared in a Times puzzle before?”  \n\nFreshness abounding, then, in this puzzle, especially in that center stairstep stack, containing four debuts and one answer that has appeared but once before in the Times.  Wow!\n\nFreshness like this, to me, is not a constructor showing off.  It’s a constructor exhibiting skill, as good debut answers are not easy to come by.  It’s a constructor focused on entertaining the solver through answers and clues never seen before in the NYT puzzle.\n\nThe solving enjoyment, for me, was padded by sweet wordplay misdirects, such as [Meeting places] for FORA and [Run slowly] for SEEP.\n\nSpark, shine, and play, on top of satisfying my brain’s workout ethic.

My first guess for 25A was LOWTIPPER. I imagined that “bulldozing” must be waitpersons’ slang for being dissed by customers, an expression that would have started in Soho or Williamsburg and gone viral. Wikipedia says that cowtipping is a so-called “urban legend” – which in this case could be a city person’s idea of how some folks in the hinterland amuse themselves. So the center of the grid isn’t all noir, but includes \nsome timely red and blue.\n\nFor me, the really tough parts of this puzzle were the NE and SW quadrants.

I slowly worked through the middle, but the northeast and southwest were killer for me and because I really had to shove off soon, I broke and did one look up in each, for FRANZEN and RILEY.
