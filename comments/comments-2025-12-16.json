First of all, anyone who was complaining of yesterday being chewy for a Monday is really not going to be happy today. Frankly I was feeling like I was doing an end of week puzzle with the top middle and right—PROGROCK just isn’t in my vocabulary, or BRAH though I’ve seen it once or twice, I had SATINS instead of SHEENS; and for some reason PAVES and GEEKY just didn’t come to my mind initially. And appreciate the hint on NEYO  but I was going for NEEO or NEOO and the theme entry wasn’t coming to me for a cross. (I’m not opposed to rappers but I’m never going to get them without crosses). A lot of other crunchy entrees elsewhere like ASCII and UMHI and RAISINET and AKIRA crossing…\n\nThen there’s the theme, which really has me on the fence. I love the idea and the theme entries were very clever. But somehow the revealer just wasn’t clear to me. Probably just me, but I kept thinking the ENDS were involved some other way. Or we were splitting the book, or maybe the B and K of the book were involved (especially with BAG CHECK). I haven’t felt so dense about a theme in a long time.\n\nFinally it all clicked. And it really was a very clever theme. And I do like a challenge, Tuesday or not. It just felt very forced, for reasons I can’t quite put my finger on .  Curious to see if others felt this way, or this was just one of those days my brain was just on a completely different wavelength than the constructor.

Deep in my memory, without clarity, is.. . beware the IBM byte-swap.\n\nApparently some businesses still use EBCDIC rather than ASCII … a business in Belgium not long ago lost a European court case because their EBCDIC system couldn’t handle the diacritical in the customer’s name, according to Wikipedia.\n\nBut our crossword could be all in EBCDIC … which if I remember right has only capital English/Latin letters.  I wonder if crosswords in other languages have accents and umlauts too.  Not to mention lower case letters.\n\nWhen I lived in continental Europe my given names were supposed to be capitalized and my family name was supposed to be in all capitals.  My name looked to them like two given names, so they needed the all caps one for guidance.\n\nThese days the descendant of EBCDIC and ASCII seems to be UTF-8.  Has lots of characters with diacriticals.  Maybe even has the reduced Planck constant hbar… hbar doesn’t seem to have transitioned into crosswords.  Unlike TBAR.","createDate":"1765885023","updateDate":"1765898970","approveDate":"1765885026","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147334518,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ms. Billie M.

The question is certainly GOOGLEABLE:  \n\n\"Raisinets are a specific brand name primarily sold in the United States, but chocolate-covered raisins (as a general product) are widely available under various regional brands in many countries. The Raisinets brand itself is currently owned by Ferrero, which acquired the US candy business from Nestlé in 2018. \n\nWhile the Raisinets brand is very US-centric, here are some examples of chocolate-covered raisins in other countries:\n\nUnited Kingdom: They are a classic confectionery item found in most supermarkets under store branding or specific brands like Paynes Poppets.\n\nCanada: The popular brand is Glosette Raisins, originally by the Lowney Company and now owned by Hershey Canada.\n\nAustralia: The product is commonly referred to as \"chocolate-covered sultanas\" and sold by various local confectioners or as store-brand versions.\n\nPeru: A popular brand is named Fochis, made by Compañía Nacional de Chocolates de Perú S.A.. \n\nSo while you may not find the exact yellow box of \"Raisinets\" outside of the US, you will almost certainly find a local equivalent. \"\n\nGrowing up here there was a fierce rivalry between the raisin based candy and a sister brand, Goobers, which were/are choclate covered peanuts.  Both are/were movie theater staples.","createDate":"1765893829","updateDate":"1765920865","approveDate":"1765893830","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147337302,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ιασων","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147338437","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.751143753528595}
