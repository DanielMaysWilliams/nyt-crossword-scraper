Learned a new word, 3D. It kept me all twisted up for while.  A regional lacking on my part. I'm from the south and have never heard that word before. With my crosses it spelled out exactly what it was. imagine my surprise when it was correct. The rest of the puzzle was charming. \n\nAlthough, and this is just nitpicking on my part. Dropping an anchor isn't really 20Aing it. All part of that worrisome NW corner.  To secure that boat, one might want to do both, drop anchor and 20A.  If you are dropping the anchor, you're just dropping the anchor. To 20A it, you have to attach the boat to something. Like wrapping the line around a dock post on a pier.  It can even be a buoy if you're away from the dock. Point being, these are two distinctive and separate actions. You can anchor a boat to something without dropping the anchor I suppose. But the clue was specific. Like I said nitpicking. 🤓 LOL. \n\nHopefully all our SE coastal folks have anchored all their boats securely and are drying off tonight.
