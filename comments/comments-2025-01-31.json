That's slightly more than nine years.  It's been a long time, but unless something happened I never heard about, David Connell is still ahead of me by about two months.\n\nTo everybody struggling to put a weeklong streak together, remember that I was there at one point (although no one was keeping track of streaks then), but with enough experience, you can get to the \"when, not if\" (I solve the puzzle) stage of puzzle solving.\n\nAt that point, you just have to make sure you don't forget to do the puzzle.  Since I'm not inclined to be watching TV at 10 pm, I can usually do the puzzle as soon as it hits.  But even when I can't, I still do it before going to bed.  Even if that's at 2 a.m.  (I find it helps relax me, as the main reason for not being able to do it earlier usually is that I was driving.)\n\nIt was weird when we were in Europe, because I had to switch to solving upon waking up.

Most students study for free here - the right to free education including university level is enshrined in the Constitution. However, the best universities are located in big cities where the cost of living is high, so most students simply need to work to afford accomodation and food. The schools offer student housing at cost, but the number of spots is limited, and most students rent rooms on the market. Fee rent whole apartments as that is simply too expensive.","createDate":"1738303319","updateDate":"1738373098","approveDate":"1738303320","recommendations":19,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139391333","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4974387586116791}

A terrific misdirecting clue – [It’s followed by an extra point] for ALSO – an answer that has appeared hundreds of times In Crosslandia, but never clued like this.  Also, the spark from freshness – there are four stacks, totaling 12 answers, and 11 of them have appeared in the Times puzzle but four times or less.  Wow! My two favorite answers are debuts: A BET IS A BET and EMPTY STARE.\n\nAnd afterward, a scan showing hardly a whiff of junk in this low-word-count puzzle (68), evidence of Adrian’s skill and persistence.\n\nJoy, respect, and a host of goodies all rolled into one box.
