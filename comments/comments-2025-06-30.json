I didn't understand how the revealer was supposed to work, though. I needed the column to explain that to me 🤣\n\nThe themed entries were easy to get. I stumbled on the last one for a minute. I thought all the names would be female, and I momentarily forgot She-ra was a Princess of Power. I wanted NO WAY JANE there 😃. aH YES worked. nHERA looked very weird though, so I gave the entries there another look and suddenly remembered both the expression NO WAY JOSE and the name SHE-RA. D'oh!\n\nBtw, is it me or is the satisfied sound randomly (arbitrarily?) spelled either AHH or AaH?\n\nSpeaking of SHE-RA, in a way: He-man was one of the few Western shows on Polish TV in the 1980s. I was 7-ish at the time but already spoke basic English. I was so puzzled by that name: why the double indication of masculinity? Isn't that a bit weird? The realization may have been a prelude to my deep dislike for overblown, toxic masculinity in my middle age.\n\nAs for my favorite movie lines, they are all from \"Seksmisja\" by Juliusz Machulski and \"Miś\" by Stanisław Bareja (Polish comedies from the 1980s), so quoting them here would be no use.","createDate":"1751258582","updateDate":"1751340465","approveDate":"1751258583","recommendations":17,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143189161","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-30","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7696882486343384}
