The sign of a well (perhaps devilishly so) clued puzzle is that the clues seem opaque, but the answer (when eventually found) elicits an “of course, how could I not have seen that” response.  This puzzle had many such clues, and I came close to putting it down and heading to bed at several points, but sheer stubbornness kept me at it until it grudgingly relented. The only thing that saved me was my love of music.  I am an aficionado of guitar music of all sorts, and the CLASSICALGUITAR of Andres Segovia was the first long answer to come to me.\n\nAnd one of the very few gimmes I had on a first pass was Billy BRAGG, although I would quibble with the characterization folk singer. To me, he’s a singer/songwriter with a punk ethos and a political bent.  He doesn’t dabble too much in traditional material.  I’ve seen him in a very small venue and he’s thoughtful and articulate about social justice and political issues in speech as well as song.  His album Workers Playtime is a perennial favorite of mine, especially the song Waiting For The Great Leap Forwards, which takes the Maoist slogan and applies it wryly to the struggles of the musician striving to mix pop and politics: “Join the struggle while you may, the revolution is just a tee shirt away.”  He writes fine, sophisticated love songs too, e.g. The Only One.","createDate":"1730516978","updateDate":"1730633807","approveDate":"1730516980","recommendations":42,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137294204","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4333013594150543}

Well done, Blake!\n\nDon't ask me how, but I finished it with no cheats.  Steely determination was the reason.  I have had a rather dismal week on the whole -- perhaps the worst week I have had since I began blogging about the puzzle (who can remember anything before that?) -- and I was determined to put up a good fight.  And, because of the refreshing lack of proper names, this would have been a hard puzzle to cheat on in any case.  All the difficulty was in the cluing: CLASSROOM ROSTER  (last answer in); ROTATE CLOCKWISE (lovely!).\n\nI was pretty sure that gOAT was not a Thanksgiving dish, but until I had filled in ?RAGG, I would never have come up with BOAT.  (GRAGG didn't look right.)  I guess a BOAT is made with turkey?  With sweet potatoes?  With cranberry sauce?  Whatever it is, I got it.\n\nHard as the puzzle was, there were a few answers I got immediately.  LOSE-LOSE.  REDS (I was watching baseball back when they called themselves the Redlegs).  MITTS (I saw the wordplay immediately).  IVES.  MAR.  SUSS.  LEGGS.  TOATEE.  Some sort of LEADERS and some sort of SPATULAS.  EVERMORE.\n\nThis was a \"keep the faith\" puzzle for me -- and it lasted longer than any sermon, that much I can tell you.
