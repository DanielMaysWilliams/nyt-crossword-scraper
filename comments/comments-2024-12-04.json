Soon thereafter, his brother, William, started Lafayette Coney Island, in the space next door. The establishments, and the rivalry, exist today.\n\nThe exact recipes for that weird chili stuff are, of course, heavily guarded trade secrets, but one ingredient is said to be finely ground beef hearts.\n\nThe restaurants are a convenient walk from our apartment: my Partner prefers Lafayette, although he usually orders a \"loose\"--seasoned, but unsauced, ground beef on the bun, then topped with the chili, mustard, and onions.

The word \"rabbit\" arose in the 14th century to mean the young of the species, but by the 19th century had replaced CONEY as the everyday word for the species in general.  This change took place because the word was originally pronounced to rhyme with \"honey\" and \"money\".\n\nCONEY Island was named by the Dutch (their cognate was \"conijn\") for the abundance of rabbits found there; apparently, the word didn't sound like a dirty word to them, so it still lives on today, both in everyday Dutch and in the Anglicized version of the island's name.  (And technically, it's now a peninsula, having been connected to mainland Brooklyn with landfill.)\n\nMeanwhile, back in English, the word CONEY was no longer the everyday word for \"rabbit\", but it was in the King James Bible, so something had to be done.  The solution was to start to pronounce it to rhyme with \"bony\" and \"stony\".

It's a regional (Midwestern) coinage.  In New York, we call them hot dogs, and you're going to get the same product in CONEY Island as at a street cart in Midtown or a deli in Queens.\n\nThe clue is a little off here, in my opinion.  A CONEY dog (i.e. the product sold in Detroit under that name) is not a Brooklyn food specialty.  CONEY Island is in Brooklyn, of course, and it is famous for hot dogs (after all, the most famous purveyor of franks is called Nathan's Famous), but...\n\nThe typical hot dog in Coney Island is served with some combination of mustard, sauerkraut and sauteed onions, with ketchup available for the delusional.  Other condiments are available, and you could make it a quintessential Detroit hot dog by ordering a chili dog, and adding mustard and raw onions, and maybe cheese (all the ingredients are there), but it would be rather unusual in that setting.  It would not be the typical New York hot dog.\n\nIn fact, it wouldn't surprise me that the availability of some of those ingredients at Nathan's were a latter-day addition after the time that the Greeks who eventually settled in Detroit passed through New York.\n\nAnd New Yorkers don't call them CONEY dogs.","createDate":"1733316267","updateDate":"1733352940","approveDate":"1733316271","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138040398,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jenny H","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138043111","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8045992851257324}

At just over a year, so am I. What I've learned though is that if I don't understand how the clues work, especially on a themed puzzle day, I just ignore them completely until I have enough crosses to try to get an idea. \n\nToday, the first one I figured out was the period clue because I had enough downs that I could make out that it likely included the words OF TIME. I had the S and T of STRETCH and made a stretch, if you will, to guess it was STRETCHOFTIME, and when I looked back at the clue and thought of other things that a period could mean, it all made sense. Thus, the other answers came more quickly when I thought of other meanings of the punctuation words against my crosses. \n\nIn short, don't fret if you don't get it right away, just keep at it with what you can fill out and trust that it will start to make sense.\n\nHope this helps!","createDate":"1733340682","updateDate":"1733376045","approveDate":"1733340686","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138051450,"parentUserDisplayName":"Randy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138053911","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7733452916145325}
