So, for anyone who cares, you can tell what kind of streak it is.\n\nI actually have a long list, but it boils down to this. When solving on paper in the aughts, I would use any reference book to help. This included Wikipedia. It included most anything short of the answer key.\n\nWhen I began solving online in 2014, I discovered that as long as I didn't do \"check puzzle,\" if I had an error somewhere, the software would alert me but not tell me where. If I found it on my own, even by trial and error, it would give me the star. So I reformed my rules around that as a guideline. This meant not doing anything that was akin to revealing the answer, such as using search terms that would bring up the clue and answer. Other kinds of research, I still allowed myself. \n\nAs I've become more acquainted with typical crossword fills and misdirects, I've used fewer kinds of help. This streak began about 6 years into my online solving experience and I honestly can't remember how much help I was using at that time. I can say that by now, maybe once a month I can't find a mistake and resort to verifying the spellings of my answers. If I use any word or part of a word from the clue in my search term, I consider that an asterisk in my solve. This streak includes probably four or so asterisks.","createDate":"1756661730","updateDate":"1756694997","approveDate":"1756661730","recommendations":15,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144669045","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8232018351554871}

Spaight\n\nThe whole Bond thing blossomed just as I was fighting my way through puberty.  I saw Thunderball probably when I was 13 or 14, young enough to think \"Do people really act like that when they're naked?\"\n\nI hated Bond.  I hate the movies.  I've been told to try this one or that one and I do, and I am literally shedding tears of boredom before I'm even half-way through.\n\nHaving seen Sean Connery's Bond when I was just beginning to notice the opposite sex, he was the ultimate competitor.  As such, there was no way I could like him, or even not despise him.  So I approach Bond in every film as if he were built from the worst aspects of Satan, Pluto, and John Voight.\n\nI wonder how it affected young people differently depending on their gender and budding sexual preferences.  Obviously many girls my age saw Sean Connery (or any Bond) in a very different light.  \n\nBut I don't recall being attracted to the glamorous sex symbols of the era designed to appeal to me:  Marilyn Monroe, Tina Louise's Ginger on Gilligan's Island, anyone reeking of pretense.  And Bond was nothing if not pretentious. \n\nSo maybe the girls I felt I was competing with Bond over didn't like him as much as I assumed they did.","createDate":"1756625204","updateDate":"1756658306","approveDate":"1756625204","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144661912,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ms. Billie M.
