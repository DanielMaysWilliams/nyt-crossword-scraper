I knew the Phillies mascot (the PHANATIC), but I suspect that will pose some unfair problems for non sports fans and non US puzzlers, especially with the idiosyncratic spelling making it a little harder to intuit. I was also familiar with LOTTA Sea Lice, because Kurt Vile is a local artist who I’ve gone to see a couple of times, thus giving the NW a distinctly Philly flavor and me a gimme.  But there were plenty of tricky clues and general knowledge questions that were unfamiliar to me, so I had work pretty hard to get it all. I found trailer homes for THEATERS and the clue for WINDOWWASHERS particularly piquant (I loved the double Ws). And I enjoyed POLYMATHS just for its own sake.

However, I've noticed a lot more actual modern references, slang, pop culture coming up lately which is refreshing.\n\nI'll echo Josh's comment that Sat is the toughest puzzle of the week. So, more modern clues tend to be earlier in the week. I don't think you're simple-minded, but there is a trick to doing crosswords that only comes with doing them more, regardless of archaic clues/answers. My suggestion is to cheat when you're truly stuck. You'll start seeing patterns to clueing, repeat usage, etc, and start learning/retaining bits of older history which is important I think.
