Go to the puzzle page and tell me if you have the slightest clue as to what clue 39A  is depicting.  You say that you already know?  OK -- give the paper to your mother or your sister or your best friend and challenge them to tell you what on earth clue 39A is supposed to be.\n\nI rest my case.  Except I don't -- not really.  After all, it's not only on the puzzle page that the NYT's complete lack of concern for the subscriber to the physical paper is manifested.

In simpler times, a quarterback would shout a series of \"HUTs\": Hut, 1, hut 2, hut 3...and would have previously, while in the huddle, told the offense on which \"hut\" the center would be hiking the football.  It might be 1, it might be 2, or 3...  The idea was that the offensive line would know the right \"hut\" number, but the defense would not, thus giving the guards and tackles a split-second advantage.
