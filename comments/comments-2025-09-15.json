It only appears in commercial names of a few venues (like the Atlas Arena in the city of Łódź - Atlas is a sponsor), I suppose under English influence. The Polish arena has a much narrower meaning than the English one: in its literal sense it only means the center stage of a circus, ancient amphitheater or corrida stadium. We would never call the center of a sport stadium or the whole stadium an arena. Neither would we use the word for a concert hall or some such.

It involved the installation of a plexiglass (I.e \"perflex\") shield to prevent small pieces of dough from dropping into the machinery of a dough conveyor and slowing the belt,  causing a feedback loop that eventually stopped the conveyor and shut the line down while it was dealt with.

I've enjoyed reading others' comments on the impressive construction of the grid! I especially liked the cross of 25A and 28D, and also 64D.\n\nOne thing--does anybody else solving on desktop have a banner at the top of the screen offering a family subscription? It makes it so I cannot see the last row of the grid, and the puzzle jumps when I get to the final clues so that I can't see the top where the clue is written solo, only the side lists. It's a little thing, but it's driving me absolutely bananas.

The way we pronounce Eli in English doesn’t really have an exact equivalent. Her first instinct was to say it meant “high” and the Biblical priest was spelled with an ע so that makes sense, and arguably that’s probably where the name in English was taken from. (I think Jordan’s insistence on the translation below of “ascent” is also correct but too limited). On the other hand, it could also be a nickname of Eliyahu (אליהו) or something similar with an aleph —her fathers name, coincidentally—which certainly means “my God”—and perhaps is a more common name in modern Israel. And of course there is the song transliterated “Eli Eli” (pronounced AY-LEE) which means my God, and it seems like crosswords have used this translation more often in the past.
