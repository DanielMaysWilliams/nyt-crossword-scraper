In 19A, you reach the TEN rebus and turn downward and complete the answer, HAIR EXTENSIONS.\n\nIn 32A, you follow the advice in 62A.  You TAKE A PENNY and LEAVE A PENNY.  So the first \"one\" (i.e. penny)  in BUY (one) GET ONE FREE is taken (so it's not there) and the second \"one\" is left there.  You have to take one and leave one.\n\nIn 54A, you have the FIVE rebus in there, working fine with the cross (FAB FIVE), but backwards for TREVI FOUNTAIN.  The companion answer, 78A, is NICKELBACK, telling you that the FIVE has to be read backwards.\n\n98A, which solves to NO QUARTER, is the companion clue for 117A (PERCENT).   QUARTER, like the other coins, represents its value in cents, which is 25.  So the clue for 117A, [1/4], solves to 25 PERCENT, but since you are advised to enter it with \"no quarter\", you omit the \"25\", and are left with PERCENT as your fill.\n\nIt's totally logical if you follow the steps.

In 19A, you reach the TEN rebus and turn downward and complete the answer, HAIR EXTENSIONS.\n\nIn 32A, you follow the advice in 62A.  You TAKE A PENNY and LEAVE A PENNY.  So the first \"one\" (i.e. penny)  in BUY (one) GET ONE FREE is taken (so it's not there) and the second \"one\" is left there.

QUARTER, like the other coins, represents its value in cents, which is 25.

It came off oddly to me to see that invoked by an answerer rather than an asker, even though I knew the expression. It seems to me more prudent not to use it when it hasn't already been invoked by an asker (especially since plenty of people remain unfamiliar with it).\n\nMoreover, no general explanation of theme was requested or likely needed. (Perhaps it was needed in the comment that the copied reply was replying to, but sometimes it really doesn't make sense to copy a whole other comment.)\n\nIn the current context, the elaborate assurances of the closing paragraph also came off as unnecessary and potentially patronizing.

A true MACRO actually has a very restricted view -- only the size of a 35mm film frame.\n\nThis is similar to the error that has appeared in the puzzles about zoom lenses. It is almost always clued as synonymous (or nearly so) with extreme telephotos. \n\nI have two wide-angle zooms, and in no way could either be considered a telephoto. \n\nYou can also zoom OUT with a zoom lens, but some people don't seem to understand that. \n\nA zoom lens is just a variable focal-length lens, and its conceptual opposite would be a fixed focal-length lens.\n\nHowever, among people who are not photographers, the word \"zoom\" seems to mean only to zoom IN on the subject to interest, never to zoom out.

On the one hand, a disadvantage is you can't as instantly check on the crosses as you can in the normal grid; but sometimes, seeing it laid out like that helps find an error. And if you don't find one, I guess you just go back to the grid and very carefully scroll through...\n\nOne thing I find is that sometimes I'll sort of blankly accept and ignore an answer that I didn't like but that *kinda sorta works*... and the cross either kinda sorta works too or I didn't catch it. Sometimes I have to screech to a halt and pause and rethink an \"OK\" answer that seems weird, sometimes crossed with a completely unknown word which I just took as something I didn't know! This happened in a recent puzzle where I put MOSTREAD instead of MUSTREAD for a Down entry somewhere in the middle-ish of that puzzle. The cross was a proper name or odd word which I just kept going past over and over again and ignoring. So sometimes you have to say, \"maybe my unease with this answer is because it's just wrong!\"\n\nThose are the tips I can give.\n\nPerhaps I had a bit of ADD myself at the time: Automatic Distracted Dismissal of my misgivings about a clue/ answer.
