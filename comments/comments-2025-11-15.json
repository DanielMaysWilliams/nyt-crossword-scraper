Thus I've never been and likely never will be responsible for the development of any baby. I'm not sure I'd be able to deal with it. There is a small but not insignificant percentage of people who regret having children, and I've always had reason to believe I would find myself in this group. I'm lazy and can't handle responsibility, especially for others. I'm happiest engaging in shallow pursuits, and I don't care about leaving behind any legacy. Also, I've literally never seen parents with children and though: oh, yeah, I'd like to be them! (Or even join them). Vacation with children? Climbing? Going to a museum? Enjoying a meal at a restaurant? Playing video games? Reading in peace? Working at home? The very idea of having to include a baby or child in any of the stuff I enjoy or need to do is scary to me. I don't see it.\n\nAlso, some of the most unpleasant of my memories of the past 10 years (other than true family tragedies and periods of illness) involved being forced to interact with kids in the family. It's all so alien to me, paradoxically tiring and boring at the same time. \n\nStrangely, both my mother and father always obviously loved being parents, yet I didn't inherit their parental instincts.","createDate":"1763230058","updateDate":"1763255388","approveDate":"1763230060","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146666663,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146671670","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7218210101127625}
