Ding ding ding!\n\nVIOL: Originally had lute, which worked when I had roe instead of EEL, rune instead of EMMA (People cast runes, right? And they can be made out of stone?), and SUV instead of GMC. Once I tried the only other 3-letter sushi word I could think of, that section fell into place and I crossed my fingers that VIOL was a thing.\n\nADAPTOR: Did not know this British spelling, although with the overseas clue, it makes sense. It couldn't be ADAPTeR because then what's an eSTENTATION? \n\nLARAM and OMANI: These were the last ones to fall for me. Had tapINTO and diGINTO for 24A, but neither of those was giving me anything that looked like a football team. Finally realized that iMANI should have been OMANI, which led to LOG INTO.  But still, where the heck is Laram? So after finishing the puzzle, I Googled \"who won Superbowl 56\" and slapped my head.

It’s still funny to watch, though.) I wonder if this was intentional.\n•I’m surprised so many people had trouble with NOOR. Even if you didn’t know NACRE, I think it’s a fairly common feminine Arabic name (admittedly, judging mostly from characters in works of fiction on my part).\n•I must have spent a full third of my solve time on the area around LA RAM. It seems the NFL is the area of sportsball I’m the most clueless about; I’m not even sure if I’d ever heard of the team before. (At least with with college sports you can often guess a university name without any specific knowledge of their programs that presumably exist to give med students CTE case studies.) Also, am I missing something, or is ANT for 37A an example of what we call in solver jargon “green paint”?\n•I think REVERSE ENGINEER was the first time I’ve ever had a spanner as my very first answer filled in; the others required a few crossings and some pondering, so still some nice crunch elsewhere.\n\nFun puzzle overall.","createDate":"1755855831","updateDate":"1755888523","approveDate":"1755855833","recommendations":7,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144455795","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.49884599447250366}
