I’ve spent some time reading up on this, however (peer-reviewed literature, not Wikipedia etc.) and, while Crazy Horse was certainly Lakota, a couple of thoughts on your post: (1) The Lakota people are a subgroup of what we call the Sioux, so referring to the broader term in the clue is not incorrect (I’m looking at this from a linguistic perspective—forgive me if there are others that would counteract this); (2) the claim that the French (if I may jingoistically point out here that it *was* the French and not we who arrived at the name*…) called the Ojibwe people and language ‘Sioux’ or ‘the enemy’ based on an Iroquois term for them belongs in folk etymology. There are other theories, and theories they will remain—including the one you’ve cited—as something as abbreviated as the monosyllabic /ˈsü/, with its etymological history mostly oral, based on centuries-old accounts by settlers who were not linguistic scholars, will never be sufficiently attested. \n\nModern English and its speakers certainly don’t think of the Sioux as ‘the enemy.’ As @Andrzej and @Ιασων point out, many demonyms stem from less-than favorable impressions of first contact, yet they persist. After centuries, they no longer retain the initial taste of misunderstanding or conflict (no one thinks of the Berbers as barbaric, the Poles don’t think Germans are mute). \n\nThe clue may be broad for Crazy Horse’s people, but it’s not meant to insult. \n\n*[smile]","createDate":"1767620221","updateDate":"1767671726","approveDate":"1767620221","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147771957,"parentUserDisplayName":"Autumn","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147777210","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6001166105270386}
