Nothing.  So I took another break, came back, deleted everything up there and started from scratch with my thinking cap readjusted, and this time spelled  KABUKI correctly, which made a big difference because not many first names begin with a “U.”  Ultimately, it all came together up there. \n\nTLDR:  True Saturday test for me.
