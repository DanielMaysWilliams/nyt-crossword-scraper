Nor would one ever consider mentioning such motion in any sensible definition. I get that crossword clues are not intended to establish an obvious or unmistakable 1:1 correlation between a clue and its answer, but i will die on the hill of saying a clue needs to winnow the field of possible answers further than (checks notes) **99.9% of all solids and liquids that have ever existed on or near earth or any other planet.**\n\nIf you response is to point out that I haven't mentioned the fact that ashes are, in fact, associated with fire. Of course, but by the present standard, it would be just as well to clue ASH with \"fire sale,\" because ash is often sold on the open market. \n\nOr with \"fire bug\" because ashes can certainly bug people.

In fact, Telling me it took you 3 minutes less time than average does not give me a good idea of how easy the puzzle was for you.  Your average for this day could be 10 minutes or 60 minutes.  To compute relative degree of difficulty, subtract today's time from  average time and divide that result by average time.  For me that would be (21 - 29)/29 = -27%.

Ash is, of course, a product of fire, but I still can’t see the “goes down” part. The volume of ash goes up during a fire, and a significant percentage of ash particles are of small enough aerodynamic diameter that they float away from the fire, so may not go down locally. If the clue is merely saying that ash settles after a fire, I agree it is weak.","createDate":"1769601915","updateDate":"1769643308","approveDate":"1769601917","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148429208,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ned S","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148430943","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-28","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6503975987434387}

Talk about rabbit holes: When I first read that line about the Gauls, I scoured Strabo, Pausanias, and co. to see where Mann may have got the myth. I finally concluded he must have got it from an illustration to an 1881 book by José Coroleu, Las Supersticiones De La Humanidad, which was, I admit, a letdown. \n\nAs I recall, in the chapter you’re on, that exchange between Settembrini and Hans is such a masterful metaphor for how the intellectual inertia of most of society reacts to the finest humanistic ideas our civilization has ever put forth. (You just have to make allowances for Mann’s orientalism. He was a man of his era, like anyone else.)\n\nRe. the translation.

In the book, though, Settembrini’s invocation of Voltaire is doing something more symbolic: Nature refers at once to the “mystical and evil” forces of disease overtaking his own body (Mann has staged illness as epistemology in the novel) and, more abstractly, to what Enlightenment reason sets itself against. \n\nWhat’s interesting is that the character of Settembrini uses Voltaire as an anti-Nature witness,\nbut Mann knows that Voltaire after Lisbon no longer trusted either Nature *or* Reason to make suffering intelligible.\n\nMann seems less interested in adjudicating Voltaire than in showing how even secular humanism preserves a quasi-theological structure—with Reason inheriting the role of Providence.","createDate":"1769613433","updateDate":"1769616607","approveDate":"1769613434","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148433285,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148436085","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.814785361289978}

I just want to get an acknowledgement in before today's comments get swept aside.\n\nI think Simon underestimates the modern reader.\nA smattering of knowledge of German myth and folklore is not all that rare.  The tales of the brothers Grimm and Wagner's operas have had quite some exposure even among those with no direct experience with the works themselves.\n\nSome of the suggested translations replace specifics with generalities.  \"Fuss and bother\" for \n\"Stops and formalities\"  because Hans would know what happened on border-crossing trains does not mean that the English reader would.  Perhaps even Germans in these days of the EU and Schengen protocols would not.  Similarly, \"dissipate or erode\" instead of \"cut up\" does not describe the inconvenience of interruptions and inconveniences along the route.\n\nSome examples seem to be matters of taste and are no big deal.  \"Grubby\" vs \"Soiled\". \"Chillblained\" vs \"Frozen\". \"Bony\" vs \"Withered\".\n\nThe two long discussions of A Soldier and Brave\nand The Lindentree are special cases of underestimating the reader's familiarity with either Goethe or Schubert.
