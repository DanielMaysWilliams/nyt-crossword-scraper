Nearly every illustration has some error or lacks clarity with how the sign is presented.

There are so many things to worry about and be afraid of in today’s world and this forum is a wonderful refuge.","createDate":"1721245114","updateDate":"1721366023","approveDate":"1721245116","recommendations":19,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134748947","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-17","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.589227557182312}
