The puzzle highlighted one of my favorite foods ‚Äî MAPOTOFU.  When I was learning how to cook during my college years, it was one of the first things I learned how to cook.  After graduating, I was looking for a summer job and walked into a Chinese restaurant here in suburban Ardmore where my fianc√©e and I had enjoyed several meals and asked for a job.  To my surprise, the owners interviewed me.  On the strength of my ability to describe how to cook MAPOTOFU (and perhaps also because I agreed to tutor their 8 year old son in English) they offered me a job as the third cook.  I spent a great summer learning the restaurant trade and the secrets of Chinese cooking.  Fast forward 20 years, and after years of living in Philly I moved back to Ardmore, and went back to eat at the restaurant, where the son was now the head chef, and he and I are friends to this day.","createDate":"1733196592","updateDate":"1733312474","approveDate":"1733196596","recommendations":99,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138016772","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9523501992225647}
