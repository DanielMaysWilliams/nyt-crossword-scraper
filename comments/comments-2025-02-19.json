Wednesday is usually my favorite puzzle of the week, so it was especially unpleasant to experience what I did today.\n\nFirst, I had no idea what the theme was about. Was it... Quilting? I'm sure somebody found that cute and oh so loved the puzzle - good for them, and I actually mean that. I, however, know no quilting terminology so the only thing the theme did for me was hinder my solve.\n\nSecond, the secluded section of the puzzle with the baseballer and some abbreviated organisation crossing was just nasty. At least I got NBC on my own there... I did an alphabet run for NS_ and _ANO when that was my last square left. However, all those letters later I still did not get my happy music. By this time I was so annoyed I just checked the puzzle. It turned out I had another bad square: at the crossing of the actor REo and GASToPS. The latter looked good enough (especially to somebody who has never heard of a GAS TAP), and I didn't know the actor. For an additional level of annoyance: I *did* remember another Stephen from that movie, Fry. But noooo, let's ask about *another* Stephen why don't we...\n\nMy final move was to reveal the C of NS_ and _ANO.\n\nAgain, meh.

All the players you see on the field, including the pitcher, are from the same team (call them Team A). The opposing team (B) comes up to bat, one by one, with a goal of hitting the ball and getting to base before Team A can retrieve the ball and “tag” the B player with it. There are 4 bases, numbered counterclockwise, that the player must traverse (in order) before scoring a run. Getting to a base without being tagged means safety. The number of bases a player can run depends on how far they hit the ball and how fast the opposing team can retrieve it.\n\nThe batter can also get to first base without actually hitting the ball. This is known as a “walk” and it’s awarded to the batter when the pitcher doesn’t throw the ball properly. Once a player gets safely to a base, they wait for the next batter to hit the ball, and run while that ball is being retrieved.\n\nAt the end of the inning, the teams switch positions and Team A takes their turn at hitting the ball and running the bases, while Team B works the field.\n\nI hope this helps.

There could be 15-20 players on each side. Baseball bats completely unknown.\nIf the bowler/pitcher threw the ball really badly, the batter had 2 choices - do nothing or run to the first base (someone's jumper/sweater). You got 3 turns at trying to hit the ball. On the third miss you had to run anyway. We were all about age 10-11 or under, so not good at hitting balls.\nBut if the ball was hit a good distance, you kept on running round and round!\nA main rule was the batter had to drop the bat before running, because there was only one bat.","createDate":"1739970317","updateDate":"1739993444","approveDate":"1739970319","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139903569,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mike","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139910017","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7329027056694031}

It was the first one (and still the only) that catered to Jewish people in its state. The entire community came together to create and support this facility and it grew and was known for its excellence. \n\nFast forward to, hm, I'm thinking the 1980s or '90s. It was decided that a community quilt that would celebrate the community would be created... I was not there, so I can't comment on a lot of the decisions that went into creating this amazing craft. \n\nBut I loved to talk about it whenever I gave tours of the building, because this was an entirely created-by-hand quilt. Women from the community organizations all sat around this huge fabric, each working on their own organization's block, and sewing it together. Meanwhile, their children (who are now adults) were sitting beneath it. \nThe children caught the needles as they went down, and sent them back up! \n\nI love to imagine the gossip those children heard, and what they learned, as that immense quilt was created! It is still there, having been removed while the building was renovated, but returned to its spot immediately after, and only removed for cleaning and repairs over the years. Guests love to stop and marvel at it as they walk by, and some share reminiscences of being \"under the quilt.\" Oh, and there is a companion book w/ the story of each square.","createDate":"1739978246","updateDate":"1740016412","approveDate":"1739978247","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139913577,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139916153","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7111359238624573}
