How could that be?\n\nWell, I figured out the theme, even though I knew none of the themed across entries 🤣.\n\nI have no idea what lye soap is, I've never heard of the Hawkeye state or rye seed oil. I got those answers with crosses once I understood the theme.\n\nSadly, the first themed entry eluded me. Believe it or not, a Polish law professor does not know the Latin for a gecko's foot bristles. Shocking, right? I have not heard of a tie dye shirt, either. Thus the crossing of the two defeated me - I revealed it. Then I looked up tie-dye. Ok, you tie the shirt to get patterns while dyeing. I don't think the process has a name in Polish. I seem to remember my cousin experimented with it in the late 80s or early 90s.\n\nThere were so many unknowns in the puzzle for me, in general! HART, ALOU and  CAPO I had to look up to get crosses going for other entries. I've seen ALOU here before, but the clue meant nothing to me, and the few crosses I had there were not enough for me to recall it today.\n\nCUD and EVES DIARY were enigmas but crosses revealed them.\n\nISIAH dawned on me with a few crosses - I know him from these puzzles only as I've never seen a single full basketball game. TOTO came to me, too, even though I'm not really familiar with him. Is it an Oz thing? It is, isn't it? I saw the movie once, I think, 40 years ago, and didn't like it so never rewatched it. There were more such realizations for me.","createDate":"1747281249","updateDate":"1747376750","approveDate":"1747281251","recommendations":30,"replyCount":13,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142144512","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5910027623176575}

The punch line was said to be uttered by the philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser, but the article was a profile of the (then young) philosopher, Saul Kripke.\nHere's the passage:\n\n\"At a rarefied seminar in England, a philosopher  of language [allegedly J.L. Austin] once presented a formal lecture in which he announced that a double negative is known to mean a negative in some languages and a positive in others but that no natural language had yet been discovered in which a double positive means a negative. Whereupon professor Sidney Morgenbesser is said to have piped up from the back of the room with an instant, sarcastic, 'Yeah, yeah.'\"\n\nI remember thinking at that time that my new life goal was to be as clever as Professor Morgenbesser.","createDate":"1747319512","updateDate":"1747348260","approveDate":"1747319513","recommendations":14,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142151538","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5700588822364807}

I felt confident that NO NO was the way to enter them because that equals a yes. Even though I've never seen them done this particular way, it was probably experience with rebuses that led to that confidence.\n\nI commiserate with those who had trouble figuring out how to enter them. What first brought me to these comments was a rebus puzzle for which I knew what the answer should be but had worked an hour and a half on, trying to figure out what the squares would find acceptable, with no luck. I was already well into my current streak and finally decided to put a mental asterisk beside that one and come here. Where I found that the intended form of rebus entry was one I had never thought of, and less elegant, to my eye, than my solution. \n\nBut I discovered this community.

Is it not amazing how it can get things wrong? I'm using Google autocorrect, which is generally very good: certainly better than what I experience on the iPad I use occasionally. Still, it keeps making the same mistakes over and over, even though I keep correcting them, trying to teach the algorythm something.\n\nFor example, in Polish \"and\" is \"i\". \"My wife and I\" would be \"moja żona i ja\" in Polish. We generally never start a sentence with \"i\", so a capital \"i\" is really not a thing in Polish. However, for some reason google will randomly \"correct\" my \"i\" in the middle of a sentence in Polish to an \"I\"... It's been going on for years.\n\nAlso, even though google autocorrect takes context into account, it keeps mixing up \"ze\" (with) with \"że\" (that).

My current streak is several years long. I'm very familiar with trick puzzles, the rebus feature, etc.\n\nThis is not just a rebus issue. You have a combination (YES across two boxes) going across and a different combination (NO) going down. Out of the thousands of possible ways to enter an answer, it was looking for one specific combination that didn't even have the letters for the across clues.\n\nI'm not asking that only entering [NO][NO] should have been rejected. If that's what you did without any fuss or muss, congrats! But please don't explain to me why it wasn't confusing, because looking at the comments here, it objectively was.\n\nI don't think that asking for some kind of hint on how a non-standard puzzle works mechanically is out of line. If they don't want to give away trick puzzles, they could just have it display generic \"If you need to enter multiple letters in a box, click the Rebus button\" kind of message, even on normal puzzles.\n\nI can't think of any good reason not to do it.

I’ve read about how to fill in rebuses, whether they’re shared across and down or separate. Here it seemed like somehow you needed to write “yes” across the two boxes and “NO|NO” for the down. So I tried similar combinations to you, e.g., “y/NO|es/NO”, but those were a no-go. I ended up going to the column to learn that I should substitute “yes” in my mind when I saw “NONO” across. I’ve been similarly flummoxed when invisible letters were supposed to be written inside the lines or outside the grid (i.e., not actually written at all, just imagined). It generally makes sense when you get the explanation, but seems impossible to figure out a priori. I don’t know whether this counts as a lack of experience, failure to figure out the last fraction of the theme, or unfairly arbitrary puzzle design.
