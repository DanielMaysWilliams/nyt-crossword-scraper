Stays are NOT the support for a corset, they are a completely separate garment! (It's plural, like 'pants'.) You're thinking of bones or boning, which were once made of wood or whalebone and are now made of plastic or steel. \n\nStays predate what we think of as corsets, which only showed up in the mid-1800s (and which were only ever used for the famous practice of waist-cinching and tight-lacing by a select few of high fashion elites, like the Kardashians of the day). Stays were worn for centuries before that, and contrary to modern popular misconception, most women liked them!\n\nGeneral, they were stiffened with bone strips or lots of long, skinny reeds, like pick-up sticks bundled into long narrow pockets which gave the stays flexibility. They laced up the back, as they had a wide plate in the center front called a \"busk\", which helped the stays serve their primary function of creating smooth lines under dresses, showing off expensive fabrics and embroidered stomacher panels, and supporting the weight of many layers of skirts (necessary in the days before central heating).\n\nI can say from experience that they're also great back support for manual labor, great boob support for larger ladies, and because it's very difficult to do any waist cinching with them, they're very comfy.
