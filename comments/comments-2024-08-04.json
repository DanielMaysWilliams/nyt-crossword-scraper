So I spent a beautiful summer afternoon at Shea Stadium with the hopes of just seeing one victory.\n\nThe opposing team, the Giants, were pitching their ace, Juan Marichal, whom the Mets could never beat, and who would be in the Hall of Fame by 1983.  The Mets sent out a journeyman pitcher who no one else remembers, Dennis Ribant.  Naturally, the Mets fell behind, and the score was 5-0 by the bottom of the 7th inning.  The site baseball-reference.com retroactively calculates that at that point, the Mets had a 1% chance of winning.  Oh, well, at least it was a nice day at the ballpark.

Ron Swoboda, who would become a World Series hero three years later with an amazing catch ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpk7aX_Qawk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpk7aX_Qawk</a> ), was sent up to pinch hit with Bill Henry in to relieve the ineffective McDaniel.  Swoboda hit a long home run to deep left field, bringing in three runs, and ending the game with a walk-off with a score of 8-6.\n\nWhat an amazing and unexpected finish for a 10-year-old boy at his first major league game to witness!  And of course, three years later, my Mets, in defiance of all that was possible in the world, won it all.  The seeds were beginning to sprout; four of the players in that game were on the 1969 championship team.\n\nAs a 10-year-old boy, and again in even greater measure, as a 13-year-old, I learned what feats of amazement and incredulity existed in the world; I realized that no matter how unrealistic the hope, possibility always existed.\n\nAnd hope springs eternal.

I was 10 years old at the time and it was my first trip to a baseball game ever. If you know me at all, you know I'm a serious baseball fan, and a New York Mets fan specifically, and this game is probably the reason why.\n\nThis story will probably need to be told in several parts, so be forewarned.\n\nI often hear that baseball is boring, that football/basketball/hockey/soccer has more action/is more interesting. I think it mostly depends on how you were brought up. For me, baseball was always there, in season, with football for most of the off season.  The other sports were mostly ignored (although my parents got into tennis later). My father was a high school and later, a minor league player, but by the time I was born, he was just a fan. I was born two years before his original team, the Dodgers, left for LA, and he couldn't root for the Yankees, so when the Mets entered the majors in 1962, he rooted for them.\n\nIf you know baseball history, you know that expansion teams weren't given much support to field good teams back then, and so the Mets foundered in last or next-to-last place through 1968. If you were a fan, you just rooted for them to win the game you were watching; a championship was out of the question. (The '69 world champion Miracle Mets upended all that.)\n\nCONTINUED.","createDate":"1722779588","updateDate":"1722812693","approveDate":"1722779591","recommendations":10,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135189627","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-08-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9640480279922485}
