I've been watching some documentaries on TV from those days, for like \"Power Rangers\" and a lot of the other after school shows for the 9-12 age group (which was well after my time).  \n\nThey worked those poor kids to death, and the kids and their families didn't really get all that much for it.  They couldn't because they had no leverage.
