But no, that brain is agile, quick, funny, witty, and crammed with minutiae as ever.  Amazing!\n\nToday's puzzle is a beauty, a cleanly filled super-low-word-count grid (66), a design never seen before in the Times puzzle.  One that includes a super-high 18 longs (answers of eight letters or more), which can bring color and interest to the puzzle, i.e., NEAR EARTH, ROPES INTO, KALAMAZOO, and SLACKERS.  Those first two, by the way, are NYT answer debuts, bringing pop to the grid.\n\nThere were a pair of shorts (a pair of shorts – hah!) I liked as well.  ROISTER, for one.  I just love how that word looks and sounds, and all the images it brings with it.  SCROD, for another, which is just fun to say, IMO.\n\nI especially loved [Phrase on ID tags] for FAMOUS POTATOES (another debut), and [Woodstock artist] for SHULZ. \n\nPut all this together, and there’s that Peter Gordon spark.

What I truly hated, however, was the “Housemate, e.g.” clue. It should have been “Housemate, i.e.” or, more appropriately, just “Housemate.” The use of “e.g.” led me away from answering “Cotenant,” which I had initially typed in, because “e.g.” means “example,” and “Cotenant” is not an example of a housemate it is another word for housemate. So, more like an “i.e.” of housemate. An example of a housemate or cotenant would be “brother” or “best friend” or something to that effect.
