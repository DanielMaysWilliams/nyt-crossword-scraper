I feel a bit bad about this especially since Nathan cited it as one of his favorites but in the interest of precision …\n\nThe OZONE HOLE, the environmental problem addressed by the Montreal Protocol, is *not* a climate issue. The ozone layer, a region of the stratosphere, absorbs almost all of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation — thus protecting life on the surface (including us). In the 1970s, scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) — manmade chemicals used in refrigeration, cooling, aerosols, and other applications — were depleting the ozone layer (atmospheric circulation and polar temperatures means that ozone depletion is concentrated over the poles, leading to a “hole” over the Antarctic where the lowest ozone levels have been recorded). The 1987 Montreal Protocol instituted a phaseout of CFCs (and, subsequently, other ozone-depleting chemicals) that has led to a dramatic reduction in ozone-depleting substances, leading scientists to project that the ozone layer will slowly recover to 1980 levels over the next several decades. \n\nAll of that is a triumph of science and international diplomacy. However, it is distinct from climate change.

In fact, the last time I had thought about Hemingway was in high school, when I rammed my way through 4 of his novels in the space of a week or so and wrote the usual essays. I had called his prose pithy and had thought it terse; called it unadorned and meant simplistic. I spent the next 30 years calling it my least favorite prose style.\n\nWhich was simplistic.\n\nI went back to Hemingway last summer, prompted by something I read. In a space of a week or so, I breathlessly read 4 novels. And then I spent the next week or so just thinking. I marveled at how much could be said without saying much about it at all. I thought about Hobbes and thought that maybe Hemingway had read him—of course he had read him—and that he then set out to append an adjective to a declaration of his: that life was “nasty, brutish, and short”— and also beautiful.\n\n“The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”\n\nThe chapter ends there.

While the *problem* of ozone depletion is not a climate issue, the *solution* to it — the Montreal Protocol — has been leveraged to help address the climate crisis. \n\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are industrial chemicals developed largely as a substitute for ozone-depleting CFCs. While HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer, they are powerful contributors to climate change, with global warming potentials hundreds or thousands of times that of CO2. \n\nThe Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, agreed in 2016, adds HFCs to the list of controlled substances under the Protocol and thus sets a timeline for their phasedown as well. Some analyses project that the Kigali Amendment will avoid 0.5 degree Celsius of warming by 2100, which would represent a major contribution toward meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C.","createDate":"1706450797","updateDate":"1706680314","approveDate":"1706450799","recommendations":23,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130762999,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nat K","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130763283","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7189284563064575}
