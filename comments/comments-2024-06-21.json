Somehow, I've always known that about the Mafia, even though I don't know anything else.

No, I have never even seen Godfather 1.  \n\nBecause their \"thing\" is not my thing. I don't find them colorful; I don't find them remotely interesting. I don't care about their weddings and I don't care about their funerals. I don't care if they're good fathers or lousy fathers.  \"If you'll just leave me alone,\" I say to the Mafia, \"then I'll leave you alone.  Go swim with the fishes, for all I care.\"\n\nSo 1A went in promptly.
