I loved that show, loved their success (tragically short in Siskel's case) but I also missed their outgrowing their PBS origins.  What a success story!  And there is a lot of hilarious literature about pranks they played on one another--I think it's pretty clear that they weren't exactly bosom buddies.\n\nEbert's five-fold repetition of \"hated\" in his North review is something I've used numerous times for things I despised.  What a happy surprise to see it in the crossword puzzle.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean I glided to a perfect landing.  I plucked around for quite a while fixing an embarrassment of errors.  Not nED, but JED.  Not LAUREl but LAUREN.  Not IPoD, but IPAD (which was tough with the cross, that could go \"a\" or \"o\".)\n\nAnd every time I found one of these I was overcome with relief, only to be shattered when all I got was another \"Sorry\". \n\nAnd each time, I could feel a tiny but vital bit of life force draining from me...that was dumb.  I just felt annoyed.\n\nI think my problem is that I consider doing the puzzle as the price of admission to the comments.

Per Wikipedia, “Shales was known for his withering putdowns of shows he disliked, and was nicknamed ‘Terrible Tom’ and ‘The Terror of the Tube’.”  I recall hearing his reviews on NPR’s Morning Edition in the late 1990s as I commuted to work.  He was also a guest co-host on “Roger Ebert & the Movies” after Gene Siskel passed away.","createDate":"1764136632","updateDate":"1764217096","approveDate":"1764136633","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146897172","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7526369094848633}

Nevertheless, it was pretty easy to complete the puzzle and figure out that it was Roger Ebert whose reviews were quoted.\n\nBut the happy coincidence for me was the answer to 38A. For days now I've been wracking my brain trying to remember the name of a phenomenal indie movie, likely the very first indie movie, I saw in the early mid-80s, and NORTH made it pop into my brain. The movie was El Norte, and few here have probably ever heard of or seen it. I urge you to either find it online or at least to read the Wikipedia article about it. It is so poignantly and heartbreakingly apropos of what is going on today, but also interspersed with a bit of comical relief. Roger Ebert is even quoted in the article, and Wikipedia cites the one scene I remember best, when the heroine is exposed to the modern convenience of a washing machine.\n\nEl Norte received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 1985. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". I hope that the current thugs in charge of destroying our culture don't rip this film from its place in the LOC.","createDate":"1764160450","updateDate":"1764216695","approveDate":"1764160451","recommendations":20,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146899405","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6556509137153625}
