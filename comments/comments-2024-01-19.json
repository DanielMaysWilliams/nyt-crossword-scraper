The Overstory is a fine novel, and very affecting; there is quite a bit of sadness in its leaves, be forewarned, and while trees tie the book together, it is the varied stories of the humans that is most captivating.

Like \"DIJH.\" But in the end the music played without so much as a slur. \n\nI'm a little tired of ERTE being the only Deco artist permitted in these puzzles (perhaps CASSANDRE, LALIQUE or the sometimes used ICART), yet ERTES over TREES is so fetching an anagram that it was a beaut. And steep, soak, in hot water. Cuppa tea, Mr. Hyde?\n\nI had to laugh seeing MAGE as answer to \"good speller,\" mainly because Puzzlemucker tinkered with that one a few days ago when the puzzle had all those wonderful --ER misdirects and puns. If I remember, PM's was \"bad speller\" ... Crazy how that happens!\n\nThe stores analogy seems a little outdated. I would say Chain Store:: David; AMAZON:: Goliath would be more truthful. 1990's calling: they want their clue back. \n\nSay, ah...I should let it ride.

A half-note C tied to a dotted-quarter note C adds up to a value of 7 eighths, which there is no other way to write in modern notation. (Curiously, there was a single note with that duration in early music: a colored-in whole note!)\n\nOne of the important lessons I got from an early teacher is one that I earnestly pass on: a slur has two equally important meanings.

Loved it, but definitely a two-cups-of-coffee puzzle for me. I went down a few rabbit holes in my research, the longest and most fascinating being to understand Bladderball.

After that I got several footholds in the bottom half. Last spot to fill was the NW, where I got ELIS only after a long Wikipedia side trip to understand Bladderball.\nA perfect Friday puzzle IMHO, so thanks Jacob M. and the whole team. I loved your comments too, Deb, and you made me feel a little better when I heard you have The Overstory in a pile waiting to be read, because I do too.

The bladderball was huge, I don't know where it was stored but once a year they would inflate it and roll it out onto the Old Campus a huge green in a quadrangle surrounded by freshmen dorms.  All Yale undergrads were affiliated with one of the (then) twelve residential colleges, and there were some rivalries.  So the actual bladderball event basically consisted of masses of people, some in t-shirts affiliated with their colleges, shoving this massive ball around.\n\nI think the eventual goal was to roll it all the way to the President's house, about 1/2 mile away.\n\nIn my time there was a rivalry between my college (Saybrook) and the next college over (Branford) in which, on bladderball weekend during brunch, some Branford students sneaked into our dining hall and opened the windows looking out onto the Branford green, where Branford students with fire extinguishers filled with fish juice were waiting to spray the concoction into the dining hall.  I remember our Master and Dean and several other people got splashed.  I got fish juice on my favorite winter coat!\n\nThe following year, a group of 12 Saybrook students took revenge, but they went way over the line (I'll spare you the details); I think all were suspended, a couple had lawyer parents and sued, and it was a big mess.  That was around 1977.  So, not the proximate cause of Bladderball being canceled in 1982, I don't think.\n\n\"Fun\" memories!","createDate":"1705713320","updateDate":"1707071210","approveDate":"1705713322","recommendations":19,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130578597","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6804982423782349}

Ultimately the gardener in me prevailed, and those answers unlocked the SE and finished the job.\n\nI think the latest cold snap accompanied by our first measurable snow in quite some time will spell the end for the brave daffodil that bloomed just before Christmas and persisted into the new year.  It’s not unusual for daffodils to be poking slightly above ground this time of year, but this is the first time in 30 years in Ardmore that one has actually bloomed before late February.  A small collateral benefit of climate change I guess.
