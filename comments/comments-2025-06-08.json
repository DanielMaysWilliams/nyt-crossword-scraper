It wasn't all that difficult (app says 36 minutes under my average), and the trick was clever enough but a bunch of fills were just ... unsatisfying. \n\nIPS?

(If the clue had been singular, and the answer was IPA, I could live with that. I still wouldn't be happy, but I could live with it).\n\nAnd as others have pointed out BATTLEROYALES doesn't \"feel\" right. Merriam Websters prefers it without the final \"E\", but does have \"BATTLE ROYALE\" as a variant, so that's OK. But then it goes on to list lots of plurals:\n\"battles royal or battle royals or battles royale or battle royales\" - the last of which was chosen by the constructor. Still, it feels ... unsatisfying.\n\nAnd there's more. I won't go into detail, but MESH, OMG, OPTOUT (among others) feel forced.\n\nThen there's things like LAS, BEG, DUD, and ROO (among others) that felt like lazy cluing.

To be fair, constructing such a puzzle isn’t at all easy. However, I would’ve liked to see the theme entries make more sense, being direct counterparts of each other. \n\nFor one, as others have pointed out, the “matched” animals have nothing in common. I was hoping for direct counterparts from, say, different continents; gnu with elk, rather than owl. \n\nSecond, the theme entries were not counterparts either. E.g. noodle bowls and egg foo yung dishes have literally nothing in common; and China has noodle bowls too, btw. And are we to assume that all action stars have abs of steel?\n\n\nVery disappointing.","createDate":"1749403459","updateDate":"1749423762","approveDate":"1749403459","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142693549","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-08","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.819613516330719}

Took me the time Sundays used to take, over an hour. (When I first started these, might have taken me a few days over an hour.) No lookups, but for awhile, thought I was going to have to look up the preservative. \n\nLove that it required going back to the theme to find my letter amiss. That square was _only_ checked by the theme, and discoverable only after reviewing my theme answers and noticing yet another theme symmetry, and seeing that my answer violated it. \n\nI had thought the four letters to the right of each set of magnets had been scrambled to pull the 3-letter animal to the magnet. But now I could see they were not scrambled, but cleanly bent toward the magnet. Except for one. Although I did realize ACTIONaToR did not make a heck of a lot of sense. Unless it was some kind of homage to The Terminator, which as far as I knew, Stallone had not appeared in. (Had no idea about Statham.)\n\nAt this point, it was clear I just needed to read those last four letters in (backwards) order to make sense of 9D, and the incorrect letter was obvious. Done.\n\nFeeling pretty good about myself, I read the column and then discovered there was yet _another_ level of theme symmetry I had not seen--the paired downs. \n\nKugelman, I bow to you.","createDate":"1749403904","updateDate":"1749449703","approveDate":"1749403904","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142693671","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5150660872459412}

Pitchers pitch to a certain part of the zone if they are skillful enough to do so, but different batters are more proficient in certain parts of the zone. But of course, the better batters are proficient over a larger part of the strike zone. \n\nPitching away means pitching to the farthest corners of the zone (as seen by the batter) or even a bit outside the zone in order to entice the batter to swing at balls he doesn’t have a good chance of hitting.

The kind of thing to be found in Chinese restaurants catering primarily to non-Chinese palates and probably bastardised to suit. (Even though yes, originally egg foo yung is an actual Cantonese dish). In Australia that particular cultural niche is filled by sweet and sour pork 😂\nie It can be seen by Chinese as not “real” Chinese food\n\nAnd noodle bowl is just painfully vague in a way that’s common with Asian food but not so much with European food. Referring to a dish as a noodle bowl and calling it Japanese is a bit like cluing “pasta bowl” as Italian. Like yes, there are dishes which are literally pasta in a bowl but you would refer to them more specifically, as linguine carbonara or spaghetti bolognaise or even say beef stroganoff if it is served with egg pasta. (Then we’d be cluing “pasta bowl” as Russian I suppose!)

I can't understand thinking constructors are having some motive other than just making fun puzzles for people.. and I can't understand the comments that imply those of us who like the puzzles are fake. It's all very bizarre. But as I said in a comment to Steve L earlier, look at the world around us.... It feels so us versus them in every single way these days.
