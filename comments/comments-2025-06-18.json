Of course we engaged in something similar as Polish kids in the 1980s, but the game never had a name.\n\nAnd finally, that ATOB... I really tried to parse it once it emerged from crosses. I looked and looked at it and its clue... Nope. I needed the column to understand what I was seeing. I don't really get the connection between the clue and answer. To me, A to B is a description of the simplicity of a solution to a problem, which may be something completely different than it being short.\n\nI don't get why CARD solves to WIT - could somebody please explain?\n\nDespite it being mentioned in the column, I still don't understand why 'Long way to go?' solves to HALL. I'd appreciate an explanation of that, too, please.\n\nFinally - not mowing one's lawn is one of the easiest ways to help the environment - especially insects - and water retention in the age of climate change.

I really can't pore over pictures of my youth, or my kids' youth, without an overwhelming sense of loss of that period, when those things were happening.  \n\nSo, in a way, nostalgia is more of a pain in an almost literal sense, than something wistful or neutral emotionally.","createDate":"1750227871","updateDate":"1750297878","approveDate":"1750227873","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142931158,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ed","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142931353","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-18","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.44904831051826477}
