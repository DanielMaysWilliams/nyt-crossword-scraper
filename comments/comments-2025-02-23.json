Every theme pair has at least one debut.  Not only that, but eight other answers have only appeared once before in the Times.\n\nFor me, the difficulty is Sunday-pitch-perfect.

But there were too many clues that led to the answer in a very straightforward manner.\n\nAlas, despite that, the bottom center kept me from the gold star. The crossing of a city nickname, a beauty product name, and the name of the residents of a location with its own time zone did me in.\n\nI went around in circles (\"Canadians\" fit sort-of, almost) several times before I threw in the towel. I gotta say that four vowels in a row really threw me for a loop. \n\nCheck puzzle showed me the two letters that were incorrect, which allowed me to obtain the blue star otherwise unaided. So not a terrible performance, but still disappointing for my frail ego.\n\nOnce again, I saw how the peculiar limitations of my knowledge of the world made a puzzle harder for me than for many of you. \n\nOnce we get back to some Spanish, 1970s TV fare, and video game references, I will do better.","createDate":"1740330352","updateDate":"1740362306","approveDate":"1740330353","recommendations":7,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140027318","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-23","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8584482669830322}

I solved it in good but not record time. The circled letters had no bearing on me solving this, however, I always marvel at that sort of wordplay. Thoughtfully clued through for the most part. \n\nFascinated by the history of the House of Tudor, I loved that there were two of the six wives of Henry VIII included in this puzzle. It's always sad to contemplate the fate of any of Henry's wives, but I feel the most (although hard to choose) for the dutiful and pious Catherine Parr.  Within her short life of 36 years: she outlived two husbands; was almost ready to marry a third when Henry chose her to be his queen/nurse; the ailing Henry dies; she has to marry her previous beau in secret since it's only four months since the king died; she dies after childbirth less than eight months later. Her husband, Thomas Seymour, is beheaded for treason six months later, and her orphaned daughter's whereabouts afterward is not known for certain.

Some see the term not as a slur but question why a segment (cis) which includes approx. 99.5% of the US population needs to use a special modifier to distinguish them from the remaining 0.5% (trans) who also use a modifier.
