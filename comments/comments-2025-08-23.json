Piece of cake: ME! But John Ezra was one letter short, so I filled in Ohio River and was off to the races.  The two rivers that form the Ohio are the Allegheny and the Monongahela. Ohio comes from the Iroquois for \"great river;\" Monongahela from the Unami for \"falling banks\" -- and some translate it as meaning, \"muddy mess of a bloody polluted yuck river. We call it \"The Mon\" for short. At one point I told my friend Amy to call me Don Juan of the Mon, but she demurred. \n\nAllegheny is from the Lenape for \"best flowing river\" or simply \"beautiful river.\" It is. Canoeing down it on the upper parts is a dream. In 1748, a party of French came down the Allegheny from New York and put leaden plaques, huge things, above the banks of the river, claiming the land for France. A priest who came along, Pere Celeron, kept a journal, in which he recounted dining with an Indian queen, Aliquippa, with her retinue and his companions, numbering 27 people in all, inside a hollowed out tree. \n\nYou can take a riverboat from here to Cincinnati.
