I especially loved the clue for AHA, which usually has such a boring clue, and when I finally completed the southeast, I chuckled at the GIDDY UP and the theme.

And the sentiment of the poem was shared by me, which made it resonate even more.\n\nStopping by Woods is much shorter, but gives me the indescribable feeling of being alone at the edge of the woods at dusk, with snow falling all around, enjoying the silence and maybe the mystery of the dark woods, as if I was there.

Actions have consequences, and not all of them are nice. \n\nSecond, I actually like people criticizing my work - in my case, my students critizing the way I teach my courses.

It's an interesting point, but ultimately not one with which I agree. I don't think compliments need to be defended; I like it when folks play nice.

But hey, it's a puzzle, it doesn't have to contain the same emotion and message of the lovely original, and to each their own on their interpretation of the poem and their enjoyment of the puzzle! (Plus lately I think the point of  literary reimaginings is to miss the message of the original anyway, for better or for worse, and in this way perhaps Joe's rendering achieves that goal.... but that's a different conversation.)\n\nAside from disliking the theme (and the run-on clues), 30D/34A felt like a particularly unfair cross to me, but perhaps I just dated myself--both of those people are before my time.

Between text abbreviations and rap musicians who get rich without even knowing how to spell correctly, it must be a no-brainer to put together an insipid puzzle like this. All you need do is come up with some arty-farty, pretentious little trick like this one had, and then fill in the crosswords. If you get stuck, dont worry, just google what youve got and hey, presto! You will find the solution in one of those two categories of ineptitude. If worse comes to worst, theres always some foreign language that no one knows. And its foolproof, because Will Shortz and his band of trend-suckers dont care much, as long as the money keeps coming in.
