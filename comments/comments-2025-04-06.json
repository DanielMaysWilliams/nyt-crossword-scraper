So my slowest Sunday in a while, though still enjoyable.\n\nStill a bit vexed by EPIC clued as [Grandiloquent], though---I got there fast enough, but it feels like a stretch close to breaking point.\n\n[And thanks in advance for the almost inevitable M-W url, which will be posted in defence/explanation of the link between clue and solution. I can actually see there's a connection, I just think it's a tenuous one which ignores a large difference.]\n\n[And also, thanks, I don't need to be told that crossword clues are hints, not definitions. I've got that one covered, too.]\n\nAnything else...? I don't think so, for now. \n\nSomewhere I have a blog post that deals with -loquent words, of which there are a surprising and useful number.

This is something we crossword solvers note all the time.  We may be tempted to put a word into the grid, but if it leads to the cross having the letters \"xrz\" in succession, we will almost certainly pause before entering our guess.  That letter combination doesn't look like it belongs in an English word.\n\nIn dealing with foreign languages, our familiarity with what sounds and letters and combinations is less certain, but we still have  some experience and expectations.  ERHU went against my expectations with respect to Chinese, but, given how little I know that language, this was not terribly surprising.

But basically, it works the way it is displayed for the shaded letters. So, at 53 across, for example, you get SCIONS. When you follow the revealer and spin it, this time to the left because that makes COMIC STRIPS. \n\nBecause you keep spinning, they are both right, though granted, perhaps not appearing that way to you at the same time.  But they are considered right for the puzzle because that's the trick.\n\nAs for your mobile issue, I solved on mobile today to and I use an Android Galaxy phone and pull up the app. I had no problem filling in the gray squares... So I'm not sure what to say about that. \n\nBut if you lose your streak because of this, because the app isn't working for you, you can email <a href=\"mailto:NYTgames@NYT.com\">NYTgames@NYT.com</a>...
