I'll summarize what I understand from multiple nuggets in multiple episodes...\nBecause of the dominance of the Norman French in England for centuries during the usage of Old English and development of Middle English, for a long time French was the language of law and government. During the Hundred Years War, however, English regained its place of pride in England. What ended up developing in our language was a lot of phrases consisting of [synonym 1] and [synonym 2], where one of the words was derived from a French root and the other was derived from a Germanic root. (Law and order, facts and figures, etc). This reflected the institutional memory of French dominance, as well as the renewed importance of English (and, in turn, its Nordic Germanic roots). Often, we end up with words that are actually distant-cousin versions of cognates -- derived from the same Proto Indo European root word, but having traveled through different paths in Europe to arrive at seemingly completely different words.","createDate":"1728252651","updateDate":"1728777473","approveDate":"1728252653","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136677246","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6095882058143616}

The grade in question, \"C+ Fix!\", is not being assigned to you the person about to try solving the puzzle but rather to the puzzle creator, John Kugelman, by his sister, Julie Buffington a.k.a. \"Mrs. B\", who teaches second grade. The printed puzzle note (alas not visible in app or browser) concludes with this: \"For authenticity, she [Mrs. B] provided all of the red pen marks in this puzzle's original submission.\" I love this detail; it, and the photo of a teacher here in the article, remind me of how fortunate I was to have a great teacher back in second grade, and I hope that many solvers here have a similar nice memory of second grade. Thank you, Mr. Kugelman, for a truly delightful puzzle that also salutes great teachers for whose impact on our lives we should all be truly grateful.","createDate":"1728228788","updateDate":"1728251824","approveDate":"1728228791","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136667490,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rebecca","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136671376","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-10-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7073320150375366}

Barry can give you the link to the original definition and its history. Andrzej gets at it above.

Running the alphabet, I didn't see anything else that would work as well as \"B.\" But Andrzej points out that to him, other letters looked equally as probable. Whether it is a true natick hinges on that point, which is what makes Andrzej's response so interesting.\n\nSome people say that something is \"Naticky\" or \"a personal natick\" when a cross of two proper nouns is frustrating but does not meet the definition. Drawing on an example from yesterday, an obscure proper noun crossing THISBE might be considered a \"personal natick\" for someone unfamiliar with Shakespeare.
