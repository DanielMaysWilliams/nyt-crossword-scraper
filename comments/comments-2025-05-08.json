It took about a year of solving before I was able to get some Thursday themes on my own. It always feels great to figure out the trick. Then again, given my rather simple mind I'm resigned to failing this time of the week, too. A tricky theme combined with unfamiliar fill will always get me. Today was one of those days.\n\nThe fill was just impossibly hard for me - all those names and trivia were just personally ungettable. Combined with a theme I just could not understand, it made for the most frustrating solving experience since the art heist Sunday abomination many months ago. \n\nI had to reveal 20 answers, if not more, which helped me to get some others on my own. However, I just did not get the theme, at all. I understood that probably some letters were out of bounds (because they butted out?), but which and why those? In the end I just gave up and turned to the column, and then revealed the puzzle.\n\nI'm notoriously bad at thinking outside the box in some contexts, and I'm probably not very smart, either. That's on me, obviously. Still, it feels bad to be reminded of it by a puzzle 🤣\n\nAlso, I really don't like the clue for (s)ENTRIES - I only understood it with the column's help. Sentries don't say \"halting\" - if anything, they say \"halt!\" I know there was a question mark in the clue, but c'mon... \"Halters?\" would have been better, IMO.","createDate":"1746683259","updateDate":"1746786087","approveDate":"1746683261","recommendations":18,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141984135","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7657548189163208}

It seems like if ñ is included, it should also be an ñ in the crossing direction (not an n). \n\nI’m not just venting; I would genuinely like to know the reasoning, or maybe hear another example of this that explains how it’s a consistent puzzle style guide and not just an allowance for ñ.

I giggled my way through the entire solve. From the bonus theme entries of ANO and URANUS to all of the BUTTing OUT words being synonyms, I thought it was a brilliant Thursday construction.

We had left St Louis, MO that morning heading to the Meramec Caverns. We were up to the letter U and my son hollered out URANUS. Well, of course I didn’t believe him. He swore he saw that word. Sure enough, just another mile down the road was the giant advertisement for the URANUS Fudge Factory 🤣 We saw at least a dozen signs advertising this legitimate company.

I’ve never written a grant proposal seeking a “nice chunk of dough.”\n\nThe clueing for SEEP is tricky in one way: SEEP is not quite a synonym for permeate, but prepositional phrases derived from it are: coffee can either SEEP or permeate into your pillow if you’re not careful in the morning.

But as the spouse of a Japanese, TOTORO and PLUM were gimmes for me. \n\nSan PABLO? Guess neither of us was aware that the northern section of San Francisco Bay is named for St. Paul. Meanwhile, those more familiar with the SF area gleefully entered those five letters in a trice. \n\nIn other words, it’s not trivia when you know it. \n\nTHOU is slang, so I think the clue was fair, because it also included a slang word (“dough”). That word tipped me off that the answer may be a slang word, too.\n\n100% agree that SEEP and “permeate” are poorly matched. I don’t hate it, but it doesn’t feel right.\n\nMOPE, though, is a very good match with “to be down in the dumps”, I think.

Took 'em out and voila, finally! I liked the level of difficulty and the theme was kinda cute, but how it was structured, I guess you could say, well, they can kiss my BUTT, if you'll excuse my French...","createDate":"1746737124","updateDate":"1746766174","approveDate":"1746738600","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141993134,"parentUserDisplayName":"Eric Ressner","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142003073","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-08","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7574623227119446}

I don't understand why so many people here are arguing that it's somehow obvious not to use rebuses. There are plenty of trick puzzles where some of the crosses don't form valid words, so why would this one be any different?
