I do know firsthand that interacting digitally is considered crossing the picket line -- as more and more of our lives move online, so too have picket lines. \n\nWhen adjunct faculty at The New School struck in Fall 2022, we were told we couldn't interact digitally with students, full-time faculty, or administrators through any app managed by the university. That extended beyond school email, grading platforms, etc to Discord, which my students used for messaging with each other and faculty. So it was no-go, even though it had zero bearing on the school itself. \n\nAt The New School, pretty much all full-time faculty walked out in solidarity -- a huge risk for them.
