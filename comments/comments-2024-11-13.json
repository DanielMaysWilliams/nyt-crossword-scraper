In the end what is the difference between instantly knowing an actor's name and looking it up? The crosses you get from it are exactly the same, and remembering a name is not a matter of skill or ability, linguistic or otherwise.\n\nLooking up tricky non-trivia clues I do personally consider cheating: when I see I would have to resort to that, I just turn on auto check and forego my gold star.\n\nBut that's me.

I'll add that the crossword world does have the equivalent to the Tour de France: the annual tournament, usually held in Stamford, Connecticut in the spring.  There, the only aid you have in solving is a pencil.  I've never been, but I keep meaning to go, and then I come back to the notion that crossword solving shouldn't be a competition.  (Although the tournament serves as somewhat of a convention, and a lot of the participants on this forum do get to meet IRL.)\n\nThat being said, any other time you're solving, you set the rules.  Beginners should think nothing of using whatever aids they need to finish or to enjoy the puzzles to their best ability.  But as you get better, you might choose to set higher goals for solving.  Eventually, you might be good enough to say that anything other than tournament conditions is cheating--for you, that is!\n\nI cut my teeth on crosswords back when the only way you could substantially cheat on crosswords was to do them in a library.  So I never used outside help, and if I couldn't finish a puzzle, I just looked at the answers the next day.  But you do learn more by so-called \"cheating\", and probably get better faster.\n\nParticipating here also helps you improve.  For example, you might read that UTZ has appeared 13 times, all but one since 2010, so you should commit that one to memory...\n\n(I didn't know the rapper, either, but neither did I see him.)","createDate":"1731499205","updateDate":"1731543944","approveDate":"1731499209","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137559921,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137560533","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7300251722335815}
