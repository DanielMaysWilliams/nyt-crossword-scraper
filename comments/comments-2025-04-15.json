Llosa, one of the great leaders of Peru (now under unstable corrupt leadership) and a great novelist, essayist, wrote his dissertation on 100 Years of Solitude.  But in 1976, as Marquez was leaning more leftwards and Llosa more rightwards, a misunderstanding led to Llosa sucker-punching Marquez in the eye, which ended their friendship forever. Llosa, a womanizer, had fallen in love with  a woman while on a cruise with his wife, and she had left to go back home, pack up their house and move out. Marquez (called Gabo by his friends) and his wife had helped her out.\n\nGuillermo Angulo recalled:\n\n\"Look, Mario does like gorgeous women and he’s a very good-looking man. Women die for Mario. So Mario, on a trip he made by ship from Barcelona to El Callao, met a very beautiful woman. They fell in love. He left his wife & went off with her. And the marriage was over and all that. His wife went back to pack up the house, but of course Llosa returns, they make up, his wife says, “Don’t think I’m not attractive. Friends of yours like Gabo were after me … ” One day they met in a theater in Mexico City, and Gabo went toward him with open arms. Vargas Llosa made a fist and said, “For what you tried to do to my wife,” and knocked him to the ground.\"","createDate":"1744684569","updateDate":"1744780479","approveDate":"1744684570","recommendations":31,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141430419","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6490553617477417}

CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR has been used as a theme several times before in the major crossword outlets, but never like this.  Furthermore, the theme brought three NYT answer debuts, lovely additions to the oeuvre – CHERRY GARCIA, MAGIC REALISM, and TRAGICOMIC.  Spark and originality … Per-fect!\n\nSerendipitously, many answers fell into a trio of baskets:\n•\tLong O enders: BOHO, NARCO, YESNO, GATO, MIRACLE GRO.\n•\tSchwa starters: AKIN, ALIKE, APPEAR, ASEA, ALARM.\n•\tIC enders: TRAGICOMIC, MAGIC, BASIC, PHOTOGENIC\n\nI struggle with the skill of leaving the revealer out and trying to guess it – not even reading its clue – from the theme answers.  Thus, in an effort to improve, I try to do it as often as I can, even though usually falling short.  But today I got it!  I got it!  \n\nSo, I leave this puzzle with a breath of hope, and thank you for that, Per.  Thank you also for your terrific entertaining theme.
