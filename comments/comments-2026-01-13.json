Finally, you cave, then get the answer, and it turns out to be SO OBVIOUS, you wonder how in the world you missed it.\n\nThat’s the best way to be gotten.  And that’s what I got today after leaving the reveal blank and trying to guess what it was.  \n\nSpeaking of sparkling, three of those theme answers are NYT debuts, and the fourth  (MECHANICAL BULL) is a once-before.  Nate also beautified the grid, with NICHE, SCONCE, ADEPT, and BATIK.\n\nSERENDIPITY WATCH.  Rare sighting of seven double-L’s, plus, a rare-in-crosswords five-letter palindrome (SOLOS).\n\nCreating this theme out of that iconic rock song title – well, that’s prime constructor mind, Nate.
