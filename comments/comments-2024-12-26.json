And some of the little touches, like LOGOMANIA crossing OFF LABEL. Amused by coffeehouse beatniks for its stereotyping -- there were a lot of coffeehouse poets in NY and San Francisco (and parts in between) in the 50s and 60s who would be horrified to be lumped in with the beatniks. Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery read in the downtown scene, in coffeehouses and they'd be Howling with laughter to be linked to the \"angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night.\" Minor kvetch.\n\nAnd the theme was well done, brilliant that the first two could be entered without \"getting\" the ski lift: \"This\" works as a title, and \"pencils\" could be \"bottoms\" just as \"trousers\" and \"capris\" are. It's only when you get to \"Cash is\" that you know the game's afoot. I'd bet Ms. Dershowitz knew to do it that way. \n\nI wish the ski lifts could have been diagonal somehow, the way ski lifts are. These ski lifts look more like fork lifts, so that was a minor disappointment.  Despite that, I think this is Ms. Dershowitz's best puzzle yet. \n\nGood holidays to all you logo-maniacs out there!

We excitedly got in line to take the gondola up. We were chatting about how relieved we were that we had been able to book a zip lining experience since the first one we booked in Ketchikan had been cancelled. After waiting 20 minutes, we realized that the line hadn‚Äôt moved and neither had the gondolas up the line. They were both stuck about midway up the mountain! We waited another 45 minutes before giving up and getting a refund. We found out from cruise friends that several people hiked down the mountain (a two hour trek) and those poor people on the gondolas were trapped for hours. \nAnyhow, thank you to Ella for this clever puzzle.

Nonetheless, the idea is essential:\n\nThe writer is faced with a blank page/screen. The composer, blank staves. The set designer, an empty stage. The architect and builder, a cleared lot.\n\nWhat this means, its implication, is that everything imposed on that blank is meaningful, even when it is random.\n\nThere are no throwaways. Every clue is meant to be read, even though one may get the finish music without having done so. Every circled square, shaded square, question mark, lack of symmetry, unusual symmetry, big huge shape that dominates the grid‚Ä¶is meant to be read, even though etc.\n\nToday‚Äôs comments section amounts to dozens of admissions of incuriosity. Fine; curiosity killed the cat. Curious cats take down Christmas trees.\n\nBut why so few solvers are unwilling to maintain a curious mind - curious enough to pause and wonder - this is, for me, an eternal curiosity.\n\nI could probably fill in most puzzles (main, and especially mini) without reading all the clues while solving. But I never do. The constructor started with a blank page: every mark on it is meant to be read, understood, realized.\n\nR.I.P.

(Plus, I already had RUBIKSCUBE and SERTA.) So that helped me with R in ATARI and the other two, which I'd left open not knowing if there was a rebus or other trick. \n\nI know the CASHISKING saying when I saw it, but didn't know the Faith Hill song, so it certainly helped me that I had gotten the theme. And it made me smile! What else could I ask for? A real lift!\n\nAnd so, just now, I found THIS KISS online and played it in the car.

DH on the other hand will always be found cheering on his beloved Exeter City, home or away.","createDate":"1735228595","updateDate":"1735262380","approveDate":"1735228598","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138542009,"parentUserDisplayName":"Helen Wright","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138545026","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.4350165128707886}
