The answer set is remarkably smooth, considering the seven OREGONs plus a ten-letter revealer, which greatly constrict the answer possibilities.\n\nAdding to the constriction is that the OREGONs are all in a specific order.

Thus, you can have\n\nORE\nNOG\nas in the lower middle of the grid, but you can’t have, say,\n\nREO\nGON\nbecause in going from OREG to ON, you’d have to make a jump.  If the circles had been allowed to simply be anagrams of OREGON in any order, the grid would have been easier to fill.\n\nAnd, somehow, on top of all this, Peter was able to splash beauty into the grid, with OPHELIA, AGOG, DIABLO, PRIM, AEGIS, and IRONY.\n\nPlus, for me, a pair of bonuses.

It's not a pal or a buddy.\n\nAs the article Paul linked indicates, the original ENTREE was neither a starter/appetizer (as they say by you) nor a main dish (as they say here), but rather a course that was served between the two, which no longer exists in most places.  Rather than ditching the word in both places, Anglophones decided to reassign the French word to another course, because, well, it's French.  Unfortunately, they assigned it to different courses.\n\nI suggest that at this point, we table the discussion for later, and everyone who is complaining have a tamale.","createDate":"1753793229","updateDate":"1753834943","approveDate":"1753793231","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143874873,"parentUserDisplayName":"Spmm","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143879098","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7857363224029541}
