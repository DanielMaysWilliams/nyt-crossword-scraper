You and I had a little back and forth about this puzzle. It seems that I happened to have solved this one at some time is the past in the archives, but unlike you, I missed that there was something very odd about the way the rebus worked. Further, I came to understand that this puzzle was part of a week-long “meta-challenge” where six consecutive puzzles by PB appeared Mon-Sat and culminated in a Sat puzzle with two long revelers hinting at how to figure out the week-long hidden theme. It took me a couple of days to complete all the puzzles, and to be honest I didn’t figure out the “meta-theme”. Deb explained it in her column the following Monday, linked below. I recommend that anyone with some time go back and take a crack at that week’s puzzles. I wasn’t doing the NYT puzzles regularly back then.
