In any case, he never did teach her, she never learned, and now, over the past 18 months, they've both passed away. \n\nIf they had any regrets, such a small thing was probably not among them, but I hope, as the years go by and my partner and I retire and have more leisure time (god willing), that we both say \"yes\" often.","createDate":"1741186292","updateDate":"1741243673","approveDate":"1741186293","recommendations":25,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140317248","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5987223386764526}
