Mingus was a towering figure, both figuratively and literally in the history of jazz, and though he could be hard on his bandmates because he was a perfectionist, he fostered the careers of many fine jazz musicians, including Eric Dolphy and Mal Waldron.  \n\nIconoclastic until the end, in his last months he embarked on one of the oddest musical collaborations ever, as he worked with another iconic North American musician, the great singer/songwriter, Joni Mitchell.  Other jazz musicians had scorned her earlier attempts to infuse her music with jazz elements, but Mingus, recognizing a sympathetic talent, by all accounts, took her under his wing.  The resulting album he inspired, Mingus, while not one of Joni‚Äôs most beloved efforts, is complex and fascinating music.  It is worth a listen just for Joni‚Äôs version of what is perhaps Mingus‚Äôs signature tune, Goodbye Pork Pie Hat, a tribute to saxaphonist Lester Young, to which Joni authored some respectful lyrics.\n\nAnyone interested in exploring the work of Charles Mingus would do well to start with perhaps his most accessible record, simply titled Ah Um.","createDate":"1749210137","updateDate":"1749247535","approveDate":"1749210139","recommendations":16,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142646469","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-06","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7556737661361694}

I am happy to say I beat that, but not my own Friday average.\n\nFor me, this puzzle hearkened back to the days when I more consistently had to go slowly, wound up with more white space than filled-in space after the first pass, wound up with more white space than filled-in space after the second pass, and the dreaded feeling that maybe I might not finish this one.  (Although these days, I have the confidence that although it will take longer, I will eventually get everything.)\n\nOf course, a lot of people say that in the past, puzzles were consistently harder, but I also think I'm a better solver than I was, say, 10 years ago.\n\nThe reason for this extra difficulty seemed to be vagueness of clues.  For example, I saw [New ___] and thought it was most likely AGER, but it didn't have to be.  After all, the puzzle comes out of another \"New (four letters).\"  So many clues seemed like they could have been various things, or nothing came to mind at all.\n\nMy strategy, then and now, is to put in any factually based gimmes (ANN, SAC) and strong guesses (OPAL, ODOR), and try to get a foothold somewhere.  This time, it was the SE, and from there, I managed to circle around the puzzle until all was done.","createDate":"1749215907","updateDate":"1749263148","approveDate":"1749215907","recommendations":19,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142649771","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4544905722141266}

For those unfamiliar with the concept, a rebus puzzle (sometimes called a rebus element) is any puzzle where a square contains anything other than a single letter. This could be a number, a symbol or multiple letters. It might even be a combination of two letters ‚Äî one each for the Across and Down entries.\n\nRoberta Morse made the first rebus puzzle that was published in The New York Times in 1954. It had the numbers 1 to 4 in different quadrants of the grid; there was a numeral 1 in the first square, with the answer 1-DOWN clued as [First vertical word] at 1-Down. A few months later, Roberta‚Äôs husband, Anthony Morse, made the second rebus puzzle we published. This one had the four card suits placed in different quadrants of the puzzle. Since the puzzle was published in print, the assumption was that solvers would draw in a little diamond rather than write out the word ‚Äúdiamond.‚Äù This puzzle had entries like ‚ù§Ô∏èACHE and ‚ô¶Ô∏èMINES.\n\n[to be continued]","createDate":"1749223411","updateDate":"1749259107","approveDate":"1749223412","recommendations":12,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142654405","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8742035627365112}

When solving, I sometimes imagine the constructor at work - for example, I will see them smiling, happy that they thought of a novel, fun way to clue something mundane. The image of the constructor that formed in my head today was one of a person smirking at the prospect of the pain inflicted on solvers. I can see the guy bent over the half-constructed grid like Frankenstein over his monster, putting bits together, twisting them to the accompaniament of evil laughs. The smug author note fits very well with this image.\n\nNot all hard puzzles inspire negative emotions in me.

I wondered if I've been getting dumber, since my average Friday time is 22 minutes, and this one took over an hour. Then I looked at the author and was relieved that it was one I was not familiar with, and went here to look for more info about it, which confirmed how new this contributor is.\n\nFor example, the \"not very animated\" for \"stolid.\" I think of stolid as more of a character attribute than an affect, so it felt just a tad off the nose, if that makes sense. There were a bunch of others. Cantilevers I think of as the entire system of scaffolding attached to a foundation or anchored supports, so for it to be a support itself seems slightly inaccurate. I don't know if the clues were inartful or if I'm just not thinking creatively enough. For the punch out/call it a day, as another example, I feel it makes more sense switched, if \"call it a day\" were the clue and \"punch out\" were the answer, because you have the overall sentiment and then the concrete action/specific idiom, and when it's reversed, it's not a colloquial expression quite as much so it feels random and a little unsatisfying. I'm not one to blame the puzzle as deficient rather than myself, but this one felt notably off.
