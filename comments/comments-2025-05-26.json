And it was a good long one.  When I woke up over an hour later, I finished reading through the comments.  I was at it quite a while before my nap (didn't think to notice exactly how long) and at least a half hour after (I noticed what time I woke up).  I got to the end and decided, well, I have about 20 minutes until the new puzzle comes up, let me refresh and see what came in after I opened the comments at least two or maybe three hours ago.\n\nHaving noticed the heavy volume, I expected at least another hundred or so comments to be there.  But there weren't any new ones.  And the last few comments, which were listed as \"5m ago\", \"8m ago,\" etc., were still the most recent comments, but the time stamps still were the same.  In other words, while I was napping, the comments updated and the time stamps changed as well.  \n\nThere were no new comments because the latest comments were already on my phone, without me updating them.\n\nA fluke, or a new feature?  If the latter, it's a game changer.\n\nThe other thing I noticed that when I went to xwordinfo.com to view the Monday page, it was already on the home screen.  Usually, I have to refresh the page in order to see the new puzzle.  \n\nI honestly don't know what's going on, or if I'm imagining things.","createDate":"1748211357","updateDate":"1748283596","approveDate":"1748211359","recommendations":3,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142388921","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7586647868156433}

It's that you're missing something.  And blaming the puzzle, the constructor, and the editors shows more about you than the puzzle.\n\nAlso, people should note that if you don't get a very unusual gimmick, that doesn't make the constructor lazy.  Constructing puzzles like Sunday's isn't easier for a constructor; it's much harder.  And saying that about a complex puzzle just makes you look like you have no idea about the subject.\n\nThere were two factions, mostly.  Those who hated it, and those who loved it and even some of those who thought it should be Puzzle of the Year.  If you hate a puzzle that so many people absolutely adored (and they were in the clear majority this time), reconsider that maybe it's just your solving level, and not the puzzle's fault.\n\nEveryone is entitled to their own opinion, but every opinion should make sense, and not be an attack.\n\nOne final observation:  So many people complained they didn't see the colors.  The only explanation would be that Show Overlays was off.  Why do so many people have Show Overlays off?  What would compel someone to take that off in the first place; what's the benefit of doing that?  And why is that an option in the first place?  The only thing that turning Show Overlays off does is sow confusion unnecessarily.","createDate":"1748211830","updateDate":"1748322637","approveDate":"1748211831","recommendations":38,"replyCount":19,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142388970","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-26","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6768187880516052}

I don't know why this is, or if it's a universal glitch or if it's somehow tied to my having posted multiple long comments/ links y'day for the first time in awhile, but ALSO, for a month+ when I click on \"VIEW ALL REPLIES\" in a thread, instead of loading more it just disappears the entire thread, including the previously visible posts. THAT happens on my old Android I use for the puzzles, but yesterday's \"invisible replies\" thing happens on even my newer Samsung. Huh.\n\nMy reply to Grant from Delaware about \"The Final Countdown\" movie is only visible (to me) when I click on his post. My reply to Larry from Romania, same.\n\nSo if you replied someone & they haven't replied back, maybe click on the timestamp of your reply or of the thread's orig post & maybe there'll be an otherwise hidden reply beneath it.\n\nOr maybe it's just me.
