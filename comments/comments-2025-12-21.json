Everyone complaining about how easy the last two days were just got their due.\nWas going to say this was going to be the most polarizing puzzle since Art Heist, and then I look at the byline.\nOn the one hand, this is really a constructor’s puzzle. You have to admire the artistry of the construction, imagine finding entries with all the trees, symmetrical, with letters underneath that spell FIR YEW—it really was a magic trick. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely, it was tailor made for my brain even though I had to be dragged kicking and screaming every inch. That includes the end where I had to flyspeck five times before seeing I misspelled TRAN(C)EPTS. So many fun tricky clues I can’t list them. I mean, it’s absolutely brilliant.\nBut also let’s admit it won’t be accessible to many solvers. To get there, most of the long downs had to be proper names or titles—while not obscure per se then at least hard to get if you don’t know them. And if you don’t know them pulling the rebuses from the crossings will be like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. And then the rest of the fill was just not forgiving. BAMA AMIR AMANDA BADU crossing ARNOLD PALMERS, admit it, that’s gonna be pretty brutal for a lot of people, and that wasn’t the only inaccessible spot.\nSo, again, this was absolutely my kind of puzzle and I had an absolutely blast—what a Christmas gift.

Sadly that confirms once again that I am a slave to habit.  I caught on to the trick initially at the great Duke Ellington song PRELUDET(OAK)ISS and had fun searching the forest for the trees.\n\nAs a lawyer I was happy to see the renowned CLAREN(CEDAR)ROW spotlighted (spotlit?) in the themed clues.  While Darrow enjoys a deserved stellar reputation for his representation of John Scopes and other prominent figures, his legacy is complex, as he was twice charged with attempted jury bribery, and may well have engaged in that practice more frequently than is generally known.  There’s a fine history of the case against labor leader Bill Hayward called Big Trouble by Anthony Lukas, which paints a vivid picture of life in the United States (and Idaho in particular) in the first decade of the 21st century as seen through the labor movement. Clarence Darrow features prominently as Hayward’s lawyer, and baseball icon, Walter “Big Train” Johnson is part of the narrative too.","createDate":"1766322207","updateDate":"1766358642","approveDate":"1766322208","recommendations":7,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147457905","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-21","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.43756014108657837}

I think he's so steeped in the language of showmanship that he discusses pulling off a high wire cruciverbal act with the same patter (this will break your brain!) he uses when he's on stage performing magic.

The last time was Mon Dec 30, 2024, which I clearly would have gotten on the crosses, looking back. \n\nOne of my many crossword weaknesses is that I don't always review what I fill  in on the crosses, which deters me from picking up more of the things I should. Trying to be a bit better on that. \n\nStill, there's no way I could have finished this unaided 18 or so months ago, as I did today. It's fun to see progress. And I always appreciate the help and tips from long-time solvers! ☺️","createDate":"1766287367","updateDate":"1766330325","approveDate":"1766287369","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147455708,"parentUserDisplayName":"Chris","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147455841","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6021049618721008}

When it told me I hadn’t solved it, I spent amount of time looking for mistake, but couldn’t find an error. I clicked the reveal to learn that it considered all of (my correct) rebus squares to be wrong , and that I had no other errors. So, I lost my current streak not because I failed to solve the puzzle, but because I didn’t think to substitute the single letters from the horizontal crosses for the rebus answers from the vertical answers.\n\nSo, my comment expresses my exasperation that I correctly entered every clue, but the puzzle programming didn’t recognize my solve . I say this is an editorial problem that puts online solvers at a disadvantage because to get it right, you’d have to think to check the title page (visible in print but not a phone without clicking back). And even with that, the clue offered doesn’t make sense. I get the fir yew pun - it’s cute and another impressive accomplishment in the design of the puzzle. But “under the tree” suggests that the tree is visible and everything else hidden. The “correct “ solution is the opposite. It asks you to hide the trees.\n\nI think the puzzle is great, and my frustration is not about it, but about the way the rebus is handled vis a vis rewarding a correct solution.","createDate":"1766336894","updateDate":"1766362125","approveDate":"1766336894","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147455854,"parentUserDisplayName":"JPeck","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147463406","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-21","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6558407545089722}

The iced tea mixes I buy are flavored: lemon, peach, raspberry, and my favorite, peach/mango green tea.\n\nI rarely am in the mood for hot tea, though.  I know it's a cultural thing in the UK.  I was pleasantly surprised once when some Vietnamese kids whom I was tutoring English offered me a cup of hot tea, and served it to me with milk already in it.  I was prepared to politely sip on it, but surprisingly, it was a good combination.\n\nStill, for a hot beverage early in the morning, it's coffee.
