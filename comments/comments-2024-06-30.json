As they do so, the eye on the down side migrates to the up side. Protective coloration in most fish is dark on top, light on the bottom. In flatfish, the down side turns light, the up side dark. Most flatfish are righthanded: their right side is the up side. A minority are lefthanded: their left side is up. For some reason, lefthanded flatfish are more susceptible than righthanded flatfish to cancer and organ damage caused by pollutants. The fisheries agencies of the European Union therefore monitor lefthanded flatfish as an indicator of ocean pollution.","createDate":"1719701380","updateDate":"1721238776","approveDate":"1719701382","recommendations":72,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134268638","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8634429574012756}

A note on general civility. Like many I occasionally like to grouse about crosswords that in my opinion miss the mark -- too arcane, heavy handed, whatever. Not all crosswords are created equally.

But these guardian angels of the grid are often irksome and condescending. It's just a different opinion, okay? Not every differing thought has to be corrected. Thank you.

I have made a few myself.\n\nI think there would be less of what you call \"defending\" the crossword of the majority of these gripes were legitimate. They almost always aren't. I have no problem with people saying \"I didn't like this\" but far too many complaints are simply people claiming \"This isn't a word!\" (when it is) or \"nobody says that!\" (which is not a requirement for a word to be included in a  crossword - and often, yes, a lot of people DO say \"that,\" whatever it is.) \n\nIn about 90% of the times when a specific nit is picked, it only demonstrates the complainant's limited lexicon and experience or, sometimes misinterpretation of the clue and answer, and not anything remotely wrong about the puzzle. \n\nThose of us who \"defend\" the puzzle will continue to point out when criticisms are invalid. I, for one, will also continue to rebut the very loud minority who whine incessantly whenever there is a puzzling theme on, say a Thursday. Most of us like the puzzles to be, well, puzzling, at least one or two days of the week.","createDate":"1719790700","updateDate":"1719967867","approveDate":"1719790702","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134287566,"parentUserDisplayName":"David Hancock","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134288528","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5265344381332397}
