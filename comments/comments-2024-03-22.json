First of all, good column, Deb! I admired your description of how mentors and veteran constructors have reached out and collaborated with many new voices, and particularly in this case Erik Agard, whose work and hairdo I know well. I do not imagine you're gonna get slagged. Wow! Who knew how jealously we guard our God-given right, here in Comments, to be the sole Solomonic judges, aye or nay, of the merits of each new puzzle? I'm kind of proud of us. You'd think we had a say in things!\n\nAnyway,  what a fine puzzle. I was hoping at first that the meticulously crafted fiction would be WHODUNNIT, a mystery genre well enough known you'd think someone would have employed it by now, but nope, you go to xwordinfo and there's no record of it. It's yours for the taking!\n\nAnd had DOLED vs DEALT for wayyy too long. And my brain said ca va? when I asked about SA_AA (which by the way, is a beautiful echo of your BRAS cluing.

Steve L ascribes it to our Monday Queen, Andrea Carla Michaels. There’s a lot out there to support that. I found a Masters Thesis from Old Dominion University in 2013 by Lynn Feigenbaum that refers to ACM originating this term, but only refers to Rex’s column.
