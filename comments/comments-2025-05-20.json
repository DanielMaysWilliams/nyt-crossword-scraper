Some of that is probably my fault and some of that may be cooking at 7,400+ feet (2,255+ meters). Everything seems to take longer to cook up here. \n\nWith this recipe, you put the eggs in the pan and pop it in the oven to cook the eggs. We had fresh eggs that the receptionist at our dentist‚Äôs office gave us, and I failed to pick four that were the same size. Three of the eggs came out perfect cooked, with the runny yolks that we both like. But the fourth, which I think was smaller than the others, was poached medium.\n\nThe recipe makes four to six servings, so we saved half the sauce for a second meal.
