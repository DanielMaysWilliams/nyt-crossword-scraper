Really, that's the only difference.\n\nBoth JPG and JPEG represent an image format supported by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and have the exact same meaning. The reason for the different file extensions has to do with early versions of Windows not accepting the longer extension.\n\nLike HTM and HTML files, when the JPEG format was first introduced, the official file extension was JPEG (with four letters). However, Windows had a requirement at that time that all file extensions could not exceed three letters, which is why .JPG was used for the exact same format. Mac computers, however, didn't have such a limitation.\n\nWhat happened was that both file extensions were used on both systems, and then Windows changed its requirements to accept longer file extensions, but JPG was still being used. Therefore, both JPG and JPEG files circulated and continue to be created.\n\nWhile both file extensions exist, the formats are the exact same and either can be renamed to the other without a loss in functionality.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/jpg-jpeg-file-4139913\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lifewire.com/jpg-jpeg-file-4139913</a>","createDate":"1704295544","updateDate":"1704379298","approveDate":"1704295547","recommendations":20,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130189614,"parentUserDisplayName":"Solar Ron","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130189961","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8402795195579529}
