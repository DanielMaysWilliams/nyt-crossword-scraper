It’s too bad it solved, to me at least, like a very boring themeless and many people will miss the theme altogether (I was proud to say I noticed it early on which livened the solve for me). There’s just too many Tuesday level clues and entries and anything clever seemed to be easily gotten by the crosses. Wish they had stepped up the difficulty of the cluing and we saw more like “Canniest, for instance” which is about the only one that sticks in my mind.\n\nI think we need another physics analogy to call this puzzle; Schroedinger puzzles exist in two states simultaneously whereas this one, while existing in two states, really hinges on a particle that doesn’t make a difference. I propose “Neutrino” puzzle: neutrinos are particles that are super abundant in the universe and are everywhere, but don’t interact with anything so you don’t notice them. Physicists please elaborate and educate us further; they are colloquially known as ghost particles but I hesitate to bring it up because I’m sure the physicists will chastise me and explain why it’s a misleading nickname.

At one point, having very little after my first across and down pass, I actually considered abandoning it. I liked much of the clueing though, and the theme, which I did not understand yet, did not look like a typical Sunday set of groaners. So I persevered. Some squares I filled in with the digital pencil, expecting having to go back to them later. Astonishingly, all my guesses turned out to be correct. The solve took 35 minutes and no lookups, which is a good result for me on a Sunday.\n\nThe theme was nice and tight, only slightly clunky in a place or two - I wasn't a great fan of the awkward clue for ANT(I)VENOM, and its cross, but I dealt with that, too.\n\nThe crossing of the rapper and composer could have been a natick - I've never heard of the former, but I seemed to remember the latter from previous puzzles, so it was no problem in the end.\n\nBTW. \"Polka\" means \"Polish woman\" in Polish. I just did a bit of research: Polish linguists seem to be unsure whether there is a link between the name of the Bohemian dance and the Polish language.

I’m glad I took my time and savored it. The theme was unobtrusive and clicked so satisfyingly once my slow brain grasped it (i.e., once literally I read the column after solving, lol), precisely because those were all clues that gave a bit of a wobble —even though the answers made perfect sense— like there was more than one way to make them fit. \n\nKudos for some amazing clues: \"Fights back tears?\" and \"Canniest, for instance” were hall-of-fame good. The one about Apple product names and the one where SECRETE didn’t mean “ooze” were also totally fresh. Even such a tired recurrence as KEN had a clue good enough to make me chuckle, and I actually learned something about old ENO this time. \n\nMy one gripe, not to be JUDGY: 121A (“Verbally expresses disdain”). People colloquially use “verbal” to mean “oral,” but I expect constructors to observe the more technical meaning, “pertaining to words.” Though there is much overlap between the two things, tutting is precisely a form of oral paralanguage; that is, it involves sounds coming out of the mouth but zero actual words. When one TUTS, one lives in that tiny sliver of Venn diagram covered by “oral” but not “verbal.” (In contrast, this comment is verbal-unto-verbose but not oral.)","createDate":"1760912933","updateDate":"1760958779","approveDate":"1760912934","recommendations":10,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146048350","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9423691034317017}

I just realized you probably already knew that and, rather, were asking whether, in Poland, the name of the dance was imported together with the dance itself from the Czech or whether it originated from its Polish language meaning of ‘something that is Polish.’ Looking at the history of the polka in Europe as I just did, I doubt it’s the latter: (a) Bohemia’s exporting of the polka to the wider world seems rather recent, maybe 2 centuries, so it can be traced rather well. As it moved from Prague to Paris first, and as Poland appears to have had more cultural ties with France than Bohemia over the last few centuries, the dance is likely to have come to Poland with its “French” name, ‘polka’ the half-step. (b) Huge Chopin fan that I am, I know you already have a culturally important dance the name of which means ‘something that is Polish,’ and that is the polonaise or ‘polonez.’ (And for which, incidentally, you also seemed ti have kept its French name.) Lastly, (c) it looks like your word for ‘dance’ is a masculine noun, whereas ‘polka’ is feminine. That’s an unlikely naming difference for something as recent as a 200-year-old name. I would assume that among your other names for other dances, especially Slavic ones, the masculine form predominates?","createDate":"1760872371","updateDate":"1760961248","approveDate":"1760872372","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146035891,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146035988","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8686997890472412}

I believe some modern composers take advantage of this, as do some non-Western musical scales. \nThe job of tuning instruments so that, for example, the key above C but below D produced a tone that was close enough to serve as either C# or Db was called \"tempering\".

Angela and I studied at University of Ottawa together with the same teacher in the 70's. She has an encyclopedic repertoire - complete works of Bach for starters. Right now she is doing all the Mozart concertos on a world tour. She is great with French music (our teacher was a French music specialist), has recorded the complete Beethoven Sonatas and plays a big swath of 19th and 20th century music. If you are looking for excellent Shostakovich Prelude and Fugues, look up David Jalbert, my colleague at University of Ottawa until I retired 5 years ago.","createDate":"1760918812","updateDate":"1760958855","approveDate":"1760918814","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146048678,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bill","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146048922","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-19","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7983612418174744}
