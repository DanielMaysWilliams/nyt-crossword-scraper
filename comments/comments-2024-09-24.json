Our kie≈Çbasa usually consists not of ground meat but meat chunks - you can actually identify visually what is was made from, rather than having to trust the producers they did not mince the poor animal whole and with its pen and trough to lower costs.","createDate":"1727151760","updateDate":"1727299395","approveDate":"1727151762","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":136403942,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136404172","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6986642479896545}

Line two 9\" cake pans snugly with foil, letting the foil come up the sides slightly. Grease and flour the foil. Stir together the wheat and rice flours. No need to sift. Cream the butter in a stand mixer. Pulse the sugar and salt in a food processor for about 30 sec.--the reason being that American table sugar is much coarser than British caster sugar. Add any flavorings at this point. Add to the butter and continue to cream. Add the flour all at once, and let the mixer run until it begins to come together. Finish off by gathering the dough with your hands. Divide the dough into two lumps. Roll out each lump into a 9\" round, using as few strokes as possible. Transfer them into the cake pans; press the dough out to fill the pans smoothly. You can use a glass tumbler to help smooth the discs. Dock the dough all over with a fork, and score the rounds into 12 pieces (a plastic bench scrap works well for this)--this makes it easier to cut when baked. Bake at 375^ for--?
