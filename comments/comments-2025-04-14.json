I also did not get the theme, at all. It was just too abstract for me. Even having read the column I needed a moment to grasp the explanation. My mind just did not want to make the leap of understanding how you can crack an eggplant. Yes, I know it was about cracking an egg, but in my head eggplant is eggplant: I just don't see the egg there, and there are few things as uncrackable as an eggplant ü§™. Even though it was all spelled out in the column, I needed a good 10 or 20 seconds to process it.\n\nBefore reading the column I ended up checking the puzzle - yes, on Monday - when I did not get my gold star. I stared at the grid and I just gave up.\n\nTurns out chUCKLEHEAD was wrong. Having that exactly same length synonym there rather than KNUCKLEHEAD was an unfortunate result of, first, my lack of understanding of the theme, and second, Andrzej-unfriendly crosses. So how did I not see that mistake?\n\nThe c rather than K came from an answer to the SNL clue - I automatically ignore SNL clues because I almost never know the answer to them (today it was gettable, after all, but what of it - my mind was a slave to its \"we ignore SNL rule\"). The h rather than N was a cross with some band I've never heard of.\n\nSolving in the middle of the night, after 3 hours of sleep, may have been a factor in my failure.

I liked the theme, but unlike yesterday's, knowing the theme didn't help me solve the puzzle. In fact, I forgot to even look at it until I was done and read the column. \n\nVIGODA and ALDA took me back to being 12-years-old, sitting on my grandmother's orange shag carpet, doing a puzzle from one of her magazines that smelled like cigarette smoke while listening to Tony Orlando on her 8-track. Those two names were in so many puzzles back then.\n\nI always thought a KNUCKLEHEAD was a stubborn person who did the same dumb things over and over again, but that's probably because my grandfather used to call my brother that when he got in trouble for doing some dumb thing over and over again. By contrast, I thought a goofball was someone who did silly things on purpose for a laugh, but the online dictionaries don't all agree on that, and anyway, the clue is close enough. \n\nI thought the cross of 15A and 6D were going to be a Natick for me because I didn't know IM PEI and assumed that groupies of My Chemical Romance called themselves by some specific name, but that was only because I missed the \"e.g.\" in the clue. With the rest of the crosses, I could see the answer was just a description, which was easy to suss when only the M in EMOFAN was left.\n\nWeirdly, EGGPLANTDIP took a lot of crosses.

And that got me thinking about folks who complain that they aren't able to get clues right away--that is, without using the crosses. I wonder if it's more than just a resistance to what is the unique mechanic of the crossword: using the crosses to fill in where mere knowledge fails.\n\nWhat I wonder is: how many solvers making this complaint are solving on their phones? Until recently, my morning routine consisted of the Bee, Wordle, and Strands on my phone then the xword on my laptop. I have added the mini, and it's a much different experience **because I can't see the crossing clues** as I'm solving. I've been solving a long time, so work fast on my laptop. For the mini, I'm forced to depend almost exclusively on my knowledge (and/or to retain the clues that are no longer displayed as I solve). I find this slows me down. Similarly, when I've done the big xword on my phone my times are much slower. \n\nI suspect that the interface of the phone app favors existing knowledge, where the interface on a laptop/browser better facilitates the strategy of using the crosses. I'd be interested to hear from people who make knowledge-based objections (\"too obscure,\" \"I didn't know X and so couldn't finish\") about how they solve, and whether switching helps them...","createDate":"1744634644","updateDate":"1744675114","approveDate":"1744634646","recommendations":6,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141402488","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.46001777052879333}
