The word pretentious comes to mind. \n\nIn the \"How to Solve the NYT Crosswords\" article it says that only the clues are harder throughout the week, not the answers. That's definitely misleading for puzzles like this. Although I like the theme, I find too many answers obnoxiously esoteric. For instance, I've never heard of the Young Turk Revolution, Gintano jeans, a Jaguar XKES, the words longo and pate, or of PDQ Bach. Sure, now I have, that's true. And while I love learning from the puzzles, I can only stand so much at once.

Why? Because he was concerned that (Carol) Heiss, the figure skater who defined the crossing entry, might not be sufficiently well-known nowadays.\n\nAs to the nitpicks vis-a-vis DUTCH/DITCH, they are absolutely right: It's syntactically awkward. Yet I found it irresistible, especially given that it doubled-up the upper right corner. (Whose other entry was originally ZANE/MANE, as in Grey hair, as opposed to ZANY/MANY.) And COLT/VOLT is indeed a slight abuse of \"power,\" but this puzzle required some artistic license.\n\nThe TOAST repetition didn't faze me at all, given that the word is only part of the answer and it's being used differently, but the RACKS dupe was indeed real. CD RACKS came out of Joel's late effort, as WINE RACK already existed in the NE corner. I suggested replacing it with WIN A RACE, but CARED then would become CAR AD and we had a few cars already, including within a theme clue.\n\nFinally, my original puzzle had thirteen slashes (unworkable online), which was a faint clue of the pangram -- which I in turn hoped would be a genuine solver's aid as they progressed through the puzzle (what letters haven't appeared yet).

I solved the puzzle without lookups, but basically did so under protest.\n\nSo many problems:\n— JAGUAR XKES may be beloved by sports car aficionados, but that’s well outside common knowledge. I deduced it from the crosses but it felt forced.\n— MMMDCV wasn’t obscure, but it sure was artificial. The feat of a pangram in the themers looks less impressive when you get the V and X from these sorts of gimmicks. \n— VOLT is not a measure of power. A DITCH is not a tunnel. This isn’t a matter of “a clue is not a definition” — they are simply wrong, justified only by the requirements of the theme.\n—“Gummi Bears” is a trademarked name for a particular brand of candy; “gummy bears” is the generic term in wide use. So if the answer is GUMMI then “Bears” needs to be capitalized in the clue. There’s no way around it.\n— Understanding 18D, 24A and 77A relied on knowing what movies a B-list actress starred in 15 years ago, being familiar with a 30th-century classical music satire, and knowing that a country singer popular 50 years ago adopted his last name for the stage. \n\nAgain, I managed to solve the puzzle. I know it’s called a “crossword” for a reason. But when 7 of 13 themers rely on esoterica or outright gimmicks, that’s a sign to me that the puzzle is too clever by half.","createDate":"1738503871","updateDate":"1738580537","approveDate":"1738503872","recommendations":47,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139441593","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-02","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6602892875671387}

It was challenging and layered, with no clues that, as Peter Griffin would put it, \"insist upon themselves.\" It also had the hallmark of the crosswords that first hooked me into solving puzzles back in the late 1980s: respect for the past.  I liked how the puzzles of yesteryear used to make me have to learn about old Hollywood, old language, old sports stars, etc.  They never felt like they catered to me, which made me even more determined to try to solve them.  Waiting until the next day to see what I missed was instructive and also made me feel like I was being woven in to greater culture that was forged before me.  While a young solver would struggle with clues like 75A, 77A, 94A, 123A, and my favorite, 61A (I just last night told my son, while watching old Super Bowl shows that the Vikings have not returned to the Super Bowl since moving into (and now out of) the answer to this clue), they will be learning about various aspects of our culture.

You solved a Sunday Crossword in 1:14:00.\"\n\nAm truly terrified to read the comments. A very interesting concept, especially with no circles to show where the paired letters should go. To me, a terrific example of a puzzle that (might) have been fun for the constructor to create, but which, from this solver's point of view, was pretty much misery---and I love being puzzled. I solved it unaided, but only persevered because the alternative was to start planning my lectures for tomorrow's classes.\n\nSome of the paired thematic clues were clever, but Holland/tunnel for DU/ITCH is hard to take. \"Holland\" as a clue for DUTCH? And \"tunnel\" and DITCH are really quite far removed from one another.\n\nCringed so many times while filling this one in---won't even bother listing the entries that provoked me. Kudos to the constructor for the concept and the construction, but no way on earth I'd ever have published this.\n\nOK, let's take a look at the posts so far. Might be MMDC/V by the end of the day. Hope most will be a lot more positive than mine.\n\n(As a point of information, not a complaint: In non-euclidean geometries, parallel lines can CONVERGE. For example, in hyperbolic geometry, parallel lines can converge to the same \"ideal point on the circle at infinity\".)","createDate":"1738511798","updateDate":"1738564914","approveDate":"1738511799","recommendations":13,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139447049","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.827260434627533}

PDQBACH was perhaps the hardest clue in the puzzle and every crossing was a lookup for me but DOGES (okay, I probably should've come up with ARCH, but still), so that was just a nearly impossible block for me. MRSDASH crossing with MRMAGOO is a monster of a Natick, Mrs. Dash must be regional because I've never encountered their spices and Mr. Magoo is a character I've barely heard of. JAGUARXKES I suppose is fine if you're a massive car nerd, and at least that was gettable through crosses (unless you don't know NESS and put LEAPTto instead of ON like I initially did before lookups), but it was a big example of the pangram damaging the fun of the puzzle.

I enjoyed the theme and rebus answers—most were fun! But overall, it got a bit tiresome to me, especially in the non-theme areas.  \n\nThings like SPEEDCOP, KEYDISH, and LEAPTON, instead of LEAPTat felt odd to me. There were some others like that. They're all valid, but just felt off. Guess they're just not things in my lexicon, so they felt awkward to me.\n\nINABAR at 87A is amusing, since Boston obviously fits. I also liked 126A DOC for \"Happy companion!\" Liked that one a lot! And NONEOF at 70A for \"Your business start-up.\" \n\nI enjoyed the theme enough that I wish it would have run smaller  on a Thursday, perhaps, but then I suppose there would not be a pangram, which is admittedly pretty cool. \n\nAnyhow, ultimately, I did not know the crossing of AGIO and DOGES at 10D/20A, and being so certain of LEAPTat down in the SW—along with not knowing how to end the JAGUARXK answer, and, honestly, just feeling ready to be done despite my  nine unknown squares, I hit reveal. Everything else was correct, so that's good. \n\nStreaks don't motivate me and this isn't work or chores... I don't have to keep doing it if it's no longer fun.  ;-) \n\nOn a related note, sheesh, designer jeans in the 80s!? I wish! I got my jeans from Kmart and that's just the way it was going to be!

And if it got so many people talking, it had to be doing something right! (A rule that doesn't apply to politics). \n\nThis year, may I suggest (to myself as well as you all) that we make a physical note of it when we especially like a puzzle, and nominate them at the end of the year. Like today's: it's a great puzzle, witty, well clued, clever theme, a lot of words you don't often see, all of which qualifies it as a candidate for a Griddy. \n\nThanks again, Eric and CLM!

All had bidirectional squares, with two of the puzzles not accepting “Across/Down” formatting with the others accepting it. The inconsistency makes it particularly annoying.\n\nOf course, for today’s puzzle that combines Schroedinger and bidirectional squares, the “Across/Down” formatting isn’t really relevant.
