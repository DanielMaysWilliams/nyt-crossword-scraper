Probably won't fit in one reply.  Here are items 1-3:\n\n1. Mann uses the word “einfachen”.  Dictionaries give simple, uncomplicated, and straight forward.  Translators give “simple-minded” [L-P] and “perfectly ordinary” [Woods].  I will argue that his character in constrained by this place and time, but that he is in no way an ordinary man.   \n\n2.  The Castorps are not aristocrats.  They have been of the merchant class since 1650, the first date etched on the family Christening Basin.  The six generations listed there have survived despite momentous changes in the outside world.  (The end of the 30 years war, the rise of Prussia under Frederick the Great, and the unification of Germany under Bismark).  Hamburg has remained a self-governing city-state.

He is an orphan.  He has lost mother, father, and guardian grandfather within the two and a half years before the age of eight.  We are told little of his education other than eight semesters at technical colleges ending at age 22.  He has “never met a literary man\".  (I will find more when  I get to later chapters.  Spoiler: I've heard that the first appearance of “the pencil” will occur while he is away at boarding school.)\n\n5. Some personal quirks:  He is angered by the slamming of doors and scandalized by the “activities” of the couple in the next room.  He says things like “I really like the sight of a coffin.” and “Funerals are more uplifting than church.”\n\n6. .Whether the door slammed by Mme. Chauchat (hot cat) is a Freudian symbol of sexual rejection remains to be seen.\n\nEnough for now.  Back to the book and working on notes for Space and Time.
