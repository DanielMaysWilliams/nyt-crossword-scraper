Descriptivism emphasizes the analysis and description of language as it is naturally used by speakers, while prescriptivism focuses on establishing rules and norms for \"correct\" language usage. This essay will delve into the fundamental differences between these two perspectives, their implications for language study, and their influence on society.\n\nDescriptivism, rooted in the belief that language is a dynamic and evolving system, seeks to understand language as it is spoken and written by native speakers in various contexts. Linguists following this approach analyze language patterns, structures, and usage without passing judgment on what is considered \"right\" or \"wrong.\" Instead, they aim to document and describe the diverse ways in which language is used, acknowledging the rich tapestry of linguistic variation and change. Descriptivism recognizes that language evolves over time, influenced by social, cultural, and historical factors, and seeks to capture this complexity in its analysis.\n\nPrescriptivism, on the other hand, advocates for the establishment and enforcement of linguistic norms and standards.

When it comes to generic categories, it wouldn't make much sense to invent the name for a genre before there are any examples of it. That means that genres are named retroactively, after there are enough examples to demonstrate the existence of the general category, and are thus intended to be applied retroactively to works that retrospectively fulfill the generic conventions. Genre is always an anachronism.\n\nA good example of this would be the novel. When literature critics discuss whether the Tale of Genii or Don Quixote is the first novel, the question is about whether they demonstrate the features of the genre, not about whether Lady Murasaki or Miguel de Cervantes knew the term \"novel.\" Is E.T.A. Hoffman's bizarre textual experiment The Adventures of Tomcat Murr postmodern? How about Sterne's Tristram Shandy? Well, not historically, no, but generically? Perhaps!
