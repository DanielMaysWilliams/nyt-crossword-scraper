Many of us are more familiar with ERP for phobias.\n\nThink of a person with arachnophobia, they might first talk about spiders, then look at photos, then see preserved specimens, then be in the room with a live spider in a terrarium. The body gets used to the hyper-arousal and habituates. For some OCD cliches, think of not hand washing as frequently, or putting up with distress after a handshake without using hand sanitizer.\n\nThe APA holds this as the gold standard treatment for OCD. Not CBT. Your brain unlearning the fight/flight response through repeated exposures is the most effective treatment and this an intentional triggered state of hyper-arousal.\n\nIf you or someone you know is diagnosed with OCD, don't look for a CBT therapist (the most commonly advertised, and useful for many disorders thus the starting point for many therapists). Look for someone who advertises a knowledge of ERP.","createDate":"1732411527","updateDate":"1732438966","approveDate":"1732411531","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137840823","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7123804688453674}

It just shows how long you’ve been solving on the app. For example, David Connell will always be about 200 days ahead of me until one of us stops solving for one reason or another. It doesn’t mean he’s better than me, only that he started using the app about half a year earlier than I did. \n\nAt that point, faster solving speeds are the only way to monitor improvement.  Faster solving means that you can see tricks faster and have a better vocabulary than you once did. \n\nYou go slowly if you want, but don’t find fault with people because they solve faster than you. It doesn’t mean they’re speeding through the puzzle.  \n\nI can savor the solve and the cleverness of the clues when I’m done, and extend my time by participating in the comments. \n\n9:45 today without rushing.","createDate":"1732379561","updateDate":"1732401424","approveDate":"1732379565","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":137831921,"parentUserDisplayName":"SteveG_VA","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137833537","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6359260678291321}
