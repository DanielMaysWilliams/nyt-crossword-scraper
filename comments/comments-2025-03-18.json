I consulted my wife on the sandwich, and bread and roll debacle from one of yesterday's posts. You may remember I was unsure how exactly something is qualified as a loaf (\"chleb\"), and something else as a roll (\"bułka\") in the Polish language and culture (because at present size and ingredients are not always so different between the two). My wife's theory is: historically, bread was made cheaply, from cheaper ingredients (such as, rye flour rather than wheat), as it was plebeian food. Rolls on the other hand were made for rich people, using expensive wheat flour, without bran etc. They were small and dainty, brilliantly white inside - unlike the commoners' huge, rough loaves.

But, the way I would look at it is that if on the first pass through the across clues you answered each correctly, you would not need to spend any time even reading the down clues. The time for puzzle completion would simply be how fast you could write in each answer. Similarly, the more across clues you could *not* answer, the more down clues you would need to spend time reading.

I eat eggs very rarely (and hens and other post-embryonic-stage creatures not at all) but my husband partakes most days, so I’ve made him watch PETA videos on the subject. As a result, we’ve always bought eggs that are as humanely produced as possible. Still, in the U.S., even for eggs from small farms, the USDA requires that they be washed and sanitized. This process removes that protective membrane European eggs retain—bloom, I think is called?—that allows your eggs to be kept unrefrigerated, unlike ours. It also removes any down from the hen—unlike on your eggs. So the first time I ever opened a carton of eggs here, imagine my surprise to see downy fuzz on them.

Yeah, European eggs have all sorts of stuff on them, including the hen's feathers and bodily fluids, because, as you say, they are unwashed. Americans are often terrified by the concept. What about salmonella?! Well, regulation of the egg-producing sector involves stringent health standards, making our eggs and poultry products, including meat, generally very safe without submitting them to unhealthy chemical treamtents like the US use of chlorine. Salmonella cases have been extremely rare over here since EU accession - and they pretty much only occur when some egg producer fails to follow regulations (which occurs rarely because of the costs in the form of product recall, PR fallout and administrative fines).\n\nAlso, because our eggs are not a health hazard, we like our scrambled eggs barely set, and we gladly eat our eggs soft-boiled, which also seems to terrify many Americans.

I had no idea how rare that is: frequently there is a specified pre-tax amount taken out. We also were provided lunch every day -- because we were not allowed to leave, in case we were needed. (Yeah, totally illegal, but who were we to say anything?) This was at one of the top art galleries in the country, where I didn't make enough salary to fully cover rent.\n\nA few jobs and two years later, I had what I considered a big pay bump (to not quite 25K) working for a well-established brokerage firm. As was typically the case for an entry-level job, I had a minimum of benefits, which would increase after five years working with them. Ten vacation days plus six sick days per calendar year (paid).

Thanks for sharing! I do wish things were more standardized (in a good way, like you have) here. \n\nIn my adult working life, I've had excellent benefits, especially where I am now, but a lot of my friends and family have not had that experience. \n\nI was reminded recently by a good friend that she only has 10 hours (yes, hours!) of vacation time available. I try to remember to not talk about my benefits with her... I feel bad for her. Here I am, absolutely forced to have a fun Tuesday off with my husband, and she's just scraping by hoping her kid doesn't get sick.  :-( \n\nCurrently, I can accrue 28 days of paid vacation, which is where I'm at now and will no longer accrue if I don't use some. If I'm sick I just don't have to work but still get paid regularly. I would need a doctor's note after two consecutive weeks of sickness. If very prolonged, I'd have to go on a short-term disability and get 75% of my salary. I also have 10 paid holidays. \n\nI work at a university and am on the same plan as faculty, which is why it's so good, I think, even though I'm not a faculty member.\n\nOthers who work there don't have as good of benefits because they have different job classifications... yet their benefits are still way better than a lot of people. \n\nI'm so grateful for what I have but I so wish everyone had it. \n\n\"We all do better when we all do better.\" (Paul Wellstone, U.S. senator until his very untimely and tragic death many years ago.)","createDate":"1742336213","updateDate":"1742350702","approveDate":"1742336214","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140692159,"parentUserDisplayName":"HeathieJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140693124","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-18","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7229119539260864}
