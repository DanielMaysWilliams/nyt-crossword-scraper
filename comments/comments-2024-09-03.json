The puzzles do let politics in occasionally, for instance GAZA was clued as a \"Mid-East place of conflict\" back in February, Biden's and Obama's names turn up, as well as many other political figures, living or dead, but one would be hard pressed to assign a political leaning to either the editors or the constructors, much as one would think the demographic would be overwhelmingly blue.  \n\nOne can possibly spot some political leanings from absences (not a lot of Hitler, Nazis, fascists, autocrats, for example: most of the people whose names appear in the puzzles have made positive contributions), and in fact, \"Trump\" has never appeared with a clue about the former guy, whereas Biden has appeared a few times.","createDate":"1725333583","updateDate":"1725412064","approveDate":"1725333585","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135896785,"parentUserDisplayName":"NY Expat","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135897274","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7978715896606445}

My only stumble was groks.  I had the first E and the S, so I overconfidently filled in gEtS, without bothering to look at the crosses for the g and t, which of course made no sense. To my surprise I got the dreaded almost complete message and had to go back and check my work. With my mistake at the bottom of the puzzle, it took a minute to see but SEE it I did.\n\nI was happy to see my hometown NL East leading Phillies (sorry Steve L) get a shout out.  It’s been their best regular season in quite some time and I’m hoping it bodes well for the post season. I’m sure the clue for that answer will vex some non Philadelphia area or non sports fan puzzlers - but cheer up, it should be easy to get via the crosses.","createDate":"1725330621","updateDate":"1725425848","approveDate":"1725330624","recommendations":22,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135896641","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6861382722854614}
