Like the old Warner cartoons (Bugs et al.) it works on multiple levels, so parents can watch it with their kids without being bored, and kids can go back and watch as adults and catch new meanings.\n\nBrain's voice is modeled on Orson Welles (go ahead, you cannot unhear it). In one glorious episode Pinky and Brain have to go to the studio for a looping session (how insane is that?!) and it's largely drawn from Orson Welles' notorious studio melt-down recording a voiceover for a Paul Masson wine commercial. I won't link here, but all is searchable.\n\nLastly, in every episode at some point Brain asks \"Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" and Pinky responds with a total non-sequitor. In our home neither of us can say \"I think so\" without both of us then saying \"Brain\". And I will include a link to 80 of those. ;)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og2nUdtKncE\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og2nUdtKncE</a>\n\nZero Mostel might be my fave.","createDate":"1720385817","updateDate":"1720493340","approveDate":"1720385820","recommendations":16,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134476198","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9029445648193359}

I simply adore both Cervantes and Horace too much to not comment on this. \n\nI believe the quote for 43D may be somewhat incorrect. Originally, that quote was attributed to Horace in the time of Emperor Augustus. However, in Don Quixote when Cervantes used the line, he said “La ___ es la lengua del alma” or “the ___ is the tongue of the soul.” While many translations do in fact still translate it as mind rather than soul, the original Spanish very clearly says “alma” (soul) not “mente” (mind). Therefore the clue would either need to say “per Horace” or “the tongue or the soul” to be entirely correct. \n\nObviously this is just a minor error but I still wanted to share! \n\nAlso, my apologies if there is any reason why I’m just not understanding why this clue is still correct.","createDate":"1720460247","updateDate":"1725926088","approveDate":"1720460251","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134494393","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-07","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.48712074756622314}
