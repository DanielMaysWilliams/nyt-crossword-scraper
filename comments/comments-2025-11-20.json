It had cameos of several well known, life long puzzle solvers, one of whom was Ken Burns. \n\nI recently saw an extraordinary conversation on grief between Anderson Cooper and Ken Burns. Ken was particularly open about the devastating loss of his mother when he was 11, and how his father barely coped. But he allowed Ken to stay up late and watch movies with him. When Ken was 12, he witnessed his father cry for the first time watching a movie together, and Ken said that's when he decided he would be a filmmaker. The movie they were watching: Carol Reed's Odd Man Out. I imagine Ken is doing this puzzle as usual.  I hope the unexpected appearance of that crucial film, out of context, out of nowhere, makes him smile.","createDate":"1763609809","updateDate":"1763712366","approveDate":"1763609809","recommendations":114,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146768499","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6134675741195679}

More of a Wednesday puzzle thematically, and jam-packed with names. Solved it unaided, but took more than 20 minutes, most of it spent in the E and NE.\n\nOf course, the 3-letter male names were thematic, but quite the collection of additional proper names in the grid. Interestingly, and perhaps by design, almost all the non-thematic names were female names---with AARONBURR, MRT and (perhaps) JABBA being the exceptions.\n\nOther than BRA appearing both in the SW corner (in DEBRA) and also in the SE, the grid seems outstanding.

We don't overuse the word \"love\".\n\nWe have noun \"miłość\" and the verb \"kochać\": both mean \"love\". The old Polish verb for \"to love\" was \"miłować\". Another verb became popular with time, while the noun derived from the old verb remained in use. We reserve both terms for truly special relationships with people and animals. One may \"kochać\" one's spouse, child, puppy, or one's closest, dearest friend. But we don't \"kochać\" puzzles, cars, casual friends, etc. I suppose our verb \"uwielbiać\" (\"to adore\" would be the closest equivalent) may serve as your \"love\" when used regarding things one likes very much.\n\n\"Lubić\" is our \"to like\" but we use it differently than you do.

Generally, when describing individual instances of stuff I like, I'd say something like: \"Podobało mi się\" (\"I enjoyed [it]\"), \"To było fajne\" (\"That was neat\"), or \"Spoko\" (\"Cool\").","createDate":"1763625487","updateDate":"1763658983","approveDate":"1763625488","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146768776,"parentUserDisplayName":"B","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146769924","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7728283405303955}

In many games, the character you control gets a choice of many skills, but you can't pick them all - you have to make a choice, because you usually have less \"skill points\" to distribute\" than there are skills to choose from. Also, characters receive equipment from defeating in-game challenges - weapons, armor, and the like. \n\nAn S-tier character is one with the build and equipment providing the best in-game performance.\n\nThe progressions is as follows: S-tier, A-tier, B-tier, C-tier, D-tier, E-tier, F-tier. I suppose it's related to the American grading system, for the most part.\n\nEffectively, S-tier characters are likely to make the best progress in a game, but the characters themselves are not the game's \"elite\". If anything, some *players* may be considered a game's elite, yet not necessarily for playing S-tier characters. The most respected gamers manage to outperform others even though they do *not* in fact play S-tier characters. In one of the games I used to enjoy, a person played a character who had no gear equipped, at all, and yet me managed to beat all the content. He truly was among the elite. There was another person who defeated challengers designed for groups of 10 or 25 people - solo. But it was about personal skill, not S-tier characters.","createDate":"1763633536","updateDate":"1763650595","approveDate":"1763633537","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146770260,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146770306","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7131977677345276}

Have you watched or read \"The Lord of the Rings\"? Along the way Frodo receives the magic ring, the mithril shirt, a magic sword, magic elven food - he is making progress as an in-game character would, recieving gear (and some skills) as he godes deeper into the \"content\".\n\nThe basic premise of many action games is that you start with a character clad in rags and only able to perform basic attacks with basic weapons. As you progress, you learn new skills and acquire equipment. By the end of the adventure, you are an unstoppable powerhouse, looking epic and being able to single-handedly defeat a couple of dragons as you use the other hand however you enjoy most.\n\nEnjoy this learning opportunity :D\n\nI also believe you'd actually enjoy some of the games I play, if you gave them a chance with an open mind.

I was deep into gaming theorycrafting back then (that is, working out how to best use a game's mechanics to have the most fun - math was involved! The horror!), and I designed a build for the Amazon character that definitely was not S-tier, but which provided me with unbelievable fun - my heroine shot a zillion arrows a second, speeding across the game's world like a bat out of hell. It was so awsome!\n\nNot all games are about fighting. The ones with build tiers usually are though.\n\nSome games do involve fighting but put in a moral context that shows violence for what it really is. The acclaimed game The Last of Us (made into a series by HBO) did that to great effect. Each of the two characters I controlled had to fight for his or her life, but there was no glory in it, only terror and and sadness.","createDate":"1763643874","updateDate":"1763660028","approveDate":"1763643876","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146771656,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146771941","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5719991326332092}

On the other hand, I wondered how Andrzej might react if someone here in the comments were to post a similar treatment of, say, musical theater? 😀","createDate":"1763649952","updateDate":"1763662270","approveDate":"1763649952","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146772361,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146774320","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7171547412872314}

Our passions bring meaning and happiness to our lives, and so it's good to know people have them.\n\nOf course, if I encountered an in-depth analysis of musical theater, however passionate, I'd just skip it. I may be happy about another person having a passion, but its subject may remain completely uninteresting to me, or even personally repulsive, like musicals.\n\nThe figure skating season continues. Following the sport has been a passion of mine for decades. The athleticism and the artistry of it provide me with an almost s3xual enjoyment. And yet... Each time somebody skates to a number from musical theater, my ears bleed. The worst thing is when the musical song is a cover of proper music, but sung and enunciated in that simplistic, musical theater manner. Argh.

What is S-tier or a god roll for one player may not mesh well with my particular setup or play style.

One-shotting campers with my bolt-action rifle while running across open spaces was my daily bread. But then I grew older and my reflexes got worse. The only FPSs I play these days are offline, and ones not actually requiring perfect aim. The Borderlands series with all its offshoots is one of the greatests things to have ever happened to the gaming world, IMO (my opinions are never H). I did play Destiny I and II, but only the PvE content, really. I tried PvP but it was a humiIiating experience I regret not being able to forget :D.\n\nI have always been terrible at platformers, even back in the Atari era, when most games were of the genre.\n\nMy fave kind of game is an open world adventure, preferably in a historical context. Assassins Creed: Odyssey was heaven to me. To travel across ancient Greece of the classical era? Life doesn't get any better (although the fantasy and ahistorical elements of the environment were a bit jarring). I also loved Witcher III and Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt make such deep games! Playing them is so much more rewarding than reading a book or watching a movie. And the Uncharted series - so much fun, such great character arcs, especially in the second installment. TLoU, awsome. I never watched the series, fearing it would spoil my memories of the the game. I also never played TLoU 2, after the first trailer put me off with it sadism.","createDate":"1763652475","updateDate":"1763674276","approveDate":"1763652475","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146774852,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146775468","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.43951210379600525}

Likr the BL franchise a lot (so much zany humor!) but haven't jumped into 4 yet.  Like you, enjoyed TLOU 1, mainly for the story arc (not necessarily the combat which I always found a little clunky).  But also never played TLOU 2.  Very much enjoyed the Uncharted series too.  I will add that I thought, with a few notable exceptions, the TV adaptation of TLOU was well done and pretty faithful to the game.\n\nI also am almost exclusively a PVE player in FPS, I don't enjoy PVP and am not very good at it.  I normally won't play PVP unless there is a particular reward I really want that is tied to PVP.\n\nI am not a great platform gamer either but I found both Ori games to be fantastic, and although challenging  on normal difficulty, still manageable with patience and persistence.  FWIW I thought they succeeded with so many elements, the art style, physics of movement, gameplay and combat, puzzle solving, music, and engaging and emotional story.

I could be wrong, but you seem level-headed and not easily swayed by the latest garbage fed to us. Thusly, my opinion follows:\n\nAI, per se, has become more of a household term for “software-assisted,” which has been going on for quite some time now. Adam admitted to using ChatGPT solely for the 3-letter names, not for the entire puzzle. Maybe he went beyond, maybe he didn't. I don't care, it's not my point here.\n\nWe (stupid Americans) get bombarded with so many distractions, it’s becoming hard to know what is real and what isn't. A quick tech-industry example is the term “cloud.” It was used in the tech industry forever until it was sold to the general public as spiffy neato thingy to sell on-line storage (and other crap). Now, it's perfectly acceptable. (Gulp) There are many other exampless, but not enough space for it here.\n\nI'm not in support if AI, as it's currently being marketed to the young generation as “the latest thing.” I have no regard for Oprah’s “don’t be skeered,” nonsense, and god knows Oprah knows it all. I mistrust any retail or service industry that mines our online activity for their own profit. And what we now know as, AI, has been doing that all along.\n\nNext time you talk to your financial advisor, ask how your portfolio is being managed, and dare to mention AI. Their conditioned response of denial is laughable.\n\nThanks for tolerating my mini-rant.","createDate":"1763676807","updateDate":"1763698055","approveDate":"1763676809","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146778437,"parentUserDisplayName":"D","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146785753","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6002803444862366}

What is more time consuming (unless you use an algorithm) is finding possible crossword answers that have one of those names hidden every-other-letter in odd-indexed letter positions. Why on earth would anyone spend hours, days, weeks trying to think up good possibilities when a computer can spit out in a few seconds a more comprehensive list than you could probably think up in a year?

These centers use up so much water and electricity that it strains power grids (already outdated infrastructure), hikes electricity bills, and turns local water brown, or uses it up completely.

Data centers are definitely a resource hog, agreed. The process to obtain permits, though, has to pass the local commissioners and gain the utility companies' approval. We had a similar instance here, and the county commissioners denied the conversion of an empty warehouse into a data center.\nHow would industrial power consumption of any kind drive up consumer bills?
