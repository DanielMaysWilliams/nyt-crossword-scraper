On Monday, we had the Cy Young award, which honors the best pitcher in each league, and is named for an early pitcher who set a seemingly unbreakable record for wins (511) in an era when pitchers routinely made around 45 starts a year (and pitched complete games almost all the time).  (He also had 315 losses.)\n\nThat record is unlikely to ever be broken, because pitchers make, at the most, around 32 starts, assuming no injuries, and rarely pitch complete games, which further reduces win totals (some of the wins go to a relief pitcher).  Young also pitched for 22 seasons, which is close to the upper limit for the sport.\n\nThat same puzzle also had AT BAT, which, as one word, is a noun meaning, more or less, a turn at bat resulting in an out or a hit.\n\nYesterday's puzzle had STEALS HOME, which is a rare play that happens when the runner on third base scores on a stolen base.  This is often part of a double steal, when a runner on first base runs and draws the throw, and the runner on third tries to score before the ball can be thrown back home.  A straight steal of home--that is, with no other action on the same play--is exceedingly rare and very exciting.\n\nToday, we have the WORLD SERIES, which is the championship of...North America.  Or more exactly, the US and Toronto.  And starting Friday, we'll have it IRL.  \n\nThis public service announcement for all the unsportsed and non-Americans out there.","createDate":"1761104498","updateDate":"1761198022","approveDate":"1761104499","recommendations":27,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146103683","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6629092693328857}

But so does three, for that matter.  If your native languages are Indo-European, numbering in Japanese may feel wonderfully unfamiliar. If you ever need your brain rewired, I‚Äôd encourage studying Japanese.)\n\nAbove I‚Äôve written those three numbers in hiragana‚Äîone of Japan‚Äôs two phonetic syllabaries. In real use, numbers are usually written either in the logographic script kanji, ‰∏Ä, ‰∫å, ‰∏â, or in Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals, 1, 2, 3. Both sidestep the issue of varying pronunciations. (For completeness, in katakana they‚Äôd be „Ç§„ÉÅ, „Éã, „Çµ„É≥.)\n\nThen there are small kana, which modify the sound of the kana before them: „Å≤ is hi and „ÇÑ is ya, so „Å≤„ÇÉ is hya. (Likewise: „Å≤„Çá = hyo, „Å≤„ÇÖ = hyu.)\n\nWhich all got me thinking: _does Japan have crosswords? *HOW DO THEY WORK!??*_\n\nSo now I‚Äôve spent an hour down a rabbit hole of Japanese crosswords. Maybe one night your fianc√©e threw a toothbrush at you when you insisted Magic Johnson‚Äôs real first name‚Äîsix letters‚Äîwas EARWIG; but crosswords contribute to global understanding, and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise!!","createDate":"1761107513","updateDate":"1761205562","approveDate":"1761107515","recommendations":16,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146103875","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7917842864990234}

These are NOT homonyms or homophones, which are words spelled differently but pronounced the same (which is also a common crossword theme). That kind of thing is often problematic because words can sound very different depending on accent, region, etc. it‚Äôs always an issue when connections uses homophones (same as homonyms) because not everyone pronounces those words the same way. \n\nHomographs (which I had to look up) are words that are spelled the same but have different meanings. They can be pronounced differently, but do not have to be. Heteronyms (a subset of honographs) are words that are spelled the same but have different pronunciations AND different meanings. For example (and I choose this example just for you üòâ), Polish and polish are heteronyms. At the beginning of a sentence they would both be capitalized, so you would need context to distinguish them.\n\nAll of the theme entry beginnings were the *correctly spelled* words for those numbers in the indicated language. Pronunciation is immaterial for this puzzle, you just have to recognize that DOS, FIRE, OTTO, and SEIZE are the words for 2,4,8,16 in other languages.","createDate":"1761146105","updateDate":"1761178603","approveDate":"1761146106","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146107856,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146114738","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4991728663444519}
