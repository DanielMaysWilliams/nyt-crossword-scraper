That kind of thing is pretty tiring.  \n\nFor these reasons, I agree with Barry on checking first for those things that can be easily looked up...  I've occasionally run across a thing that I thought couldn't possibly be correct, but I would never just pop it into the comments until I check and every single time so far, it's been valid and it was just the thing I didn't know. I would not want to be the person who assumed I had to be correct over the maker and all the editors of the puzzle. Of course none of that is to say they can't and haven't made mistakes.
