Rather than presenting it in their theatre, they use spaces at The American Irish Historical Society.  The audience is seated at the table with the cast, a full meal is served, there's dancing... that's the immersive kind of dinner theatre. \n\nDinner theatre more broadly (also called Beef and Boards, perhaps a bit pejoratively) does indeed involve dinner and a show. I only worked in one, and it was a partially-union operation. Shows tended to be comedies and/or musicals (as opposed to The Dead, which is fairly heavy). Usually dinner precedes the show, and dessert is served at intermission. \n\nI just checked the AEA website and it looks like the agreement is still in effect:\n\n<a href=\"https://actorsequity.org/resources/contracts/dinner-theatre\" target=\"_blank\">https://actorsequity.org/resources/contracts/dinner-theatre</a>/","createDate":"1738952085","updateDate":"1738968416","approveDate":"1738952087","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139605093,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139612546","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7343513369560242}

Because he was stigmatized because he was born to an unwed mother and was considered illegitimate, he was more comfortable spending time with the former slaves than with fellow whites. Harris became a highly respected journalist, working for some major newspapers in the South, and contributing articles and commentary to various national publications.\n\nThe Uncle Remus stories are some of those collected folk tales as if retold by a black former slave, and have been considered a positive addition to African-American history, and worth preservation.\n\nMost of the controversy about the Uncle Remus stories arose because of the way Uncle Remus was portrayed in the Disney movie, \"Song of the South\". While typical for the time (1946), the dialogue and speech mannerisms were later considered to be inappropriately stereotypical and somewhat racist.\n\n\"Song of the South\" had its last theatrical release in 1986 for its 40th anniversary and has been held by Disney since. It has never been released for home video or streaming.","createDate":"1738981326","updateDate":"1739006230","approveDate":"1738981326","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139621793,"parentUserDisplayName":"Margrethe","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139622576","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7950830459594727}
