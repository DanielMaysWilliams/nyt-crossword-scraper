I really liked the clueing - it felt fresh. Some of it defeated me, sure, but that's to be expected from time to time, especially later in the week, given I'm Polish.\n\nThe NW quadrant of the puzzle was impossible for me. PAULA and ADA were my only gimmes rhere. For most of the other clues I needed lookups and even some reveals, in the end.\n\nI've never heard of a DOPE SLAP or of SLYBOOTS.\n\nThe clue for OCTET was good, but I just couldn't get it. \n\nI suppose I've heard of STUDY DATEs in American films and TV (I personally never had a single study date, and learning together just generally was not a thing when I was at school), but today I couldn't recall it even with just the T missing...\n\nThe clue for DISC stumped me. The thing is, we have the word \"dysk\" (disk/disc) in Polish, which means generally the same as in English. However, in geometry specifically, we call the region of a plane bounded by a circle not a \"dysk\" but a \"koło,\" which is also our word for wheel. I ended up looking up the answer 🤷\n\nIn the very middle of the puzzle I was confused by SKIN TAG. I googled what it is just now. Oh, those! I have no idea if the thing even has a Polish name (an article on it in Polish, as well as Dutch, is missing on Wikipedia).\n\nI wonder why ALDI, specifically, of all German and European supermarkets, made it on the American market. In Europe Lidl seems to be the most successful chain, and it's my personal favorite.","createDate":"1753420478","updateDate":"1753502097","approveDate":"1753420479","recommendations":40,"replyCount":19,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143795235","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7650222182273865}

More likely, the \"tee\" that begins the word teetotal is a reduplication of the letter \"t\" that begins total, emphasizing that one has pledged total abstinence. In the early 1800s, tee-total and tee-totally were used to intensify total and totally, much the way we now might say, \"I'm tired with a capital T.\" \"I am now … wholly, solely, and teetotally absorbed in Wayne's business,\" wrote the folklorist Parson Weems in an 1807 letter.

I didn’t find anything (neither one even lists it), but I did find an interesting word history for “dope”:\n\nThe word dope originated in American English and is a borrowing of the Dutch word doop, “sauce.” (New York City was once a Dutch colony, New Amsterdam, and many words originally distinctive to American English, like boss and cookie, were borrowed from Dutch colonists in the region.) Throughout the 1800s, dope meant “gravy,” and in the North Midland United States, particularly Ohio, dope is still heard as the term for a topping for ice cream, such as chocolate syrup or fruit sauce. Also in the 1800s, the meaning of dope was extended to include various medicinal mixtures or syrups, including the syrups from which soda-fountain drinks like Coca-Cola were prepared. A continuation of this usage survives in the South, particularly in South Carolina, where dope refers to the carbonated soft drink that elsewhere in the United States is called cola. Dope was especially used of those medicinal preparations that produced a stupefying effect, and it even became a slang term for the dark, molasses-like form of opium that was smoked in opium dens. The common modern meanings of dope, “a narcotic substance” and “narcotics considered as a group,” developed from this use of the word.","createDate":"1753432815","updateDate":"1753501716","approveDate":"1753432817","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143795852,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143796025","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7979571223258972}
