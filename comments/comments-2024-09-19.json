Sadly, even though the FDA was established in 1906, it didn't get authority to regulate such things until decades later. Some shoe store x-ray machines were still in use until the 1950s.

This is called a \"rebus.\" Almost impossible to know unless you have been instructed.  This is what you do: \n1. Click on the square (box) you want to fill, just to highlight it.\n2. Then click on the word \"Rebus,\" which online appears above the lists of clues.  On a phone app, it may be somewhere else.\n3. Go back to the square you want to fill, and you should now be able to type in as many characters/words in that one square as you want.\n4. Then click on any other square (or perhaps anywhere else on the puzzle -- I just always click on a new square).  Look back at the square that you filled with multiple characters.  You should now be able to see all the characters/words that you entered in your rebus square, in teeny tiny print!  If the words you entered in the square are very long, you may only see some of the letters, but if you click on the square again, you should be able to see all of them, and edit it them too.\n\nI hope this is clear and helpful.
