This one was just so much fun to work out.  I had paDS before BEDS, SHave before SHEAR, and caNS before TINS, but it was the 2 empty boxes at the end that I feared would bring me down.  _OOM ROASTED, _AI_S, BE_CH had me trying out many letter combinations in my head for quite a few minutes and I think it was pure intuition that delivered the correct letters, because I was completely unfamiliar with all three.  \n\nSurprising myself, I got HAD NO OOMPH with only the first H and the P in place, but the brilliant clue for GERALD tied me in knots for a while.  Garrett and Andrew do great work together, and their sense of humor permeates throughout this wonderful puzzle.","createDate":"1713608996","updateDate":"1713627862","approveDate":"1713608998","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132671322","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9427874684333801}

Don't recall) backstage at Ford Auditorium in hometown Detroit. I was in the habit of trying to get autographs of pianists and conductors at concerts when growing up, and my parents indulged me. My older sister had a crush on Seiji Ozawa and I guess by association I kinda got a crush too. For her I think it was partly his Beatles haircut at the time. But he was a brilliant conductor, brilliant.\n\nI also got signed programs from pianist André Watts, maybe a few others… Later, in college, I got Gene Roddenberry's autograph on a paper plate at a publicity event, he wrote \"Long Live and Prosper\" (almost right). Later as an adult I got 🎸Robyn Hitchcock's autograph on a clothes-hanger (I thought it a suitably quirky thing to sign). At a later Ann Arbor show I think I got his whole band's autographs, after four-handed jamming with bassist Andy Metcalfe at the Blind Pig's bar-area piano. *Ana Gasteyer voice* Good times...\n\nI don't know all the Shakespeare plays by any means, zilch about the historical plays & lots of gaps, but Twelfth Night>","createDate":"1713660368","updateDate":"1713721674","approveDate":"1713660371","recommendations":3,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132685424","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6928552389144897}

But these rebused-in multiple letters throw me off less than even a 'penciled'-in single letter because the multi letters are inherently uncertain-looking and don't tend to throw me off too badly.
