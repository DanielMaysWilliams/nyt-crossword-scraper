My only real stumble was mopup for sponge instead of MOOCH, but I was able to sort that out in a reasonable time.\n\nI did like seeing virtuoso banjo player (banjoist?) Bela Fleck make an appearance in the clues. Although a master of traditional bluegrass music, he has done much to make the banjo an instrument that’s comfortable in a variety of musical settings from African music to jazz and everything in between.  His album with Chick Corea features spectacular playing by both of them.  His wife, Abigail Washburn, is an accomplished banjo player too. Proving that opposites attract, he most often plays in the three finger picking style popularized by Earl Scruggs, while she plays the older clawhammer style.
