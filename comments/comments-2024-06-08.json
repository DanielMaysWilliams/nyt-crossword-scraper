I briefly wondered if it was one of the TRAPS just because I don't think I often see words repeated... I felt pretty sure of everything else, so I ended up consulting the key—alas, it wasn't completely look-up free. I had GEe instead of GEN, thus eFT instead of NFT. \n\nThe north and mid west came rather easily but the south and mid east were very hard. For a while down there, I was only confident of DEPP and MEN. Loads throughout that I put in and took out when they didn't serve me well on the crossings, especially Quito instead of SANA'A. That came out pretty quickly. My geography game continues to serve me well though. Before it, I'd have not heard of SANA'A. \n\n*Rickshaw was a big part of my downfall yesterday. I completed most of the puzzle on my own but I couldn't bring the NW home. Having rickshaw instead of MINE CART didn't help. I've watched all the Indy movies but I can't keep 'em straight. And I didn't know the proper pronouns up there and after putting it down and coming back many times, that area still remained a mystery so I had to do four lookups up there! \n\nI'll be 1 crosswording year old in Aug. I hope I can get a completely lookup/help free Saturday by then! 🤞","createDate":"1717877743","updateDate":"1718027666","approveDate":"1717877746","recommendations":6,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133782171","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7907378673553467}

For a themeless puzzle, you’d typically design a grid and stick in one or two “seed” entries — longer entries that you think are fun or that can be clued well. After that, it’s a matter of seeing what the software offers up as possible fill and choosing what you like best. (The constructor’s wordlist will determine what the potential fill is.)\n\nI’ve been unsatisfied with my attempts to make themeless puzzles because at some point in the process, the grid either becomes unfillable or can only be filled using some word that I really don’t want to use. So I marvel at grids like this one that are free of junky entries. \n\nIf you’re at all interested in puzzle construction, read the series of NYT articles that’s often linked at the bottom of the Wordplay column. There are several free, web-based construction applications. I have used Crosserville and in some ways prefer it to the program that I bought. \n\nThanks to the software, it’s not hard to construct a crossword puzzle. But it is challenging to make one that’s fun, interesting and publishable.","createDate":"1717841983","updateDate":"1718801180","approveDate":"1717841985","recommendations":24,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133771952,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rod D","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133772183","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.779954195022583}

All three answers of the upper stack are NYT debut answers, and of the bottom stack, one is a debut (PUT ON THE RITZ), and the other two have only appeared in the Times puzzle once.\n\nI don’t know about you, but fresh answers like this delight my brain, giving it new riddles to crack, including clues it has never seen.  My brain comes to crosswords hungering to figure things out.  It likes riddle-cracking so much more than simply recalling clues and answers it’s seen before.\n\nSpeaking of freshness, Daniel put in new and terrific clues for a couple of answers that have appeared numerous times – [Ventilator settings, for short] for ERS, and [Booker’s workplace?] for SENATE.  \n\nI do like how TRAP DOOR goes downward.  And BROWNIE BATTER, well, when I look at that answer, I can just smell the dough as if it is actually under my nose, and, to me, it’s one of those life-enriching smells, like fresh-baked bread.\n\nSo, Daniel, you’ve happified my brain and mood with your lovely puzzle.
