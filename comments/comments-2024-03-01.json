I loved all the parallel clues and entries: in addition to the ones Deb mentioned, there was INSTA/KILO, and OBIT/OP-EDS. Am I missing any?\n\nA musician by avocation, if not vocation, I, too, fell for the RAp/pOSEE trap, even though I felt uncomfortable with it. Raps, like most current popular music genres, are predominantly in duple meter (beats in multiples of two), they are usually notated in 4/4, also called \"common time,\" and abbreviated as \"C\"*. Also, even though many raps have tuneful hooks or refrains--I recently linked a video of a rap by Eminem, which featured a lovely refrain by Dido--the whole idea of \"rap\" is rhythmic spoken word, not tuneful melody.\n\nAnd \"(Une) Posée\" seemed a possible, if unlikely modeling term.\n\nBut that wasn't the right answer. Here's Thomas Wilson performing a useful task, for the [benefit] of the Chamber Orchestra of the Springs, in a little Expensive Noise in 2/4, by Scott Joplin: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgxgqXGjFsg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgxgqXGjFsg</a>\n\nBut not all rags are in 2/4--here's the great jazz pianist, Johnny Guarnieri, adding a beat (or three) in an unconventional take on the Maple Leaf Rag (the video was excerpted from one with a lengthy spoken intro; but who's that guy who edited himself in on the drum kit?): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Di1Flrgq2E&t=39s\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Di1Flrgq2E&t=39s</a>\n\n*I could give a lengthy musicological explanation why \"C\" is *not* an abbreviation for \"Common time.\" Maybe David will do it for me.","createDate":"1709300211","updateDate":"1709345399","approveDate":"1709300214","recommendations":11,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131535861","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8488771319389343}

Each screening of Eno is unique, presenting different scenes, order, music, and meant to be experienced live. The generative and infinitely iterative quality of \"Eno\" poetically resonates with the artist’s own creative practice, his methods of using technology to compose music, and his endless deep dive into the mercurial essence of creativity.\"","createDate":"1709328073","updateDate":"1709357992","approveDate":"1709328076","recommendations":6,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131548027","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6703372597694397}
