You have season tickets to the finest opera house in the world, which on weekends routinely provides the best performances with complex themes, bold staging of classics and the newest avante garde masterpieces. During the week they provide lighter, shorter productions for families or those new to opera—which you don’t mind, it can be a nice diversion and in any case you hope will create an even greater interest and market for something you love.\n\nGradually, though, you notice the quality of the weekend operas goes down. Maybe they only show more mainstream operas that everyone is familiar with, with oversimplified staging, translated into English, cut so they are not as long, or start spending less on stars or production values. You suspect it’s because the demand for opera is going down and they are trying to sell more to the general public.\n(Continued in next post)","createDate":"1771595607","updateDate":"1771639028","approveDate":"1771595608","recommendations":21,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149021247","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5995152592658997}

And, to be honest, you die a little bit every time you leave the theater and hear people who are not as passionate about opera as you say “I loved this—it’s so fun and easy to understand—I’m so glad they got rid of those stuffy, tedious shows they were putting on.” You don’t have anything against those folks—real opera isn’t for everyone—but you wonder why your experience needs to be diminished to cater to them. \n\nPerhaps all this is just inevitable as tastes and culture change. And eventually, I suppose, the old timers will find acceptance in the new state of events or stop buying tickets. But you wish the theatre at least would be up front when they sell subscriptions that they are deliberately changing the level of their productions to appeal to the general public so you can make an informed decision, and admit that they are no longer the most elite and discerning opera house. And you wish that there were another opera house you could go to that maintained the original standards (which so far as I know doesn’t exist in the crossword world—or if so please tell me). \nDoes that make sense?

It occurred to me that the people with the fastest solving times would be making comments sooner than those who struggle more. Also, those who are more serious about solving the puzzles are likely to start the puzzle earlier. Two hypotheses which, if correct, would cause there to be fewer complaints about the puzzle being too easy as it gets later in the day. I didn't get a chance to check this out but it should be easy to get an idea of the trend using a simple visual method. I'd be inclined to simply make a list of the attitudes of the commentors over time. Something like EENENNDENN, where E is a mention of the puzzle being Easy, D a mention of Difficult, and N indicates the comment was Neutral or made No mention of difficulty.  Regardless, people who comment close together in time are likely to be more alike in ability and opinion of a puzzle than those making comments further apart.\n\nAnother thought about the comments was about those who compared recent puzzles to ones published several years ago. There are a few reasons the old puzzles may seem harder including changes in how words are used and commonly known trivia, as well as a learning curve for those who have been solving for a number of years. But there are also good reasons why the Times may be trying to make the puzzle accessible to more people as they rely on puzzles to help maintain profitability.\n\nJust some thoughts.","createDate":"1771579984","updateDate":"1771646061","approveDate":"1771579986","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":149016766,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mishlev","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149017460","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7600682377815247}

As I'm gaining expertise in solving these puzzles, my time is improving for those older puzzles.

I really appreciate your taking the time to write out your thoughts on the ongoing dumbing-down of the phenomenon/institution that has been the Shortz-era NYT crossword puzzle, especially as a “regular” who is known to be a published constructor (in contrast to my own manner of engaging this forum, as reflected by my current handle).\n\nFurthermore, I think your analogy is very apt — though, as someone who also doesn’t really like opera, but loves classical music, I would have formulated it in terms of a symphony orchestra that gradually replaces the “masterworks” repertoire with “pops” concerts (e.g. Disney classics, broadway tunes, etc).\n\nTo extend the analogy: lots of people who don’t particularly like classical music still enjoy getting dressed up and attending orchestra performances for date nights. They do this in large part because they perceive these events as carrying a certain cultural cachet, which fundamentally derives from the deeply held affection of symphony-goers who *do* appreciate the works.\n\nBut, while a given symphony orchestra could potentially juice their revenues in the short term by going heavy on “pops”, this would inevitably erode the very cachet that attracts the date-night crowd to “the symphony” in the first place.\n\nAnd so it is with the idea of a “Saturday NYT puzzle”, or a “tricky Thursday”.

Do puzzles from 10-20 years ago and this will be painfully obvious—and this is apart from differences in cultural references with time (which for me should be easier as you go farther back).\n\n2) I like musical theater more than opera too, but it’s a different genre—if you are changing the format of your opera house to musical theater you should let people know before you sell season tickets. And as for newer styles, newer compositions, newer production techniques—that’s part of being an elite opera house and we welcome that. In fact, part of the complaints I  have is that the Times seems to be repeating versions of tired themes and clues instead of stretching the limits of what crosswords can do and be about. I submitted a puzzle recently with entries that extended out of the grid. This is literally what they wrote in the rejection: “Also, we're trying not to run many puzzles with letters hanging outside the grid that often, as they tend to be harder to see and solve.” So that pretty much sums it up.","createDate":"1771600786","updateDate":"1771630131","approveDate":"1771600787","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":149022193,"parentUserDisplayName":"SP","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149024778","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6821238398551941}

I think it illustrates perfectly the frustration that many long-time customers feel when puzzles that used to be a challenging endeavor, one that tested them to their very limits and made them better solvers, no longer do so. \n\nI get the complaints of other solvers who are understandably excited to be finally making it through the later week puzzles with no help or lookups, only to have their accomplishments denigrated by remarks that “the puzzles are easier now.” Who wouldn’t be disappointed by that? \n\nAt the same time, I’ve come to believe that there really has been a change in cluing over time. I admit I was skeptical of that argument, made by commenters who urged people to try the Archives and see what they think. \n\nWell, I finally did, going into ones from before June 2014, when I started solving online.  And they are devilish by comparison to today. Not with arcane trivia and obscure pop culture, but with non-obvious clues.  \n\nAnd I found my solving experience for those to be more rewarding. It took longer, of course, but figuring out what was behind the meaning of the clues and seeing the puzzle slowly, slowly unfold before me, chipping away one square at a time until, lo and behold, it’s all filled in. And it all makes sense! There’s nothing like that moment of accomplishment and knowing that you wrestled with a seemingly unsolvable problem and figured it out. All by yourself.
