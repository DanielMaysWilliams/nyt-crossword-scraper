Some like to phrase that perception as a complaint (\"too easy/hard for a [insert day of the week]\".  I think despite the editors best efforts you will frequently have puzzles that fall out of range of a given day's average.  \n\nGiven the diversity of solvers. It is not surprising that folks relative solving difficulty is all over the place.  It is fun to see how one's solving difficulty stacks up against the rest of the solvers, but to complain about it seems like wasted effort.  It is the nature of the beast for it to be that way.  Even if the NYT suddenly has the resources to increase the number of puzzle testers to help gauge what day of the week a puzzle should fall, I would imagine the results would not be much different.  \n\nEnjoy the puzzle one is given, and if it seems harder than average, know that it won't be long before an easier than average puzzle comes along.","createDate":"1738245807","updateDate":"1738291164","approveDate":"1738245808","recommendations":30,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139370210","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5127696990966797}

At first I thought it was a similar trick to yesterday because I knew it had to be heart transplant but it didn't fit. I tried HEARTTRANS, which fit and made me think the trick was that there would be a missing word at the end of each theme clue or some such. The crossers disabused me of that idea and I eventually got to the revealer, which opened up the rest. It was a nice aha moment when UPSANDDOWNS clicked and I realized the circles had to be significant. I'm sure more seasoned cruciverbalists saw it a lot sooner though, judging from the significant number of 'easy for a Thursday' comments.\n\nNOTES: \n‚Ä¢ Sad to say I originally put STEVIE for 1D, which worked with EST and encouraged me to follow the trail to a dead end before remembering that it was an ARETHA album, which I have listened to many times (sigh).\n \n‚Ä¢ I truly don't know if I could have completed the puzzle without 26D. It was almost the only longer clue that I knew for certain and it really helped anchor the entire center. I can understand why anyone unfamiliar with Harry Potter would have struggled that section.

In baseball, ONE ON means one man on base.  One of the three bases other than home has a runner on it.\n\nThe term \"leadoff\" means the first batter up in an inning.  Anytime the leadoff batter makes it on base in any way, that's a ONE ON situation for the next batter.\n\nA walk is a free pass to first base, earned by letting four pitches that are out of the strike zone go by without attempting to hit them.  \n\nThe strike zone is the imaginary area that is over home plate (home base) and covering a vertical area best described by the drawing here:\n\n<a href=\"https://businessinsider.com/mlb-strike-zone-2014-9\" target=\"_blank\">https://businessinsider.com/mlb-strike-zone-2014-9</a>\n\nThus, when a leadoff batter gets a walk, there's ONE ON.\n\nAny questions?","createDate":"1738242054","updateDate":"1738282135","approveDate":"1738242055","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139367408,"parentUserDisplayName":"Tim Shaindlin","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139368907","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-30","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9161821007728577}

Yesterday's clue felt to me that it had a very obvious direction with at least ten equally possible answers. Literally randomly choose a sports team from California. That's why I said it had no possibility of validating the solver's intelligence; there was no intelligence involved other than knowing some sports teams and then choosing one at random. It feels like the wrong kind of trivia, or at least a lazy kind. Who am I to say it's not perfectly valid? Agreed. There are no rules outside of established NYT Crossword norms and it is ipso facto perfectly valid. It just felt kinda bad. Today's clue at least had the chance of making the solver feel clever. I think RAKE is a great answer. And I bet it made you feel superior to the constructor, if slightly disappointed. I went with RAZE right away because I already had AZKABAN and it felt good to plug it in knowing that I had done some lateral thinking and gotten it right.\n\nAnyway. I think everything to death so hopefully it doesn't feel like I'm bludgeoning you with this overcooked justificatory screed. I appreciate that you pushed back.
