There was so much I just did not know 1500 characters will not be enough to describe it all so I won't even try - I'll just give examples. Also, I never seem to be on the wavelength of this particular constructor. On my first across pass I solved 4 clues, and one answer was wrong (Enya over BONO).\n\nAMSCRAY... That's pig Latin, is it? I have seen that word in NYT puzzles before, I think, but it just looks so random to me I don't believe I will ever be able to remember it.\n\nHistorically, a bacchanal was so much more than just a BENDER! Sure, bacchanals may have been fueled by wine (wine isn't your typical BENDER drink of choice, is it?), but they were mystical rites, all about freedom from society's rules, especially for women, dancing wildly and making love out of the city, in the domain of nature. There is something depressingly primitive about equating a bacchanal with a bender.\n\nWhy clue FRAU as \"Swiss Ms.\"? \"Fräulein\" is considered dated these days, as it defines women by their marital status (married: Frau; unmarried: Fräulein). Can't simply Frau, the currently marital-neutral default for politely addressing a woman, have been clued? Also, I don't think Germans, also Swiss German speakers, shorten words the way Americans do, so \"Fräu.\" for Fräulein is probably not even a thing.\n\nI could go on, listing the dozen or more entries I ended up revealing... \n\nNot my day, fill-wise.

I figured I was on the right wavelength when I filled in AMSCRAY without hesitation, and immediately saw several of the Downs from that starting point. For anyone who hated that clue and answer, consider that they have the perfect pairing of tone and level of colloquial humor that makes it a great late-week clue.\n\nIt took just a few crosses to come up with KIPLING, which always brings to mind that classic cartoon:\n\nDo you like KIPLING?\n I don't know, you naughty boy, I've never kippled.\n\nJust so much to like in this one, but especially the starred clues and answers. I didn't cotton onto the special treatment of the letter T. I just assumed the T's were in the black squares, but imagine how hard it must have been to construct a puzzle and avoid the most frequently used consonant.\n\nAlso, Deb, thanks for the reminder of Amy's heartbreaking talent. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AL-nv-7TIws?si=c9qzaTzq67p3k3Qz\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/AL-nv-7TIws?si=c9qzaTzq67p3k3Qz</a>","createDate":"1748519013","updateDate":"1748570971","approveDate":"1748519015","recommendations":12,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142455582","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-29","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9206255078315735}

After solving, I like to look the puzzle over and hope to be wowed by what it took to pull it together.\n\nI got all that today.  The art and the science.\n\nRiddles?  Plenty of no-knows and vague clues to provide my brain with a happy feast of labor.  \n\nEntertainment?  Plenty of wordplay in the cluing; I especially liked the original and devilish [Stage props?] for HAND.  Also, spread throughout was beauty in answer, which makes my heart happy: LADYBUG, ENAMOR, VELVET, FULL DIVA, BEAGLE, LUCHADORA.  \n\nIf a puzzle can make my brain sweat as well as my heart smile, it is one of the special ones.\n\nVery impressive skill in the build.  Getting those T’s where they had to be, making the rows where the T’s are missing consist of bona-fide words, and getting theme answers that fit symmetry requirements – wow!\n\nColor me happy, satisfied, and impressed.

Took me more than 30 minutes, but I got it solved without assistance. Definitely hampered me that TEASEUP was unknown to me.

Also helped that I remembered Sacco and Vanzetti, though NICOLA I got mostly from the crosses.\n\nAlmost nothing in this grid was CRINGEY. Even some of the GLUE here was interesting, like the quartet of AYE, YEA, YEP and EYE. \n\n\"Female in Mexican-style wrestling\" still means nothing to me, though I got LUCHADORA easily enough.\n\nLiked the \"French connection\" with ETVOILA crossing MOT.

I thought the gimmick wasn’t particularly tricky, but the cluing did seem more difficult than usual for a Thursday (for me anyway, which is not a bad thing). It definitely took me longer than average. At first I thought there were just missing letters in the black squares. I didn’t even notice that they were all Ts until pondering the revealer. When it came down to the end (NW corner for me), I could see that “CONSTELLATION” fit, and I couldn’t think of anything else that did, but while I’ve heard of the “smart people group”, I hadn’t ever heard of a constellation by that name before, so I was trying to think of something else that might work.\n\nI think I have Frank Burns (from M*A*S*H) to thank for knowing AMSCRAY 🤓. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the individual parts of the theme entries were all valid crossword entries on their own (including the unclued first parts: CONS, FLA, DEA).

As for the dot or lack thereof: in Polish, if an abbreviation ends on the same letter as the full word, there is no dot, so doktor Nowak becomes dr Nowak. If the final letter is different, a dot appears. With declension, \"Doctor Nowak's car\" becomes \"Samochód doktora Nowaka.\" Using abbreviations, a Polish person would style that as either \"Samochód dr.

It is, more often than not, a form of projection used to avoid dealing with logical argument. I read your article and there is nothing (at least in the evidence that is presented, assuming it's true) there to indicate the ability of man to become a woman and vice versa. Today's gender ideology cult points to none of the biological characteristics mentioned in the article and uses an individual's feelings as sole proof of their gender. The prefixing of \"CIS' to the word \"man\" (in my case) is detached from biological reality in that includes within a category (men) both actual men as well as people who are not men but think that they are.

It's more of a logical contradiction (which is worse) in that it tries to define a category while obliterating it's boundaries - the essence of the concept of a category.\n\nWhat is science-denying is pointing at a person who is obviously a man in a dress and insisting he is female because he is under the illusion that he is. This is actually worse than say, a flat-earther since the latter is making a false claim about reality based on what he cannot see (he's never been to space or travelled around the world and he doesn't watch ships' masts appearing on the horizon etc etc etc) while the former is pointing directly at a reality in front of him and saying it's false based on another person's interpretation.\n\nMy objection to the use of CIS (in the context of gender, not in the context of the former USSR) is that it is a slur meant to demean and exclude biological men and women from their genders by implying that their gender is meaningless and up for grabs to anyone wishing to adopt it. The vast majority of the world today and the entire world up until three seconds ago didn't accept the tenets of gender ideology which are themselves anti science and designed to break down the concept of scientific categories.
