My 2 cents: I thought the fill was pretty good. I think the constructor gets major style points (if not solving points) for coming up with interlaceable words that make other words (Python or not) and anyone complaining about the new words not being related is smoking something—how many words do you think you could do this with? On the other hand, the braids don’t add much to the solving experience, once you get the trick, which is pretty quickly once you get enough acrosses.

Think of embedded answers, for instance. 2) I enjoyed this even though I completely missed that the downs *as filled* were also coherent answers.

I don't feel like I have to be smarter than the constructor in order to be satisfied; in fact, I like it when I can marvel at the constructor's cleverness.

One side seemed to think the editors totally messed up as this is a unit of mass (many on this side perhaps suffered from Steve L’s TCS). The other side felt that in common usage we often order weights at the butcher shop, or bathroom scale weights, in kilograms. TONNES has appeared about 30 times or so, and almost half the time it has been clued as some kind of British “weight”. As Jo from DC correctly points out, TONNE is an equivalent of “metric ton” which in reality is a mass unit. The term on this side of the pond (“short or long ton”) usually (but not always) refers to a “weight”, while the avoir du pois  mass unit is a “slug”. ( I remember when someone in the March puzzle comments lamented the absence of “banana-grams” in it, I pointed out the U.S. version of that is the “banana slug”).","createDate":"1716470846","updateDate":"1716470848","approveDate":"1716470848","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133404858,"parentUserDisplayName":"Robert Ljungquist","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133406027","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6863623261451721}
