The English spelling is Olaf, which reflects the Old Norse version, √ìl√°fr. It could date as far back as 793 CE, the year the Vikings first raided Lindisfarne. By the time the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was compiled ca. 890, there would have been lots of Olafs running around the Danelaw. Now, the Chronicle spells it as Anlaf, which was probably how the Anglo-Saxons heard the Old East Norse variants of the name, √Åleifr or Anleifr, which in turn came from an earlier Proto-Norse root, reconstructed as *Anu-laibaraz‚Äîsomething like ‚Äúforefather‚Äôs heir.‚Äù \n\nBy the time the first Christian scribes in Scandinavia were transcribing runic texts in the 12th c. and writing down their oral sagas in the 13th c., √ìl√°fr was the more common version. It‚Äôs worth noting that the f in √ìl√°fr was probably pronounced as a /Œ≤/ in Old Norse, a kind of buzzing b (not quite an f or a v), and was probably allophonic, i.e. it didn‚Äôt contrast with another similar sound (like v), but showed up depending on environment. The modern spelling and pronunciation variants in today‚Äôs Scandinavian languages reflect how those old regionals spellings solidified differently: Norwegian Olav, Danish and Swedish Olaf, Icelandic √ìlafur (still faithfully retaining that -r masculine ending of Okd Norse), and Faroese Olavur. \n\nStill, for the record, the English spelling is Olaf. We wrote it down 3 centuries before the Scandinavians did.

Rowers, not motors. The Vogalonga started as a protest against the predominance of motorized boats, whose wakes weaken the foundations of Venice's buildings. The event has been credited with reviving the interest in Voga alla Veneta, the Venetian style of rowing, in which the oarsmen stand in a keel-less boat, the oar cradled (but not fixed) in a beautifully carved black walnut forcola. I kayaked the 40th Vogalonga in 2014, and have never experienced such a thrill as returning to the city amid cheers from the thousands of tourists lining the canals and watching from the bridges, and rowed the 45th Vogalonga in a Venetian sandolo with the Venetian guys who taught me how to row in the intervening years. I hope to participate in the 50th edition next year. The motoscafi, as pretty and well-maintained as they are, can't match the elegance of Venetian rowing craft, including the gondola, sandolo,  mascareta, caorlina, and other variants, as they glide soundlessly along the canals.","createDate":"1749487757","updateDate":"1749529218","approveDate":"1749487757","recommendations":17,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142715603","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7376033663749695}

The Jewish calendar is a mixed solar-lunar affair, with the months lining up with the moon's cycles but with a 19-year pattern of leap years in which an additional /month/ is intercalated six times. This makes up the difference between the 354+-day lunar year and the 365+-day solar year. If you want to see what happens without this smoothing out, watch the Islamic festivals move all the way through the solar seasons, being observed in summer, fall,  winter, and spring as the years pass.","createDate":"1749428774","updateDate":"1749488355","approveDate":"1749428774","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142696584,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rebecca Goldstein","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142697550","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9055737853050232}

As you can see (even if you can't pronounce it), they are quite similar.\n\nAlso, confusingly for speakers of other languages including English, the shortest way to actually utter \"yes\" in Polish is to say... \"no\" (that sounds different than the English \"no\", however, as our \"o\" is always like yours in otter or Ottawa; the \"o\" of your \"no\" we would write down as \"o≈Ç\" or \"ou\"). It is related to the Czech and Slovak \"ano\", their \"yes\".\n\nTeenagers are often rebuked by adults for substituting \"no\" for other, more polite and verbose ways of assenting.

The oldest written copy of The Song of Roland is from the 11th c., but it describes something that happened in the 8th c. in the Pyrenees‚Äîaway from any coastal Viking raids and thus contact with Old Norse speakers. Besides, Olivier is a fictional character; it‚Äôs unlikely that a French knight in shining French armor was named after an overheard name from among the people plundering the French land. \n\nI see another online folk etymology connecting French Olivier with Old English √Ülfhere.
