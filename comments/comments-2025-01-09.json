Give me a break.\n\nEven for the glue (of which there was plenty!) the cluing was subpar. An ALP is a [Challenge for a skier]? In what sense other than it’s a mountain? What else would one ski on? I’ve skied in the Alps and there are plenty of easy trails to choose from. How did that clue make it past the editors? It’s not even cute: it’s just wrong. \n\nA sparkling theme would have made up for the decidedly mediocre fill. But the execution was poor. ARTHUR ASHE is indeed a male, yes. But that hardly seems his defining characteristic. Similarly, one can serve GAZPACHO as a first course, but that’s true of many many foods.\n\nI understand that a clue is not a definition. But these are really terrible clues IMO. It was basically a thematic equivalent of green paint.

And I didn't realize that the official spelling was \"alfa,\" but learning it made it feel even more . . . wait, doesn't Juliette drive an Alfa Romeo?

SE corner was one of the worst offenders with WELCHS, WATUSI, TAUTEN. ICERAIN and ISON felt terrible- Never have I met someone who calls it ice rain instead of freezing rain or icy rain, and perhaps it's my inexperience, but I still have no clue how you get ISON from 55A instead of ISUP.\n\nI got the theme immediately, and actually enjoyed quite a few of the entries, though I do think it would've been much more satisfying if the NATO alphabet portion of the clue had more to do with the entry. CLYDESDALE, PANDA, and SERGIO set up expectations for the theme nicely. QUITO was one I frankly just didn't know, but otherwise same as above. I thought THIRTEEN was a bit lazy, and would've been a great opportunity to make TWENTY work instead. GAZPACHO is where it fell apart for me- getting that out of \"course\"is a stretch.\n\nThen we have ARTHURASHE, which is just unforgivable.

The only dictionary listed that I own in hard copy is an old (third edition, ©1996) AH Unabridged dictionary, and it lacks an entry for ICE RAIN. \n\nI conclude that Dictionary.com scrapes online sources for entries and is befuddled when a comma comes between two words. \n\nI concur that the answer is dicey.","createDate":"1736444028","updateDate":"1736497490","approveDate":"1736444033","recommendations":22,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138871210","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.657402753829956}
