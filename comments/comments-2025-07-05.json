I studied them for a long time, inspired by the very sad story of the fall of their empire and destruction of their culture at the hands of the cruel, avaricious and bigoted Spaniards (\"Let's torture, rob and klil these people for Jesus!\").

Both my parents being professors of it probably played a role, but now that I'm my own person I still study it as a hobby. It really teaches lessons - too bad most people ignore them. Also, I find stories of real people, their lives and their world more interesting and engaging than fiction.\n\nThere is also an element of nostalgia, of sorts, to learning about the past. So much has been lost: the stories of people's lives, the very ways in which they perceived the world, their art, their lore... It feels good to make a connection to those who came before by studying what they left behind, but there is always the accompanying sadness of realizing some things we will never know. This is really the only sort of romanticism not alien to me. This nostalgic element is probably the reason I find ancient history most interesting - it's the most unknowable.","createDate":"1751698389","updateDate":"1751777434","approveDate":"1751698391","recommendations":25,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143306935,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143307015","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7576552629470825}

Tried to connect the clue to the various other EDIEs who often appear in our puzzles.\n\nI don't think the constructor or editor who wrote the clue had any idea about the book.
