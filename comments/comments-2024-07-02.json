Many more experienced commenters pushed back (as usual) and said that the less experienced people most likely will learn to anticipate rebuses and eventually love them.  I pointed people to other outlets that never have rebuses, but didn't mention the New Yorker, because although I don't remember the last time there was a rebus, I noticed there was definitely a Rebus button on the main keyboard (not one hidden behind a More button).  I wondered if anyone found that positioning the Rebus button thusly would make a difference for newbies.\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that when I got to my final square, which was one of the rebuses, as soon as I entered one letter, I got the \"you're close\" message.  In other words, it required both letters (and I neglected to use the David Connell method of making sure my last entry was a non-rebus square).  So what do you think of requiring that the rebus be completed as intended, and not allowing just one letter?\n\nDiscuss amongst yourselves.","createDate":"1719924530","updateDate":"1720010431","approveDate":"1719924532","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134337857,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134338172","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7105321884155273}
