A bit more difficult that most Mondays, and I welcome that, so I thank the editors for placing Elliot Caroll's well-constructed puzzle here.\n\nPaul Simon is one of the great US songwriters, right alongside Frank Zappa and Bob Dylan. The greatest North American songwriter is Neil Young, and I have a special fondness for Leonard Cohen and Lou Reed.\n\nAlbert Brooks has created some excellent films. I enjoy his wry take on life, particularly in Modern Romance and Lost In America, which are two American classics. (I do wonder whether anyone has ever called him \"Al\" -- I haven't watched the documentary yet, so that might be a way to find out.) Plus, Brooks's brother, the late Bob Einstein, is one of the funniest guys ever, so I was happy to think about him as well, particularly his years on Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nWhy do some people still call aluminum foil \"tin foil\"? I have read any studies on this, but I suspect those people also say \"ink pen\" and perhaps even \"icebox\". If you say \"tin foil\" I'd be interested in a response, because my curiosity is now piqued.\n\nAlabama Slammers will remain a mystery to me. I gave up alcohol 5+ years ago, because it was enough already, but if I ever have a terminal disease, I will welcome bourbon back into what remains of my life.\n\nAnd now with YSSY playing in the background via Bandcamp, I'll continue through the rest of the NYT Monday puzzles.\n\nFor some reason Eric the Actor just popped into my head, so I'll say, \"Bye for now.\"","createDate":"1733743830","updateDate":"1733798749","approveDate":"1733743835","recommendations":13,"replyCount":14,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138141950","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-09","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.917924165725708}

I acknowledge and respect that others' lists will be different.\n\nJoni Mitchell is to me the greatest North American woman songwriter, and is indeed in my all-time top 10 list of great North American songwriters.\n\nAs to the narrow time band of my list, mentioned by @Steve L, that's the era that speaks to me, and also it stands my test of time. More recently -- starting about 10 years ago -- I have heard some pretty great stuff on Alt Nation. I remember when I discovered that channel on SiriusXM and said, \"Finally, modern music I enjoy.\" Maybe some of that music will stand my test of time.\n\nIn the 90s and forward my favorite songwriters off the top of my head are almost surely Guy Garvey--mostly of Elbow (and not North American, so I shouldn't even mention him, because that opens up a much broader spectrum for consideration) -- and John & John of They Might Be Giants.\n\nThe people who come to my mind as the great North American songwriters of today are Lady Gaga, Lana del Rey, and Billie Eilish. In fact, zero great men songwriters come to my mind in the current era.\n\nThanks for all the discussion about music and tinfoil, et al. \n\n@Shan: I remember that Napoleon Bonaparte III song without even clicking your link.
