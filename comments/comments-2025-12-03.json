But when they get their corners knocked off, they're no good any more... I don't think writers are sacred, but words are. They deserve respect. If you get the right ones in the right order, you can nudge the world a little or make a poem which children will speak for you when you're dead.”\n\nand two more of my favorites:\n\n“Life is a gamble, at terrible odds. If it were a bet you wouldn’t take it.”\n\n“Eternity is a terrible thought. I mean, where’s it going to end?”\n\nI’m just scratching the surface, I’ll let you discover more yourself if you haven’t already.

It's possible that the rivalry originated with the Toledo War of 1835, aka the Ohio–Michigan War, should you care to type an en-dash.\n\nThe C of M was founded in 1817 in Detroit by Fr. Gabriel Richard—I bike by the site every morning on my way to work—and only relocated to ANN Arbor in 1841. At its inception, the school was endowed with thirteen didaxiim, or fields of study: in Anthropoglossica, Mathematica, Physiognostica, Physiosophica, Astronomia, Chymia, Iatrica, Œconomica, Ethica, Polemitactica, Diëgetica, Ennœica, and Catholepistemia; and don't you dare split those digraphs!\n\nOne might argue that the rival of Michigan is Michigan. That is to say, between the (renamed) University of Michigan vs. Michigan State University. As a result, one has to be careful about one's terminology: U of M vs. MSU, Wolverine vs. Spartan, Ann Arbor vs. East Lansing, or simply \"Michigan\" vs. \"State.\" The rivalry is, in many ways, between Urban vs. Rural, Affluent vs. Salt-of-the-earth, Detroit metro vs. All the rest of Michigan; but, of course, this is a gross over-simplification.\n\n***\n\nHere's some sunny music, in a minor alternating with A major:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG33g_ELdeM&list=RDJG33g_ELdeM&start_radio=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG33g_ELdeM&list=RDJG33g_ELdeM&start_radio=1</a>","createDate":"1764763472","updateDate":"1764777317","approveDate":"1764763475","recommendations":11,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147025607","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6041215062141418}

One friend mentioned dates as a possibility.
