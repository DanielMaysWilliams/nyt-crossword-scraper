An RBI is a run batted in, a statistical category for batters in which the consequence of their turn at bat brings in a run.  This is usually a result of a runner or runners already on base scoring on a hit, but they may also score on an out, or various other ways. A batter also gets an RBI for scoring on his own hit when he hits a home run. \n\nWith a runner on third base, one possible option is to bunt (i.e. tap, not swing at) the ball, and hit the ball a short distance, forcing the first or third baseman to move in quickly to pick up the ball, by which time the runner on third can score unimpeded. \n\nThis is called a squeeze play. There are two types. The safety squeeze is when the runner on third base waits for the batter to bunt the ball successfully, and then dashes home. This requires a fast runner on third base. \n\nThe other type is the suicide squeeze. The runner on third breaks for home as the ball is pitched, and hopes the batter can make contact with the ball. If the batter does, then the runner at third is sure to score, more so than on a safety squeeze. On the other hand, if the batter can’t bunt the ball, the runner is a dead duck; hence the name. \n\nSince the runner is likely to be out on the play, squeeze plays normally happen with fewer than two outs. If it’s the bottom of the ninth (last chance up) in a tie game, that RBI could mean victory for the team at bat.","createDate":"1757039311","updateDate":"1757146781","approveDate":"1757039313","recommendations":44,"replyCount":25,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144771550","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9041147232055664}

Some amazing research on crows has been done by Professor Emeritus, John Marzluff, and his team at the University of Washington in Seattle.  See his books, including “In the Company of Crows and Ravens” for some fascinating reading.  There are a couple of huge crow roosts in the Seattle area.  I frequently visit the one at the University of Washington’s satellite campus in Bothell, about 20 miles northeast of Seattle.  As many as 14,000 crows commute from surrounding neighborhoods to the roost each night.  When I’m home, I watch for what I call the crow commute as daylight is coming to an end.  The crows in my neighborhood are winging their way to the Bothell roost, somewhat less than 20 miles as the crow flies. I don’t think many people look overhead and see that the crows are all flying in the same direction.  At the roost, they are all crowded together and they make a big racket as they arrive around sunset. Then, in the morning, they return to their own little plot in their own particular neighborhood and are very territorial.  City crows, who have abundant food, have pretty small territories.   The tales of their intelligence, alluded to in the clue, are wonderful.  “Crow Planet” by Lyanda Lynn Haupt, another local author, also provides an interesting look at these intelligent animals with whom we share our home.","createDate":"1757047298","updateDate":"1757152729","approveDate":"1757047299","recommendations":55,"replyCount":6,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144772172","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9593341946601868}

I appreciated so many of the clues/answers, some perhaps for personal reasons. As a life-long Cardinals fan I was pleased to see the nod to Hall of Famer Scott ROLEN. As for Belle STARR, I knew that right off as it took me back almost 40 years when I came across the story “The Man Who Knew Belle Starr” in the Atlantic, which was my introduction to one of my literary icons, Richard Bausch…a discovery so important to me that, as I write this, I can see again the pages in the magazine.\n\nAt any rate, congratulations to Bryan Cheong on a splendid debut.","createDate":"1757077396","updateDate":"1757131727","approveDate":"1757077396","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144777090","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5298657417297363}

In this edition, I’ll be talking about Robyn Weintraub. Robyn is known for her playful Friday puzzles, which have earned her the affectionate nickname “Queen of Fridays.” She has had a big influence on what kinds of themeless puzzles are popular. While some constructors want to trick you, Robyn just wants you to have fun. As a constructor, she’s not working against you — she’s working with you. She tends to make puzzles with higher word counts so they can be extra clean, and she focuses on making every long entry in the grid feel like a treat.\n\nI asked Robyn how she goes about making a themeless puzzle, and she wrote:\n\n“When I start making a themeless puzzle, my goal is to pack the grid with as many fun, long entries as possible. I typically aim for 12 or 14 entries that are at least eight letters long. To get started, I’ll either reuse a grid layout I’ve had success with or design a new one that supports a strong set of marquee entries. Then I dive into the fill, focusing on entries that strike me as clever, amusing or original. I especially like featuring conversational phrases — I feel they bring a lot of personality to the puzzle. At this stage, I don’t think about cluing at all.”\n\n[continued below]","createDate":"1757084785","updateDate":"1757115892","approveDate":"1757084786","recommendations":8,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144783444","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-05","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7136837244033813}

It’s more complex than soccer, the basic rules of which can be explained in five minutes or less. Baseball has to be experienced in a milieu where you have time to pick the game up slowly among people who already understand it. Like when you are a kid growing up in a baseball household. Europeans have already got soccer; everyone around you watches it.  Learning what seems like a complicated foreign sport that no one there watches seems pointless. It’s like everyone is playing checkers, so you don’t want to learn to play chess. \n\nAnd you have to have a rooting interest. If you don’t have a home team to cheer for, you’re just watching random games.  The thing about baseball is that it’s played almost every day for six months, with a month of playoffs afterwards. It’s with you day in and day out throughout the warmer months. It’s background noise while you’re having dinner, driving, sitting in your yard. It keeps you company, and it entertains you; you don’t have to entertain it. It’s inexpensive if you follow on radio and TV, but once in a while, it’s great fun to go and see in person. But it’s always entertaining.

They parked their cars side-by-side and noticed that his car was getting hit by feces.

See the above stories.  I once had a crow drop a blossom on me.  \n\nIn another anecdote I read, a bird (again I can’t remember whether it was a crow or a raven) used to pester a man, so the man would sometimes brandish a knife at the bird. At some point, the bird pecked at the man’s hand, causing him to drop the knife.  The bird then picked up the knife and flew away with it, and the man never saw the knife again.  It takes pretty advanced intelligence to decide to go after the hand to effect a more permanent solution rather than go after the knife, which was the immediate cause of trouble.\n\nCrows are very protective parents so, when they are protecting their precious young, they can dive bomb people. If that happens, know that they attack from behind, so if you simply put your hand at the back of your head with the fingers straight up and wiggle your fingers, they don’t want to mess with that.","createDate":"1757117634","updateDate":"1757117634","approveDate":"1757117634","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144792300,"parentUserDisplayName":"Cindy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144798569","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6056717038154602}

Here are some of my favorite clues from her past puzzles:\n\n[Cold war aggressions?] = SNOWBALL FIGHTS\n\n[Concrete example of rotational forces and fluid dynamics?] = CEMENT MIXER\n\n[Turning point in telecommunications history?] = ROTARY DIAL\n\n[Trashy television character?] = OSCAR THE GROUCH\n\n[Cheeky attire?] = SHORT SHORTS\n\n[Tip line?] = KEEP THE CHANGE\n\n[General recommendation?] = BATTLE PLAN\n\nWhen the editors review themeless puzzles, we occasionally see one made by a newer constructor that’s clean and fresh and fun, without any cruddy entries holding the puzzle together. The highest compliment we can pay it is to say, “Wow, it’s rather Weintraubian!” Robyn’s crossword style has influenced many constructors to make grids like hers, packed with juicy, long entries and held together with real, clueable words rather than abbreviations. Robyn’s skill at making crossword puzzles has forced the editors to raise the bar for themeless puzzles.\n________\nThe Easy Mode newsletter almost always has something that would be interesting for solvers at any level.
