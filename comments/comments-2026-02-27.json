That's gotta be one of my favorite posts on this board, ever.\n\n@SP\n\nVowel movements, eh? Nice one. \n\n\"Ladislaw\" is supposed to be Polish? Władysław is a traditional Polish first name, always spelled with that initial W. To see it without that W, and as a surname, too, is mighty weird. I wonder if any Polish 19th century novel has a (half) English character called John Illiam or Robert Teven...\n\nI still find it funny how English speakers, who pretty much write down their language however they see fit, and have actual words that are pronounced differently even though they are spelled the same (polish and Polish, say), think us Poles have loco spelling. For us, what you see is what you get - if it's spelled a certain way there is only ever one way to pronounce it.","createDate":"1772176723","updateDate":"1772229520","approveDate":"1772176724","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":149190134,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"149191151","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-02-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8622467517852783}

It is more of a collective for coins in general. \n\nYou wouldn't show your 1895 Liberty $5 gold piece to a friend, announcing it as \"Check out this cool coinage in my collection!\" Likewise, you wouldn't refer to a SACAGAWEA DOLLAR as a \"cool (or insert your preferred adjective here) coinage.\" It's a \"cool coin.\" \n\nThe wording of the clue, without the \"?\", definitely would sound like \"coinage\" here means \"to form a new word.\"\n\nHence, the misdirection, and the reason for the question mark. \n\nPersonally, I think the clue would work with or without the question mark, with a slight preference for NOT including it, since this is a Friday puzzle.

I will say that most of the crossword creating applications have word lists which can be added to and maintained. Cruciverb.com has word lists that they constantly update and has been invaluable to me. But I know that constructors who are dedicated may add their own words and phrases as well. In addition, those word lists have some ratings for phrases or words that can be tweaked by the users, so good constructors may downgrade entries that they don’t want to use a lot to make sure their grids are cleaner. Finally, especially for themeless puzzles, good constructors usually find a few good fresh “seed” entries that they want in their puzzles and then use the software to work around those.
