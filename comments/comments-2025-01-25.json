As usual, proper nouns and abbreviations were my nemesis. One of the names I did *not* have to look up was NOEL Coward - I'm not a theater person, but my wife and I stayed at a hotel in his former villa, Blue Harbor, on Jamaica in 2011, and I learned the name there. Chilling in a hammock by an infinity pool overlooking the Caribbean will forever be one of my fondest memories.\n\nSome clues were beyond me for cultural reasons. For example, Christmas elfs (elves?) are not a thing over here, so the hat was a mystery to me (felt gave me hat, but what kind of three letter hat is associated with Xmas? None, to me).\n\nNOVOCAINE is not sold here that I know of, and its clue was beyond arcane for me, anyway.\n\nHow is a MORTUARY a body shop? I get that a body shop is a place where a car's bodywork gets fixed, so clearly wordplay was intended, but how do mortuaries fix bodies? Is it about your grisly American custom of embalming? To me it feels like mutilation of a body rather than fixing it up... \n\nI only know UPC as a European internet service provider, but clearly that was not today's UPC.

Had to use all my skills for this one, right down to looking at the start of 31D and the start of 37A to figure out what letter was likely to fit in their cross (not that many readily follow both HA- and R-, and guessing that it was probably I is what allowed me to unlock the rest of the SW.) Still managed to get it a few seconds ahead of my Saturday average, too. \n\nNever in all my years of crosswording (or getting degrees in English, or being an English teacher) do I recall OMOO, but I got it with my last fill-in and thereby learned something I'll try to keep in mind going forward. \n\nThank you for the Saturday-worthy crunch, Mr. Lieberman.

Maybe, if I stretched.\n\nAs usual in a good puzzle, I learned something. I have visited the Great Wall three times but had never heard about the salt tax.

That was quite a workout for me! It took me about twice my normal time, which is already nothing much to brag about.

Still, I did need it in the southeast. I was at a complete blank down there.  I very rarely use check puzzle anymore, but I didn't have any lookups. I was tempted a few times though.\n\nAnyhow, I enjoyed working at it. Definitely some clever misdirects. I got NOVOCAINE, but I didn't understand it until I read the column. Ahhhh! Got me again! I have been duped by the alternate use of number before in the puzzles and hopefully this will be a good reminder. I'm pretty good at twisting words to see other meetings usually, but I do not think of number as a thing that numbs. Maybe next time!  Besides, I prefer N2O / laughing gas and ask for it every chance I get! 😁  \n\nAnyhow, that was probably my favorite one. I also like \"novel technology\" for for EREADER.

Second of all, while the salt tax was omnipresent throughout Chinese history (as well as in many other parts of the world such as India), I have never read anything that suggested it was the primary source of funding for the wall at any point. Google doesn’t turn up anything besides blogs, that slate article,  and Wikipedia. Wikipedia’s source is an article about contemporary salt production and taxation in the 1930s, which, while interesting, has nothing to do with the Ming Dynasty and doesn’t mention the wall at all. I don’t have access to the tax and budget documentation primary sourcing (nor would I be able to read it), but in the plethora of secondary sourcing I’ve read the salt tax funding the wall is never brought up, which is strange because that would be a significant thing to note given how often the salt taxes led to revolts or widespread theft at salt quarries. Ultimately, I cannot prove a negative, but in my research I have never seen it brought up.

But so do many Presidents, military officers, municipal officials, and others. Wikipedia lists literally *dozens* of sash wearers, including Scouts and diplomats. The royal use of sashes is a small minority. (The sashes you see King Charles wearing are to denote his membership in certain Honors, like the Order of the Garter, which 23 other people are also allowed to wear. For axample, Prince William and Princess Anne wore that sash at the Coronation, so def not just for Kings!)\n\nAnd yes, I agree that grief is stressful. It could also be described as *a* STRESS. But going from the specific to the generic is - IM[not so humble ]O - an unfair trick. Using that logic, I could clue the word STRESS with almost anything: gridlock; job interview; proposing marriage birth of your child; being fired... anything that causes STRESS.\n\nMy point being that there's no specific connection from the clue to the answer. Once you have the answer from the crosses you can find a way to link them, but the connection is quite a stretch.","createDate":"1737829710","updateDate":"1737843296","approveDate":"1737829710","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139250972,"parentUserDisplayName":"Grumpy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139259159","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-25","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5259231328964233}
