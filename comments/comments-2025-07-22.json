Plus the word “lame” seems like one we should avoid in general. But in this case, I reread Grumpy’s post and it wasn’t that terrible. He didn’t even call the entire puzzle lame, just the theme, and didn’t really attack the constructor personally. Replace the word lame with “lacking” or “disappointing” and I would see nothing particularly objectionable. \n\nIf I were to word this more constructively myself, I would agree that the theme was particularly unnecessary to the solve, and I was disappointed there was nothing in the first revealer to point to ice cream at all.

It is a horrific monstrosity of a car, with all the wrong proportions, one of the ugliest things to have ever disgraced the Earth. If I see a man driving one, the only thing I can think about are his obviously tiny private parts. Am I insulting BMW engineers by saying that?\n\nI've said this before and I'll say this again - by having their puzzles published, the constructors leave themselves open to all sorts of comments. We are not all required to love every puzzle, and we surely don't have to keep quiet when we don't like one. I truly hated an Adrian Johnson Friday puzzle several months ago and said so - I described how I felt about it, and my post was truthful. I found the puzzle nasty and described it as such.

However, sometimes it makes sense to give the boss everything you've got. The leader of the group will shout: NUKE! and everybody forgets about tactics, and just goes crazy. It's usually done when things start going badly in the final phase of the encounter, and desperation is all that remains 🤣.\n\nAs for microwave nuking, it was interesting for me to realize what sorts of terms I don't know in English. If it's not sexy enough to be in books, films, or on tv - like something extremely domestic, say - I won't be familiar with it. Take cooking terminology. I learned mine from my tutor, and then from cook books, cooking shows, films, books, and series. A microwave may be used on tv, sure, but it's always in the background, never subject of conversations. I think you have to have lived in an English-speaking household (possibly in the 80s,as you say) to know NUKE as a microwave term.\n\nBtw. Your nickname.

So much energy it can blow electrons off of atoms - which is called ionizing radiation.\nMicrowaves can't do that, so they're called non-ionizing radiation.\nNon-ionizing radiation can cause severe burns in people (and other living things), while ionizing radiation can cause cancer and other very nasty effects.\nSo the difference between microwaving and actually nuking is in large part a matter of the energy levels involved.\nIn my book, the similarities totally justify calling microwaving \"nuking\", which we do in my household.","createDate":"1753164496","updateDate":"1753223276","approveDate":"1753164498","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143704656,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143705240","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-22","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5133670568466187}

I ignored it for decades - the rest of the world seemed so much more interesting! However, in 2023 I went for a short trip with my father (our first holiday together in ages) around Dolny Śląsk, Lower Silesia. It's roughly the the SW corner of Poland, with a rich history, mostly as part of Germany (before 1945 Poles had ruled there until the middle of the 14th century). The castles, the towns, the food, the beer, the winding mountain roads, the forests - it was amazing, as good as anything I've experienced elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe decades of \"communism\" left their ugly mark, of course, in places, but Poland is well worth seeing. \n\nI also recently realized Warsaw - which I had dismissed as a messy, uninteresting place for most of my life - is a fascinating city, in some respects similar to Berlin. Horribly scarred by WW2, it came back to life, and after a few ugly, chaotic decades following the fall of the old regime in 1989, at present it is thriving: what monuments are left have been meticulously [the spelling of this word! sheesh!] restored, hundreds of thousands of new trees have been planted (on top of the millions already there), the city center is being made pedestrian-friendly after decades of automotive horror, and there are great cafes, bars, and restaurants everywhere. Public transport is A PLUS, there are loads of accommodations.\n\nDo come visit.","createDate":"1753172758","updateDate":"1753220737","approveDate":"1753172760","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143705809,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143705919","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-22","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8486769199371338}
