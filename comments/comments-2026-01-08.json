To those who say that there's usually more of an indication that there are rebuses afoot, my thought was finally a puzzle where we get to figure out where the rebuses are by ourselves again. But as Rich in Atlanta has said, No big deal. Liked the clues for ROSA and TSO'S.

Not quite tricky enough for Thursday though, maybe? I generally expect more weirdness this time of the week.

Now I know I've seen ELOTE before, probably in these puzzles, but I couldn't remember it today. I suppose Sir ELTON Hercules John is Elton John of music? As clued he was a mystery to me.

I hear what you are saying but in the future I think these hints will help:\n\n1) Double rebuses are rare to begin with, and would even be more rarely seen with only one letter in both directions\n\n2) if a double rebus is used, the revealer will will indicate some justification for the rebus, and indicate that it applies to a location or cell in the grid, not just across entries\n\n3) Think about the implication of the revealer. GRADE INFLATION means that the grade was CHANGED from a lower to higher grade—not that both grades exist together or side by side.\n\n4) In general, assume that a rebus isn’t used if it isn’t necessary, and in this case it isn’t. The grade inflation is implied by the change in the letter for the across, and the downs are perfect as they are.\n\n5) Lastly, I say this about any double rebus—if you think it’s one, only put in one direction to save yourself the headache of making sure the order or formatting is correct. It’s usually pretty standard but I hear enough complaints and have never had a problem doing this. This may or may not have helped today if you happened to put the incorrect across letter in and not the downs.\n\nAgain, you are not stupid or thoughtless for thinking there might be—after all, a lot of smart people came to the same conclusion—but in my experience the above criteria would be necessary for a rebus and they weren’t met in this case, so maybe this will help.","createDate":"1767901258","updateDate":"1767941884","approveDate":"1767901258","recommendations":21,"replyCount":14,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147893070","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6553432941436768}
