Then came the gathering of the albums and the actual fabrication of the tape with the careful placing of the needle on the disc, monitoring the volume level and fading the songs where appropriate.

A grateful “Ahh” spontaneously radiated from me out into the universe when I saw it.\n\nOh, sure, it creates five mini-puzzles, which is scary, because it’s Saturday, and the corners don’t get much help from the center, but praises to the constructor and editor for intelligently placing footholds to make the puzzle fair.\n\nThe grid pattern was done once before in the Times, 4/18/20, by Ryan McCarty. What marked that puzzle was the pop in the center. Billy followed suit today, with seven NYT answer debuts in that section.  So much skill went into making this puzzle, a 66-worder with hardly a whiff of junk, and so vibrant.\n\nI, a lover of wordplay, emitted “Hah!” after “Hah!” after “Hah!” from the wit that saturated the cluing: [Line around the Equator], [Comment with a point], [Gross home?], and [Cheerios alternative] for starters.\n\nAnother “Hah!” followed the serendipitous cross of SIT HERE and a backward SAT AT.\n\nI actually left this puzzle wired, electrified by the pop, the cleverness, and the joy of riddle-cracking that this grid gave me.  This was a wow.  This was scintillating.  More, Billy, more please!
