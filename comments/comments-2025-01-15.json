This one was all in the clues. One example: \n\n\"With 7-Down, literally, neither wins nor loses\" \nBREAKS\n\nExcept that the answer to 7 down was OXES. Hmmm. Oh, ok - turns out that the implied trick was SEVEN down. But the S at the end of BREAKS crossed the down answer at 5 down, which was PRESSEVENT.

In each, the themes showcase English language quirks teeming with wordplay, puzzles which have simultaneously dropped my jaw and widened my smile.\n\nParker has a marvelous knack for finding these quirks; I don’t know if they just pop into his head or if he belongs to some quirk-study program.  But they’re terrific, IMO.\n\nIf you want to experience or be reminded of his previous three, go to the archives and check out 6/16/22, 5/17/23, and 9/12/24.\n\nToday he also widened my smile with some lovely non-theme entries.  PREBOARDED, for one, felt fresh to me, and when I looked it up after solving, I saw why – neither it, nor “preboard”, nor “preboards”, nor “preboarding” have ever appeared in any of the major crossword venues.  A true debut, plucked out of the ether.  \n\nSome lovely single-word answers as well: TENDERS (as clued), REGALIA, and the omg gorgeous FULSOME. I also loved column five – KEEL, SRS, LOOT – a palindrome sandwiched by two semordnilaps.  \n\nJust an abundance of lovely in the box today.

Across Lite is a format that could only reproduce very ordinarily formatted puzzles. It was available as an option many years ago back when there were few other options for online solving. (The NYT’s own interface/app wasn’t running yet.)\n\nOnce the NYT online version was available for several years, with both it and Across Lite provided, the Times stopped offering AL as a solving option. \n\nMany of the commentariat went ballistic. I tried to persuade them to switch to the NYT’s own version, but they had their quirky reasons why they didn’t want to. \n\nI also discovered an add-on called Crossword Scraper that would still allow them to download the puzzle in AL through this third party, but that was apparently too much for these solvers to handle. \n\nEventually, the ruckus died down and everyone adjusted, as the NYT was counting on. \n\nI’ll add that there was another third-party app, Puzzazz, that was able to duplicate unusual puzzles just like the newspaper had them, which the NYT’s own interface couldn’t, but the NYT in their wisdom decided to end their permission for that app to grab the puzzles. Probably related to ad views.  That was the one I was sorry to see go, but that’s when my NYT streak started.","createDate":"1736957754","updateDate":"1737000178","approveDate":"1736957757","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139014092,"parentUserDisplayName":"John Carson","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139015244","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6583890914916992}

Each suit has number cards from ace thru ten, but four face cards--page, knight, queen, and king. In addition, there are 21 numbered picture cards--the Major Arcana (we just had that in a puzzle, last week, as I remember)--with images like The Magician (I) and The World (XXI). The Major Arcana are sometimes referred to as the Greater Trumps. Just so you know. Also, a Fool which belongs to none. Just so you know. So, seventy-six total.\n\nOf course, there's a lot of variation, both historical and geographical. In English speaking places, the tarot is used primarily for cartomancy (fortune-telling), but I understand that in some European countries they're primarily used for games specific to that deck.\n\nMost of the popular images of tarot cards--especially the arcana major--originate with the Rider-Waite-Smith deck designs (first published 1909--if you can use the verb \"publish\" in this context), which itself has an interesting history.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider</a>%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot","createDate":"1736964967","updateDate":"1736978955","approveDate":"1736964968","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139017156,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139019522","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8306479454040527}

I think it's accurate to say that Many SAT takers are seniors.

And Normal's growth has come in recent decades; back in the 30s, around when the phrase \"Will it play...\" was popularized, PEORIA outpopulated Normal by about 20 to 1.
