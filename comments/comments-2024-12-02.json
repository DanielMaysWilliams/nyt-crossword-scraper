Apparently in English bench only denotes a thing you sit on, while us Poles may sit on a ławka (bench) or at a ławka (school desk).\n\nA desk you would use at the office or at home would never be called a ławka. It's always a \"biurko\". If you see hints of the word \"bureau\" there, you're correct. The two are related (the \"biu-\" of biurko sounds the same in Polish as the \"bu-\" of bureau). Also, the Polish word for office is biuro (the word biurko appears to be a diminutive of biuro btw), pronounced almost the same as bureau.\n\nSo, the same desk would be called either a ławka or a biurko, depending on whether it would be found in a classroom or elsewhere. Weird.\n\nOne idea I've just had with my wife is that historically schools used furniture similar to church pews - where the seat and the bureau were joint together. Over the decades the furniture changed: the pew-like bench/desk combo was substituted by chairs and desks, but the old terminology remained, now denoting just the desk. This is why today we say one sits \"w ławce\" at school, literally \"in a bench\" (rather than at or on one) - because a pew-like desk/bench enveloped you and you sat \"in\" it. \n\nLanguage is fascinating.","createDate":"1733120738","updateDate":"1733208427","approveDate":"1733120742","recommendations":51,"replyCount":9,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137988217","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6846132278442383}

This is their seventh collab.\n\nNo surprise then that today’s puzzle does what Monday puzzles are supposed to do.  Almost every answer in everyday language.  Clues that are relatively easy, but overall not embarrassingly so.  The former is difficult to accomplish because it greatly constricts answer possibilities. The latter is an art.  \n\nI like the PuzzPair© of FOOT and DEGAS, because the former is often put on the latter.  I like that five-S clump in the NW, with part of it being PSST, which echoes the theme (Hi, @John Ezra!).  Fun to see a number of answers that commonly go with “over” – SEES, USE, STAY, and the NE pair THE HUMP.\n\nAs an experienced solver, I expect to slap answers down in splats on Monday, but today had the extra thrill of slapping down the last three theme answers after getting the first two.  Talk about “Whee!”.\n\nSo, thrill and beauty for me in the box today, an excursion through loveliness.
