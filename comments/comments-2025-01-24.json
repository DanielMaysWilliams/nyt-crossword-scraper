The puzzle was, as they say, in my wheelhouse. I solved it while I was listening to a Warriors game (they won!!) and still finished the puzzle in less than 30 min.  \n\nA big help was my second fill, the Magritte pipe, which made so many crosses much easier. The S in the god of the afterlife gave me OSIRIS, even though it was news to me that his skin was green.  Pollack's art accessory—at first I thought of brush, then EASEL emerged from a cross.  I don't know many three-letter Greek goddesses and the ights went on with EOS.\n\nSo many long fills that juped out with a few letters made the whole puzzle much easier, but it seems to have been one of those times when the constructor (thank you Mr. Lim) was an old friend and we were talking about the same things. Many puzzles that were a breeze to other solvers have been a trial for me.\n\nThe whole puzzle may have been a quick solve, but it was rich with good cluing.

(Taylor Swift's concert on TV was great!)\n\nI will be the first to admit that I listen to a SiriusXM radio show on a regular basis that features new artists in my preferred genre (country).  It's an hour long, and every song is by a new artist, or is a new song by an artist that has only had a few hits so far.  It's nice to listen to it, but it's one hour a week.  (Some of them go on to added to the regular rotation; some do not; a lot of them are not that memorable.)  SiriusXM knows not to program an entire channel that way, so they incorporate it into the channel that plays the current hit artists.\n\nBut the point is, would you like to listen only to new artists, to the point of pushing the established artists out?

It is possible to do both.  The tried and true carries no guarantee of being superior to the fresh and new.  In any case, I don’t think the concert analogy is that apt.  Some of the artists in your star studded concert are primarily reprising past hits, and haven’t produced interesting music in years.  The crossword constructors on the other hand must always create anew.  While the constructors you name may well be more likely to create a pleasing puzzle than a debutant constructor, the world of puzzling can only be enhanced by the addition of new voices.\n\nParenthetically, I went to see Elton John on one of his many farewell tours a few years ago. His voice was shot, the sound system was awful, and the person sitting next to me insisted on singing along loudly with every song  …. Out of tune.  It was one of the worst concerts I ever attended.  That doesn’t diminish Sir Elton’s  body of work, but I’d rather go take a chance on some new talent.","createDate":"1737722353","updateDate":"1737753486","approveDate":"1737722354","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139222722,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139228816","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.563407301902771}

Musicians are not a good comparison for crossword constructors because,  while musicians have the luxury of replaying their hits, crossword constructors must always create anew.  I’d wager that a majority of people go to a Billy Joel or James Taylor or Elton John concert to hear the old stuff, not the new stuff, and that’s fine.  The availability of the old material is why one may prefer to see a star studded concert to a new talent showcase.  That’s a different rationale than choosing to do New Yorker puzzles because you have faith that the new material from your favorite constructors will be of comparable quality to to their prior work.\n\nMy other point is that any endeavor needs to constantly develop new talent.  And luckily we don’t have to choose between the old and new.  We can do puzzles in both the New Yorker and NYT or anywhere else for that matter at our pleasure, just as we can go to the all star concert and the new talent showcase (unless they’re on the same night).  \n\nI’d be curious to hear what music from the 21st century by Elton John, Billy Joel, James Taylor, or Paul McCartney you find on par with their earlier work.","createDate":"1737733123","updateDate":"1737748236","approveDate":"1737733124","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139229935,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139235344","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6484914422035217}
