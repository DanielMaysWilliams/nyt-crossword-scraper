No excuses! Let neither SNOWY white-out blizzard nor FLASH FLOOD keep you away! But first, a few tips:\n\n1) It's a gym, not a SPA--don't PERCH on that incline bench whilst you check your social media--other people are waiting to use it!\n\n2) Speaking of social media--in that swolfie you're about to snap (SAY CHEESE!), you will look hotter, more defined when UPLIT--now that's JPG worthy of Insta!\n\n3) Always remember to TARE the scale before you weigh yourself, unless your goal *is* to bulk--everyone FIBS about their weight; it's no great SIN one needs to make AMENDs for!\n\n4) Speaking of SINS--remember to do you LAUNDRY regularly--no one wants you smelling like a flock of crop-destroying EMUS!\n\n5) Some exercises can be less dangerous, and more productive if done with a spotter, A DUE. Just make sure they're reliable, and won't leave you stranded mid-set gasping \"DON'T LEAVE me!\"\n\n6) That gorilla with the 18\"guns doing preacher-curls--I dare you to go up to him and say \"technically, the plural is bicipites.\"--I just *dare you! Oh wait, you just did--well, SUCKS TO BE YOU.","createDate":"1735906713","updateDate":"1735952873","approveDate":"1735906717","recommendations":26,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138720953","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6981543898582458}

But I guess that's just me.\n\nI've never forgotten my two forays into the casino world at a young, impressionable age -- one on the Vegas strip and maybe five years later one in that big casino in Monte Carlo.  The bettors in Vegas, even when they only had $50 on the table, were sweaty and FLUSHed  and beyond angsty.  They bet as though their futures depended on that bet -- and looking at them, I guessed that in some cases it might have. The well-heeled, well-dressed bettors in Monte Carlo might have had $1,000 on the table (this was the 1960s and that was real money back then) looked bored and blase.  They could well afford to lose it.\n\nMy other mistake, though I didn't write any more in than SUCh was the dismissive \"that's rather unfortunate response.  I had SUC, I needed a T for TRUSS, and SUCH A TRAGEDY fit perfectly.  Who would have guessed that the much, much nastier SUCKS TO BE YOU was the answer.\n\n(To be continued below)","createDate":"1735919803","updateDate":"1735954332","approveDate":"1735919808","recommendations":8,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138727339","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-03","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6918354630470276}

The slightly debauched pagan Petronius is the only person in that book with any sort of depth. In the Polish movie adaptation of the book - a very bad film otherwise - he was played to surprisingly great effect by the aging action hero Bogusław Linda).\n\nSienkiewicz's other historical novels - the 17th century trilogy of \"Ogniem i mieczem\", \"Potop\" and \"Pan Wołodyjowski\", and the 15th century \"Krzyżacy\" - are much better and played an important role in defining Polish national identity in the late 19th century. He created some of our most beloved literary characters, like the sly yet bumbling Onufry Zagłoba, the gentle giant Podbipięta, the master swordsman Michał Wołodyjowski and the conflicted hero/villain Andrzej Kmicic. Does the last name look familiar? I'm named after him 🤣.\n\nSienkiewicz had a singular writing style - blending modern and historical Polish  - which I have always really liked. I can actually imitate it quite well: ask me to switch into Sienkiewicz mode and I'll instantly produce prose indistinguishable from his.","createDate":"1735885062","updateDate":"1735961949","approveDate":"1735885065","recommendations":20,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138717728,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138719060","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6039755940437317}
