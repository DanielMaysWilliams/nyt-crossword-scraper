As for Marvin Gaye, there are many versions of I Heard It Through The Grapevine, but none better than his.  Just as good were his efforts to meld soul music with social awareness like What’s Going On and Mercy Mercy Me (the ecology).

Not that we should change it but ask yourself: there isn’t a best female director category, or best female screenwriting category, or anything like that. So why is that? Seems like when the Oscars were established there had to have been one of three reasons for dual acting awards: 1) women have a different sort of acting style and should be judged under different criteria; 2) they recognized an underling bias and felt like women would not be judged fairly alongside men, or recognized that women did not get by the same quality of roles or 3) they had a real bias and thought that women could not act as well as men and therefore should be judged separately. So ask yourself is that still the same today? If not why not have a best acting category of ten men and women and give to two? Again I’m not advocating this, I love the glitz and glamor of the Oscars and it seems right; but it’s an interesting thought experiment.","createDate":"1758981285","updateDate":"1759013168","approveDate":"1758981286","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":8343043363046193,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"8346472743436571","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5993390679359436}

Thanks.  I followed some of that link, which pointed to another site for the \"Safe Sleep 7\" as an authority.  And there it didn't sound all that safe!  It seems that only a typical breast-feeding mother will assume a natural bed position that will protect the baby.  The article cautions against even part-time bottle feeders as potential hazards until 4 months (because the baby may be placed closer to pillows, among other things).\n\nSounds like a mixed story at best, and I would lean strongly toward the American model.
