Start with SLANT.  (STERN is also good.)\n2. If you get no letters (after SLANT), guess CORED second.\n3. Do not be afraid to guess a word that couldn't win but eliminates several common remaining letters, especially if you have too many options remaining for the letters you've already revealed.  (For example, if you have _ASTE, it could be W, H, P, B, T, C, so guess BATCH.  Then you may get the right letter, or at least eliminate four of them.)\n4. If guessing to win, don't guess plurals ending in S or past tense verbs ending in -ED (unless they're more commonly adjectives, like TIRED).\n5. Find a list of most common letters in each position of a five letter word (yes, they're out there) and use it to select your letters carefully.  N may be a top-five letter overall, but it's near the bottom for the first letter.  Y may be a bottom-five letter overall, but it's the second most common last letter.\n6. Practice!  Try Duotrigordle.  You get to solve 32 Wordles simultaneously.  It's not as hard as you think.  Always choose SLANT and CORED first before even trying to do the individual games.  Then choose WIMPY, GIMPY or BUMPY as your third guess.  After doing that, you start playing the individual games.  You may find that several of them are done or practically done by then.  Any info you glean applies to all the games.

You couldn’t guess them immediately as a common phrase, you would have to deduce from the down entries. That didn’t bother me. As I mentioned in my own comment, I thought the inner entries were just a little bland—“king” and “cat” and “ent” which are short and probably could have fit in any number of phrases, so I would have wanted a little more creativity in the inside words even if they weren’t necessarily consecutive letters.
