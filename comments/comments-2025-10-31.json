With a lot of guesswork I managed to fill the grid on my own. Alas, I did not get my gold star.

I always recall most of it, but each time it appears in a puzzle I make at least one error in it. Last time it had been AzO, and today AYO aDEBIRI. STINKY PaTE didn't look weird enough to pop as a mistake for me.\n\nOn the other side of the puzzle I had NEEDLE tRaP/ERtA/AMa. I had Latin classes at school but it was 30 years ago and I never was very good at them, anyway. The goddess and the needle thing were huge unknowns. Of course, now that I know it was NEEDLE DROP I see how it makes sense - for one who has seen a record player, anyway, and my mother had one when I was a kid.\n\nGirl scout cookies are not a thing here, but it's such a trope in American culture that I've been familiar with them for decades. I just had to work the crosses for TROOPS today.\n\nBtw. Poland has a vigorous scouting community. In our gendered language we call our scouts \"harcerki\" (female) and \"harcerze\" (male). When scouting was introduced in the early 20th century, Polish people consciously rejected the loan word \"skaut\" and instead revived an old word, unused for centuries at the time, originally denoting a brave young soldier.","createDate":"1761890906","updateDate":"1761996597","approveDate":"1761890908","recommendations":44,"replyCount":23,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146317890","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-31","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7590317130088806}

It was reckless, of course, and no veteran soldiers ever engaged in it, but many interpreted it as the ultimate sign of bravery. A more honorable form of \"harce\" (the activity of harcownicy/harcerze) also existed: experienced knights would call on their opponents to face them in single combat before a battle. It was the ultimate test of skill and honor.\n\nApparently, the etymology is ultimately Latin, from \"arcus\", bow. The word arrived in Polish via Italian, German, and Czech. You may not see it, but the Polish harcerz sounds similar to the English archer, and for good reason. That being said, a Polish archer is... Łucznik, because łuk means bow.","createDate":"1761891684","updateDate":"1761959530","approveDate":"1761891685","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146317890,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146317936","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-31","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6962381601333618}
