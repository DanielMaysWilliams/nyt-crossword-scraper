When I first saw him in \"Homicide:  Life on the Streets\" back in the 90s, I thought he was going to be a mega star.\n\nBut somehow it never happened.  I can't figure out why.  I'm glad he found a role on Brooklyn 99, but my honest appraisal is that his talent was mostly wasted on comedy--he was so, so good in dramatic roles.\n\nThe puzzle itself, though I solved it in reasonable time, seems to be in this era's hardening of the early week puzzles, and easing (I'm told) on the late week.  I thought this was  a difficult puzzle, although there were some absolute gimmes as well.\n\nZHUZHUP was a difficult cross with KATZ, which is probably the most New York City-centric clue I've ever seen.  I've been there multiple times.  I'm sure it's a landmark but I have never heard of it, as far as I know, in any of the multitude of movies set in New York City.  I hope to hear what movies did mention it.\n\n[\"That slaps,\" for something good, e.g.\"] took me forever to parse, because I did not know the SLANG term.  Mostly crosses and guesses.\n\nI'll try to be plain--I did not enjoy this puzzle as much as I have others, but nevertheless it was a great diversion from the horror of the time.  If I could pass all my time this way, I might survive.\n\nSo thank you,  Michael B. Berg.\n\nTHE DEAD SIEGE was a monumental stretch to The Dead Sea.

Propaganda underscored how many universities, science academies and research institutes we had, and those places actually tried to do proper research. Only disciplines directly linked to the regime's ideology suffered from systemic faults - economics, for example. The biggest problem was lack of funding. By the 1980s Poland was in a deep crisis, caused partly by overspending in the previous decade. We were 20 or more years behind the West, but not for lack of trying.\n\nThe Polish autocracy pre-1989 was very much unlike what you think it was (methinks). Many of the government's agendas were actually very progressive, and oppression was minimal by Eastern Bloc standards (especially compared to the GDR, say).
