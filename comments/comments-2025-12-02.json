In the beautiful State House, where Massachusetts legislation takes place, bills rarely pass because the members of the house accuse each other of unfairly putting words and language in the text they can't understand or even pronounce.

Because it's French, and has a diacritic in it's name? But then, \"s'more\" has an unnecessary punctuation mark; and if we're talking empty calories, I'd say s'mores have éclairs beat hands down.\n\nIn fact, s'mores and éclairs bear certain morphological similarities: a rather bland flour-based shell enclosing an overly-sweet, gooey filling, with chocolate added, inside or on top.\n\nÉclairs are made with cream puff pastry*, which is one of the quickest and easiest doughs to prepare, if somewhat messy to clean up. True, for élcairs you need to make a custard (crème pâtissière) and chocolate glaze, but, hey, even instant pudding will do in a pinch. Even the great  poet Maya Angelou knew that: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/06/01/317843650/maya-angelou-foodie\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/2014/06/01/317843650/maya-angelou-foodie</a>\n(When I heard that segment air, I said \"Yes! Someone who finally gets it!\")\n\n*not to be confused with \"puff pastry,\" which is one of the most difficult and labor-intensive.

Back several years ago when I was in junior high (now middle school) here in Portland, Maine our jr highs were grades 7 - 9 due to overcrowding at our high schools. My school's restroom passes had LAV engraved on them and, as such, we soon learned that's where you asked to go when natured called. For the first week of school as 7th graders, however, most of us kept wondering why kids kept asking to go to what we misheard as \"the lab.\" It's the only school I ever attended where LAV was used so perhaps a more purist English teacher started that tradition (that I've always recalled with fondness!)","createDate":"1764698295","updateDate":"1764729622","approveDate":"1764698296","recommendations":6,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147009571","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8048230409622192}

Andrzej, the problem with your definition is that trivia would be different things to different people. To Sherlock Holmes, as I’ve pointed out before, it was “trivia” that the sun doesn’t revolve around the earth because it didn’t affect his life; while for most of us it’s common knowledge. If I watch football every week the name of a quarterback or a foul rule would not be trivia but a Shakespeare character would be. So as a constructor, I am always thinking, is this information that would be accessible to a majority of the solvers? And if not can I make sure the crossings are, or at least fair enough? (I wouldn’t cross two sports terms if I could avoid but maybe I’d cross a sports term with a Shakespeare term). Also, the best “trivia” is something the solver has heard of but perhaps not in the same context, or with some additional information that the solver could learn from. Finally, I’d try to limit the total number of entries that would be considered “trivia” by more people, although as I’ve said for a very tight theme I make more allowances for this. \nBy that criteria, I really don’t think this was a particularly trivia heavy grid for most US solvers. \nMy 2 cents.","createDate":"1764691440","updateDate":"1764691441","approveDate":"1764691441","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146995885,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147004679","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7721196413040161}

Guys, it’s ok to admit an answer was clumsy (or, yes!, objectionable). That does not amount to conceding that the overall puzzle was bad. Heck, it does not even amount to an endorsement of the complainer’s negativity! \n\nYes, I also don’t like it when people post complaints that are not counterbalanced by a compliment (or even so much as an acknowledgment of the constructor’s effort) when the crossword was good. And I like that the community will jump to keep the complainer honest. But that does not mean that *no complaint is ever valid*. \n\nDarren happens to be right. It doesn’t matter that such a thing as “CBS Radio” existed or that not every crossword answer can be neatly put in sentence form. The indisputable fact is that, at no point during Colbert’s employment at CBS has the channel employed the label “CBS TV” at all. And these are companies that actually do spend millions coming up with names and trademarking them.  Does it mean the term (made up as it is) is flat-out unacceptable? No, but it’s *certainly* quite open to dispute. \n\nIf CBSTV is unobjectionable, then it’s unreasonable to complain if the answer to “peddler of Word” is MICROSOFTAPPS, or if “Japanese multimedia giant” clues SONYCOMPANY. Microsoft peddles apps, Sony is a company, and CBS is a TV station, but that doesn’t mean it’s unobjectionable for constructors to freely make up terms without letting us know *in the clue* that they’re asking for more than the known name.","createDate":"1764734706","updateDate":"1764761747","approveDate":"1764734707","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147016173,"parentUserDisplayName":"Darren","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147023158","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-02","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4968699812889099}
