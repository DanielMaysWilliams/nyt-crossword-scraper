This page provides a direct channel for submitting detailed feedback and suggestions, which may be more effective in reaching the team responsible for the comments section format.

In fact, you must select one of three newsroom-related topics. There is no option for \"Other.\"\n\nI was going to try the nytgames address again, but it is no longer at the top of the comments section. The new message says there is a \"Contact Us\" link.

Also, I wouldn't be caught dead in a chain eatery, and I know very little about American ones, but if it's a chain in America and starts with an I, it's gotta be IHOP. And so on. So I guess what I liked today was how the arcana were crossed gently enough to not be unsolvable - unlike yesterday, when proper names and abbreviations crossed in several places, forcing me into lookups and puzzle checks.\n\nHad I known the trivia, I would probably have had a Wednesday solving experience, as I guess you did, and you felt cheated.\n\nNEMEAN was an enjoyable gimme. My wife and I visited Nemea on our spring trip to Greece a few years ago and we were enchanted by it. It is located where the mountains of the Peloponnese give way to hills stretching to the Gulf of Corinth. In ancient times, there was no city here, only a sanctuary of Zeus with a nearby stadium, used exclusively in the summer. Today, it is a rural landscape, completely idyllic, full of olive and orange groves, cypress trees, meadows, and fields.
