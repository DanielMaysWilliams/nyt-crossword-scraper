Her original Egyptian name translates literally as She of the Throne and was pronounced something like Ahs(e)t, with Ahs meaning throne, plus the feminizing -t. The Greeks dropped the -t and added the Greek feminizing -is, et voilà! Isis was born. And from the sibling-mother of Osiris, her myth eventually became much more universal. Here is Apuleius having her introduce herself in 2nd c. CE:  \n\n“I am Nature, the universal Mother, mistress of all the elements, primordial child of Time, sovereign of all things spiritual, queen of the dead, queen also of the immortals, the single manifestation of all gods and goddesses that are. (…)\n\nThough I am worshipped in many aspects, known by countless names, and propitiated with all manner of different rites, yet the whole round earth venerates me. The primeval Phrygians call me Pessinuntica, Mother of the Gods; the Athenians (…) call me Cecropian Artemis; for the islanders of Cyprus, I am Paphian Aphrodite; for the archers of Crete, I am Dictynna; for the trilingual Sicilians, Stygian Proserpine; and for the Eleusinians, their ancient Demeter.\n\nSome know me as Juno, some as Bellona of the Battles; others as Hecate; others again as Rhamnusia.

The BlackBerry (owned one) was primarily a phone but connected to the functionality of a PDA, like contacts and appointments. Frankly I thought it sucked as an Internet device.

I know who Burke is, but wasn't aware she coined the term in 2006. The \"metoo\" answer was in a mini puzzle (I think) in the past few days with 2017 in the clue. I guess it's one more example of white culture co-opting Black culture. Nice to hear the trend is to give credit where it's due, but it sure threw me as a crossword clue!
