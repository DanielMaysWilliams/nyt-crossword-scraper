I say this not because of the theme (note to those who object to \"jiggity jig\":  this can't be the first time you had to solve a theme word with its crossers--get over it), which I found interesting and typical of Wednesday wordplay.  No, it was the overabundance of obscure trivia, and, as you will see as follows, I really got cheesed at the un-level and wildly misleading clue for \"boss 'level'.\"  A carpenter's level is not an \"implement for ensuring stability\" (I was thinking a brace or a bracket or some other device that secures an object); it is an implement for determining whether a surface of an object is parallel or perpendicular to the earth (as represented by the force of gravity).  Such a determination MAY lead to a conclusion about the stability of some object, but whether that surface is level or plumb does not necessarily lead to any conclusion of (let alone the ensuring of) such object's stability (e.g., I'm not seeking to to ensure the stability of a picture frame hung on my wall, I'm determining whether my wife will approve of the installation job I did).","createDate":"1760570942","updateDate":"1760595108","approveDate":"1760570942","recommendations":9,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145961644","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.522336483001709}

Did folks like it? I finished this as we were pulling away from St Thomas and I'm pretty sure I couldn't complain about anything after spending a few hours in the water at Magan Bay. Oh my gosh, I love a lot of big water, but that beach is amazing!! I don't think I've ever been in clearer water, other than Lake Baikal, but this is certainly much more temperate, to say the least. If I believed in reincarnation, I might just believe that I had been or will be a mermaid in another life. 🧜‍♀️\n\nAnyhow, really enjoyed the puzzle too! So fun realizing that it is really *that* Nick Offerman?! As I was doing the puzzle, given the theme, I kind of thought it must be. Well, him or Ron Swanson... Har!  \n\nA few crunchy spots I found myself caught in some misdirects, we're going to say something but otherwise came together nicely. Of course I won't know how to compare myself to Xword stats because even though I got the gold star music, the puzzle is still running the timer and refuses to actually count it as a gold star, despite getting the music. I think it's because of my connection here at sea.

Some of it sticks and some of it doesn't, and where you are and when you're there has a lot ot do with it.  There was a gap for me between high school graduation when I was 16 and the university when I was 21.  I titled my first freshman English theme \"The Orange and the Yellow,\" for the ad scheduling sheet at the newspaper where I had worked as a general slave, and I had never heard of Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black,\" much less read it.  The prof who was teaching the class was excited about what I had written, and said, \"It's like Kafka!\"  I had no idea who he was talking about. Those five intervening years had taught me a lot about the workaday world, and the university taught me more about the rest of it, and it was all different.  A vast span of artists, their periods, their palettes,their styles, from Giotto to Giacometti, were the gift of a brilliant high school art teacher and far outstripped anything my new university pals knew about art. On the other hand, for other reasons, I was a complete dolt about so much, from differential equations to a lot of hot music, and I still am.\n\nBut I love words like yeet, yassify and nerfed, even when I don't know what they mean.","createDate":"1760554289","updateDate":"1760577958","approveDate":"1760554290","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145954434,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jerry","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145955710","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7133020162582397}
