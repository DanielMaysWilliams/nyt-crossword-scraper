Last to fall was S/SE, hadn't noticed 121A \"AaAS\" (which fits a common \"battery\" clue but not the clue given), what happened was— at 111D I had OHaI, not OHHI. \"O HAI!\" was once a very common meme (lolcats/lolspeak).\n<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-hai\" target=\"_blank\">https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-hai</a>\nI liked the theme; wouldn't've wanted to do it w/o the provided title tho.\n\nIt slowly took shape in pieces. Which is great for a Sunday. My objections to clues are: 83A, really? Maybe I'm just ignorant & many know it, but with the intricacy of this xword perhaps it coulda been clued as \"Paleo __\", or something *between* those two in ease/difficulty? Also, ⚠OOP never mind I just realized: At one point (before theme came into focus) I'd thought 84A SUBTRACTS was a word for \"Swaths of land\", & could've been clued less opaquely, but oops it was AOK as TRACTS  (w/the Seaview or Nautilus gliding thru). So maybe it was just one clue I kinda didn't like! But overall I think this was very clever, a good solid Sunday.\n\nFeedback? I really do wonder how many ppl are familiar w/DIET as clued, or— more to the point— have an opinion as to whether it needed to be such a (to me) toughish clue in that spot or perhaps coulda been, if not a gimme, at least a tad easier? For me the E/SE— w/NECCO, DIET, NOTELET, ICEHOLE (which totally makes sense but to my ears isn't a 'thing')— made 83A an apt spot for a breezier clue… whatcha think?","createDate":"1732479434","updateDate":"1732498657","approveDate":"1732479439","recommendations":2,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137850136","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6443395018577576}

Many of us know that.  But this is an English puzzle, and unless the puzzle is going for a foreign language clue like \"...in Sumatra\", the answer is in English.  \n\nWhen loan words come into a new language, there is often a semantic shift.  Latte means milk in Italian, but in English, it's a coffee drink with milk in it.  An entree is an appetizer in French, but in American English, it's a main dish.  These were originally mistaken usages, but they're firmly planted in the English language today.  Using them the English way is not a mistake.\n\nSimply stated, ORANG in English is just a shortening of orangutan.  Just like hippo, rhino, dino, etc.  No one is insulting Indonesians by calling people apes.  I guarantee fewer than 1% of English speakers know that ORANG means person in Bahasa.  In fact, fewer than 1% know what language they speak in Indonesia at all.\n\nIf you wish to take offense on behalf of the Indonesian people, feel free to.

Please don't give up on us!\n\nI have a theory about why your longer post didn't show up right away today, based on a comment of mine that took a long time to get posted. I think the filter might flag negative emotion words. My post that got delayed included the word \"annoy\" and I see your original one had that in it too. Now I guess I'll see if my reply shows up right away or gets delayed.\n\nAnother thought - I've noticed that my comments on forums I've contributed to frequently, like the Wordle review, show up immediately, but if I comment on something new there's almost always a delay. My theory about that is the Wordle review filter recognizes me as a known commenter, and the other filter doesn't know me from Adam. Corollary theory: the filter might have a list of people it considers potentially unsafe commenters.

People who, like me, live by the rule \"nothing goes to waste on the Serengeti\"  have been making it for decades.  We just didn't call it that or spend a small fortune buying it in a restaurant.  It's a great way to use up the extra avocados you bought to ensure that you have perfectly ripe ones when you want them.  It can be as simple as mashing them with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper and tossing on a fried egg (my preference) with sea salt and red pepper flakes, or as complicated as you like.  Nicely toasted Tuscan bread under it all never hurts.
