These wonderful conundrums allow me to pause and explore truth, beauty, and knowledge. I have always enjoyed the mental gymnastics required to unravel such enigmas, and reading the comments here reminds me I am less alone in my pursuit. Puzzles are alive and well.\n\nI am thankful for the constructors themselves. Solving, and appreciating, a crossword is like beholding a radiant canvas, painted by artists who decided to share their gifts with the world (just don't give them the brush-off; that wouldn't be palette-able). I am encouraged by the creativity of these cruciverbalists and the hope and delight they provide.\n\nI am thankful for the columnists here who reflect upon these puzzles and help shape this special community. Moreover, I am thankful for writers everywhere who remind us of our humanity and encourage us regularly to lead with peace, grace, and love.\n\nI am thankful for wordplay, whether well-worn or punderated. I would even go see a performance on the history of lexicography; that would really be a play on words.\n\nAnd I am thankful for all of you and for how much love and kindness exists in this humble space. I exhort you to continue to brighten the world however you feel called. Empathy can still be cool.\n\nWith best wishes for a happy holiday season, filled with plenty of pie and puzzles!\n\nMike\n\n(PS: Please pass the rolls!

WISHBONEFORMATION is a pretty arcane sports term, although gettable from the clue; KREBSCYCLE a pretty arcane biochemical term, and only gettable from the crosses if you aren’t familiar—but pretty fair crosses except maybe for ODEON which is bread and butter to experienced cruciverbalists but maybe not to newer solvers. And, there’s math.\nBut I thoroughly enjoyed the theme and thought the theme entries were fresh and interesting. I LOVED the misdirect that the first rebus was the same up and down but not the others; that absolutely sold the puzzle for me.\nAnd for all you rebus haters out there, that’s cool, but if your issues are technical I say again, don’t try to shove “three/nine” in the circle or whatever, just put in one number and do the rest in your head, it’ll save you a headache and eye strain.","createDate":"1764216555","updateDate":"1764274437","approveDate":"1764216556","recommendations":14,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146920666","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8372082114219666}

I suppose this is synchronicity—I was reading about Saturn last night. I’m in the middle of ‘The Colossus of Maroussi,’ and just a few hours ago I closed the book before going to bed right after Henry Miller’s long philippic on the poor planet. He was detailing his impressions of seeing it through the telescope of an observatory in 1939 Athens: “When seen through a magnifying lens, [Saturn is] impressive to the layman in a way which the scientist must instinctively deplore and deprecate. No facts or figures about Saturn, no magnification, can explain the unreasonably disquieting sensation which the sight of this planet produces upon the mind of the spectator.” Miller then goes on—and on—to detail the particulars of his “disquieting sensation.”  I didn’t want to quote the full paragraph here because, well, it’s Henry Miller and chaste as this book of his happens to be, his reflections of Saturn are a bit depressing. But oh, so spellbinding, too, because, well, it is Henry Miller. If you’d like to read the rather long paragraph, I found it quoted in its entirety here in an archive of an old Seattle radio station: <a href=\"https://www.krabarchive.com/ralphmag/GH/saturn-miller-reading.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.krabarchive.com/ralphmag/GH/saturn-miller-reading.html</a> \n\nI wasn’t sure I was going to like the puzzle because the initial down clues across the top all solved like a Monday, but then Thursdayness happened, accompanied by really interesting entries in the rest of the grid—and I loved it.\n\nHappy Tofurkey Day, everyone!","createDate":"1764222689","updateDate":"1764306575","approveDate":"1764222690","recommendations":25,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146921234","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7399106025695801}

Step away from the table before your stomach explodes.\n\nRarely have I been so disappointed in a puzzle. This is entirely personal; as always, kudos to the constructor.

I have no idea what a square root is, let alone how to achieve it. \n\n I love crosswords for the language, the many TILs, the glorious discovery of different cultures and norms. Maths quite literally brings me out in a cold sweat, reliving childhood torments as one maths teacher after another told me I was stupid.\n\nI gave up once I realised I needed an element of mathematical knowledge. I couldn’t even understand Ms Kagan’s no doubt excellent column. \n\nThe NYT crossword isn’t constructed purely for me, I have no right to get upset just because the theme doesn’t work for me and I’m genuinely happy for all of you who derived pleasure from the grid. Unfortunately for me, even after all these many years, maths evokes a knee jerk reaction of anxiety and distress. I hope today’s teachers, of whatever subject, have a better understanding of the damage they do in belittling children who struggle. \n\nRight, that’s off my chest.

Had to think a moment about the logic of the theme clue. Realized that if the down answers were to make sense by squaring what was in the circle, I could not put the square in there already, because then I would be reading YEAROsixteenLORD. So I quickly took the squares back out early in my solve and just left the roots.\n\nSlightly disappointed to learn that both would have been accepted, because that renders the instructions nonsensical. But the editors try to be kind. On the other hand, I am surprised to learn that the numerals were not accepted, although I do understand why 24 or 39 would not have been. \n\nWhen NYT puzzles first went online, I was curious how they would deal with the rebuses. In the print versions, the answer key often had images for rebus answers. \n\nWhat first brought me to the comments a few years ago was spending over two hours trying to figure out how to preserve my streak when a rebus would not respond to anything I threw at it.

IT is metabolically active only in your lower gut, which is anaerobic. There are many others. \n\nFor those who claim this is too specialized or arcane: That is your non-science bias speaking.

A couple had math trauma so strong they would not even pick up a pencil during our sessions. I did not know how to reach them. Today, if I had the chance, I would use more manipulatives, concrete objects that let you see and feel what happens when you do something like square a number.\n\nPart of the crime here is aesthetic. I remember in high school getting marked down because I drew all my graph problems on a single graph, each in a different color, because I thought the combination of curves was beautiful.

And yet a poem, while not something I feel a great desire to unravel, doesn't fill me with anxiety and distress.\n\nAnd I think it's because mathematics at the school level is black and white, right or wrong.  There is no room for interpretation.  There is always a single answer, or a single set of answers, which are true, and everything else is false.\n\nIn literature, however, is not so black and white.  In high school English we read e.e. cummings \"Buffalo Bill's\".   I was a devout Christian at the time, and I took \"Jesus he was a handsome man\" to mean that cummings had momentarily stopped talking about Buffalo Bill, and was saying that Jesus was a real hunk.\n\nI said that, out loud, in class.  No one mocked me, as they should have.  No one scoffed, which would have been appropriate.  No one registered a bit of disagreement, although I was utterly asinine.  Even the teacher said, \"That's an interesting interpretation\", even though upon reflection I thought I should have been beet red for saying something so obviously stupid.\n\nSo I think you guys are onto something--there's something so final about math, and if I were as incompetent at math as I was a literature, it would have gone harder for me.","createDate":"1764267219","updateDate":"1764326244","approveDate":"1764267221","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146927507,"parentUserDisplayName":"Helen Wright","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146928552","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-27","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5808407068252563}
