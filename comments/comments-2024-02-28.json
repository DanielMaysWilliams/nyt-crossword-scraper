But it’s also a wow in how the answer to the theme’s riddle became clear to me.  First, I saw the obvious connection to HOKEY POKEY, then I oho-ed at seeing the IT connection with SCARY CLOWN, and finally I caught on to the I.T. link with COMPUTER SYSTEMS.  \n\nThus, rather than experiencing an explosive “I get it!” all at once, this cracking of the theme unfolded – yes, that’s the word – building, crescendo-ing along to a mighty understanding that felt mighty sweet and provided a long-lasting lovely aftertaste.\n\nThat was easily the highlight of the puzzle for me, buttressed by how Greg came up with three theme answers and a revealer that satisfied the requirements of symmetry in a grid.

He is incredulous at first but accepts upon meeting his  Lady-like \"wife\".  Other instances will be addressed below.\n\n2.  Marriage and the role of women\n\nThe play-within-the-play deals with courtship and marriage.  Four suitors pursue two daughters of Baptista Minola of Padua.  Katherine, the elder, is known for her sharp tongue and shrewish behavior.  She is regarded as \"Kate the cursed.\"  Bianca is known for the sweetness of her character and behavior.\n\nBaptista has made it clear that he will not allow Bianca to marry until Kate has been wed.  Surprisingly, he has not made them aware of that!  See especially Act II,Scene1 \"She is your treasure, she must have a husband.  I must dance barefoot on her wedding day.\"  See also I,1.58 \n\nThe suitors have different characteristics and reasons for wooing.  Two of them are citizens of Padua and are the only ones interested from the start.  They are Gremio, a \"pantaloon\", a term used by Shakespeare to describe the sixth of the 7 Stages of Man.   He is old and rich.  Hortensio is much younger and also prosperous.","createDate":"1709170841","updateDate":"1709170843","approveDate":"1709170843","recommendations":0,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131503794","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8992729783058167}

(Constrained by line limit)\nThe latecomers are outsiders.  Lucentio is a very young man come to Padua to study at the university and also to represent his father's interests.  I.1.194 \"Keep house, ply his book, welcome his friends.\"  His father is rich and known by reputation.  A comedic subplot involves producing a fake father to negotiate with Baptista. It is rich with persuasion, perception, and reality issues.\n\nAll of the suitors are \"gentlemen\", not nobles, but prosperous and known by their peers.  That includes Petrucchio.  Hortensio is a personal friend and Baptista had known his late father. Petrucchio has inherited the estate and is looking for a wife to augment family fortune with a handsome dowry.  He seems to be ready to settle down after years as a soldier of fortune.  I.1.199-205 including \n\t\"Have I not in a pitched battle heard\n\tLoud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets clang?\"\nThree marriages result.  Lucentio falls in love with Bianca at first sight.  They marry in secret and elope because her father has been tricked by the fake-father subplot and probably would not bless the union.  This represents the romantic marry-for-love motive.\n\n It should be noted that all of these three agreed to compensate Petrucchio if he were able to marry Kate.
