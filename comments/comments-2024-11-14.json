While the “TO” certainly does mean “bean,” the “FU” in TOFU is written with a Chinese character that generally means “to rot” (even though that’s not a truly accurate description of how the food in question is made, unless further processed).\n\nThe Japanese version of Wikipedia cites texts from ancient China (where both the food itself and the word for it originate) that suggest that the usage of “rot” is because dried soybeans themselves are hard both in texture and to digest, but (unpressed, unformed) TOFU is somewhat similar to what happens when stomach acid and enzymes break the hard, dried beans down into a slurry that is like how animal meat breaks down into a sludge when left to rot. This is pretty much the exact opposite meaning of “curd”/“curdle,” which describes a product/process where an additive (an acid or rennet, in the case of cheeses) causes something already fluid to coagulate into something more solid.\n\nThus, although “bean curd” is a perfectly accurate description of what TOFU actually is, it isn’t the literal meaning, either etymologically speaking or how anyone in the greater Sinosphere would perceive the word at a glance.","createDate":"1731595123","updateDate":"1731661770","approveDate":"1731595126","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137599348","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-14","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5484223961830139}

Now on to some of the other answers in the puzzle:\n\nLESS DRESS is \"red carpet attire\"?  Does that mean that nudity is the dressiest option of all?\n\nI first had siNK for the precipitous drop in the stock market price.  ALES forced me to change to sANK -- but the verb tense is wrong.  How can that be?  Oh, I SEE: it's TANK.\n\nLovely clues for BACKSEAT DRIVERS and JOBSEEKERS.\n\nFor those of us well-versed in rebuses, this puzzle was probably a piece of cake.
