It was also the most helpful for me in changing my \"contents of a drug shipment\" from PILLS to KILOS.\n\nMy least favorite and least understood answer was SKULL for the emoji that might be used in response to a funny text.\n\nI have a word for you if you're thinking of sending me a SKULL in response to my funny text:\n\nDON'T.\n\nWell, actually it won't really matter anyway.  I'm visually incapable of distinguishing one teensy little emoji from another: they all look identical to me.  But I never have the heart to tell anyone -- not even my own brother to whom I have never been anything but completely honest about everything else.  He recently seems to have developed this strange predilection for sending one single emoji instead of actually writing something in response to many of my emails and I don't know what he's trying to say.  Are they smiling or grimacing?  Is it always the same emoji? Could one of them possibly have been a... SKULL???\n\nTalk to me, Jimmy!!!\n\nNow back to the puzzle: My biggest problem was getting to Juno the SISTER when I wanted either WAVED AT or WAVED TO and never thought of WAVED HI.  When I finally got that, the puzzle was finished.  It was a nice Goldilocks Friday: Not too easy, not too hard, just right.","createDate":"1711718262","updateDate":"1711772680","approveDate":"1711718265","recommendations":16,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132180507","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-29","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7474752068519592}
