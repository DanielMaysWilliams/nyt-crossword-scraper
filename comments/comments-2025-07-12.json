The problem was my being 100% confident about iHAdABLAST. I understand WHOP but it's not a word that comes to me naturally, and I have no idea why \"Youth baseball supporters\" solves to TEES (any help, please? It's not covered by the column). Also, SETS confused me when I finally got it with autocheck on. To me, a set is not an area, but the stuff that gets set up on the area that is a stage... With the error in 1A, I didn't have enough crosses on the downs to solve HOME BREWER. I did get OBOE SONATA though. Is that a thing or a cutesy, crosswordese nod to our favorite instrument, the oboe?

Probably it's usually spelled with a \"C\" by astronomers, but I was unaware of that. So I stuck a \"K\" in there, then forgot that there was any uncertainty and thought that DISk was a sure thing.\n\nWhich left me looking at the answer to \"Detective, at times\" to be T__kER.

For the first part of what you say, for challenging puzzles it does feel a bit like a competition between the solver and the constructor, where the constructor tries to mislead you sometimes in an amusing and hopefully fair way, and you do feel a sense of accomplishment when you “beat” them. Nothing wrong with that. I hope I don’t make people who don’t like puzzles feel like they are just whining. I do like to point out when I feel specific criticisms are unjustified, like when they think an alternative spelling of “rigamarole” should not be accepted or if “absent” should mean missing an entire course instead of a skipping one class. And my personal opinion is that when a puzzle is fair and appropriate for the day it’s published, it seems unreasonable to say it’s an awful puzzle because it was too hard for you. I certainly wouldn’t think it was whining though to say I didn’t enjoy it because it was too hard for me, or I couldn’t finish it. Maybe that’s a fine line that some commentators cross on the wrong side.
