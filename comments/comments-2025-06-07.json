For me at least, a great puzzle has clueing that demands a balance of logic and knowledge.

It felt kind of tricky as I went through it, but I did finish it in a fair amount better than my average time for Saturdays.

I wasn't really successful and I didn't really care, so it didn't last long, but I still wore the heck out of that bad boy. Loved it so much! \n\nSo not knowing that or the chess term, I got it all through the crosses but I was stymied for a while by putting inA at 54 down instead of AHA early on.

They also have presences in the rest of the city.  A student housing district sprang up in the middle of the city because there was university-sponsored free busing to the main campus.\n\nThe NY state university system has about 64 colleges and universities, and the vast majority of them are in small cities and towns.  This is because in the vast number of cases, land was cheap, and budgets were tight.\n\nTOWN and gown conflict was not that big in Albany, which is a small city.

As a result of 19th century legislation intended to modernize higher education in the young republic, the US has many of its largest public universities located in areas that were rural (at least at the time of their founding). These schools had a much stronger focus on the sciences - especially agriculture - than the liberal arts. In most states, land-grant universities have become the flagship school of the state, and traditionally offered a strong education at an affordable price (don‚Äôt get me started on how that changed in the last 50 years). This means there are many large towns/small cities that are completely dominated by the local universities. They‚Äôre often the biggest employer, and the school‚Äôs population is large enough that students have a significant impact on local elections.
