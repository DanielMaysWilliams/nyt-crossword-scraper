Seminary graduate here. Let's talk about 9D. The Hebrew name for God is not Yahweh. In fact, the Hebrew name for God is unpronounceable and, frankly, un-writeable. It's why many Jews write G-d instead of God; as a former teacher at a Jewish Day School, I encountered that pretty regularly. It is signified in Scripture as the tetragrammaton, YHWH, which is generally spoken as Adonai, which in English bible translations usually appears as \"Lord.\" Yahweh is a Christian construction that forces vowel sounds into the tetragrammaton. The Latinized Jehovah does the same, importing the vowels of Adonai into the tetragrammaton. The Hebrew bible has many reasons for not rendering the name of God as utterable. So perhaps the NYT could respect that and simply clue YAHWEH as \"Weird Christian effort to make the name of God pronounceable.\"\n\nAnd yes, Deb, I too needed a refresher on how spoonerisms work.

In my sister's case, it seemed that someone suggested that everyone send her a set of salt and pepper shakers -- actually, she may have received a half dozen or so sets.

Spaight\nLet me make the argument against replacing the o in God with a hyphen. I can't speak for Xns but there is /no/ reason for Jews to do so. \"God\" is not one of the names whose use is limited for Jews. Those are all Hebrew words written in Hebrew characters. Anything in English characters is arguably completely outside the rule. The issue here would probably be pronouncing the crossword answer as written, although even there we have no belief that the inserted vowels in any way relate to the lost sound of the Name.\n\nFor most traditional Jews (I'm trying not to pick any specific stream within Judaism), \"God\" is just an English tag attached to a certain entity or perhaps even more abstractly to an idea. Substituting the hyphen doesn't change the referent. If you changed it to \"Gd\",  as some people do, it still bears the same referent.

Whereas in other religions, it is permissible to write any number of cusses or potentially racist words, despite them making people uncomfortable. Religious Jews would not (and did not) complete the puzzle, and it seems discriminatory, for lack of a better term, to include an answer that a group of people cannot type. \n\nAnd for the record, it's not merely offensive, it's deeply ingrained in religious Jewish culture that this word is not allowed. It is a significant sin, literally one of the 10 commandments. The discomfort presented isn't just 'write a word,' it's like asking someone to violate the Sabbath to solve a riddle. Sure no one is being forced to do this (although arguably if they only solve the across clues first...), but it's a slap in the face to be presented with it in so unexpected a place.","createDate":"1756438592","updateDate":"1756438594","approveDate":"1756438594","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144589068,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144620084","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-28","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5477445721626282}

They are. \n\nThe question is not whether you could include this word; it’s whether you should. \n\nI usually say that if it’s in the dictionary, it passes muster, but what if the clues were [Defecate], [Copulate], and [Woman’s genitals], and those answers were the three Anglo-Saxon words of four letters you must realize I’m referring to?  All three are in Merriam-Webster, but would you put any of them in a crossword?  \n\nWhat’s more, M-W’s definition of 9D is quite wanting. No one knows what full word ancient Hebrews used for God, since Hebrew, then and now, doesn’t normally show vowels in writing. Since the word was only spoken by the Temple High Priest once a year, after the destruction of the Temple the word was never uttered, and its true pronunciation forgotten. \n\nObservant Jews write YHWH or YHVH or the Hebrew letters yod-he-vav-he, and use it only in prayer and scholarly work, and never try to pronounce it. They speak to God using “Adonai” (my Lord) and speak of God as “HaShem” (The Name).  \n\nSome observant Jews would rather (and have; see Pax’s comment) quit the puzzle than write in 9D to solve the puzzle. \n\nI hope this clarifies things better for you.","createDate":"1756403540","updateDate":"1756434522","approveDate":"1756403541","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144601388,"parentUserDisplayName":"Daily-Solver","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144607628","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.835169792175293}
