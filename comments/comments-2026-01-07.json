Agree with Derek that whether Nancy Drew is a COVERGIRL because she’s on book covers or goes undercover (which she doesn’t, really) is a stretch. I took HELLOKITTY to be a female cat, which was a pretty wide field; she certainly looks like a CAT, and if you have to go deep into San Rio lore to prove she’s a girl that also a stretch. TINKERBELL was cute. The cleverest theme entry was ELLEWOODS which was completely ruined by spoiling it with REESE—no guessing or thinking about it at all. I appreciate fitting REESE in but just clue it as “portrayer of…” because Witherspoon is a gimme which just makes it too obvious. There’s also a lot of messiness given to ages; if HELLO KITTY is a human girl, she’s certainly not a LADY and categorizing DOROTHY as a QUEEN is also a stretch to make the theme work; she’s a PRINCESS at best. I’ll grant some cruciverbial license here or there for an otherwise tight or remarkable theme, but this was too much for too little, in my opinion.\nThe rest of the fill was definitely more Monday/Tuesday-ish.

Dorothy isn’t a queen, Elle isn’t noticeably a sister — if the character has a sister, it’s incidental to the story, and the actress who played her is certainly not a “sistah” sister. Also, the hyphens are unnecessary and misleading. Also no one I’ve seen in the comment section has a plausible explanation for what specifically makes Nancy Drew more of a “cover girl” than hundreds of fictional characters whose name appears in the title of their respective books, from Emma & Jane Eyre to Anna Karenina & Eleanor Oliphant. \n\n“Cat lady” and “Wing woman” are great clues, though.","createDate":"1767774391","updateDate":"1767856571","approveDate":"1767774392","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147840164,"parentUserDisplayName":"Derek","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147841946","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-07","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6655482649803162}

I make congee, with a mix of long cooked rice, and/or millet, for my wife who has a chronic illness.   It is really easy to digest, and is kinda a comfort food for her.  I gradually have come to appreciate it… a bit like oatmeal or cream of rice or cream of wheat.  The mouth feel after long cooking is kinda like soup but with less fat.  As a kid my mom would put savory stuff sometimes in cream of wheat, although we usually sweetened it.  My family growing up was utterly USA in food… lots of meat loaf, pot roast, green beans, chicken.  But no fast food.\n\nThen sometimes we now have the long stick doughnuts known as youtiao and dip them.  Like Mexican churros without the sugar and cinnamon.\n\nSomehow my wife is less likely to eat western food than I am to eat Chinese food.  Lots of Chinese vegetables that I’ve come to appreciate.  But she finds western food greasy, meaty, and often too sweet.  Her sisters are way more westernized… but her palate has stayed mostly Chinese.\n\nYou’ve triggered my memory of a restaurant named Warsawa in the North Berkeley gourmet ghetto near Chez Panisse, from 50 years ago.  We loved it but only could afford it a few times.  Chez Panisse was impossibly expensive and never had openings for reservations, except for a walk in pizza deal.  But you could just barely get into Warsawa with a few days advance reservation.

Virtually all our staples have plebeian origins, and all the quintessentially Warsaw-ian (is that a word?) dishes are low-brow, like flaki (tripe; flaki literally means guts). Of course, these days we have luxurious restaurants with menus inspired by Polish tradition, but it's not how 99% of us eat.\n\nCream of wheat, always sweet, is a Polish breakfast staple, especially for kids. As a kid I enjoyed it but only when it was really thick. Some people serve it very wet and not terribly sweet - to me it becomes horrid in that version.\n\nCooked rice flakes are traditional food for people with stomach ache in Poland, but again,we tend to serve them rather thick, and lightly sweetened, or flavored with some fruit, like apple.","createDate":"1767795197","updateDate":"1767796250","approveDate":"1767795197","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147846472,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147847113","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.48775264620780945}

He is perhaps one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time. The breadth of his mastery of the field is truly staggering. Here is a quote from one of his fellow Fields medalists, lifted from Wikipedia.\n\nBritish mathematician and Fields medalist Timothy Gowers remarked on Tao's breadth of knowledge:\n\nTao's mathematical knowledge has an extraordinary combination of breadth and depth: he can write confidently and authoritatively on topics as diverse as partial differential equations, analytic number theory, the geometry of 3-manifolds, nonstandard analysis, group theory, model theory, quantum mechanics, probability, ergodic theory, combinatorics, harmonic analysis, image processing, functional analysis, and many others. Some of these are areas to which he has made fundamental contributions. Others are areas that he appears to understand at the deep intuitive level of an expert despite officially not working in those areas. How he does all this, as well as writing papers and books at a prodigious rate, is a complete mystery. It has been said that David Hilbert was the last person to know all of mathematics, but it is not easy to find gaps in Tao's knowledge, and if you do then you may well find that the gaps have been filled a year later.","createDate":"1767797174","updateDate":"1767829845","approveDate":"1767797176","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147847740,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147848403","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7370602488517761}
