One example was: \n\nETHANALLEN crossing NATHANHALE\n\nA couple of others: \n\nOUTSTANDING/ASTOUNDING\nPISTACHIOS/POTATOCHIPS\nIRONAGE/GEORGIANERA\n\nDon't recall seeing another one like that.

I withdrew the (paltry) money and put it into an IRA when those came along.  I wish I could take credit, but it was DHubby who was sure it was a good idea.  That was about 40 years ago, and it was indeed smart.  (Later a Roth IRA was an even better thought.)  I'm now in the RMD phase, where I am Required to take at least some portion of the savings out (a Minimum Distribution) each year.  I ultimately re-entered the workforce after 20 years, but between miserably low pay and health iinsurance premiums, there wasn't much 'retirement savings' to speak of.
