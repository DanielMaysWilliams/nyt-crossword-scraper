Joint solve, so expected it. Nice layered solve for me - came together in about 5 passes. I like going through each across top to bottom, each down left to right, fill as many as I get then repeat each time filling in a few more. Piano, piano, as they say in Italian.\n\nGen-Z clue was new. The colonial homes were on hills, I thought at first before correcting it. Was surprised when I got the Altoids clue straight away, have I seen an ad for it? Dunno.\n\nOverall fun. When I went to post my comments I saw a mere 16 comments!! Many confused thoughts later realized it was still Thursday night. A first for me. Whew!

Beijing/Peking is a question of the transliteration of Mandarin, where 白菜 (the characters for the veggie in question) could be rendered, for example, as “bai cai” or “pai ts’ai,” if you’re using Pinyin or Wade-Giles romanization. “Bok choi” and “pak choi” are clearly borrowed from how those same characters are pronounced in Cantonese as well as Taishanese, Hakka, and other varieties of southern Chinese. (A syllable can’t end in a consonant other than ‘n’ or ‘ng’ in Mandarin but can in other Chinese varieties.)

However, a transcription of colloquial speech would have some differences in vocabulary and grammar. For example, in Mandarin and standard written Chinese, “I don’t have any money” would be 我沒有錢 (“Wǒ méi yǒu qián” in Mandarin and “Ngo mut jau cin” in Cantonese), but typically a Cantonese speaker would actually say 我冇錢 (“Ngo mou cin”), using 冇 instead of 沒有 to express “to not have.”\n\nSince the latter half of the twentieth century, there is also a distinction between traditional and simplified characters, following orthographic reforms in Mainland China. Simplified characters are used in the PRC mainland and Singapore, while traditional characters are used in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and among many overseas Chinese communities. “People’s Republic of China” is written as 中华人民共和国 in simplified characters and as 中華人共和國 in traditional characters. The distinction between the two types of characters is irrespective of dialect: a Mandarin speaker from Taipei and a Cantonese speaker from Hong Kong would both use traditional characters, while a Mandarin speaker from Beijing and a Cantonese speaker from Guangzhou would both use simplified characters. The differences between the two types of characters are larger than the differences between British and American spelling, but if you can read one then reading the other usually isn’t too difficult with a bit of exposure.","createDate":"1760117454","updateDate":"1760146445","approveDate":"1760117456","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145854602,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jacqui J","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145862948","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.841490626335144}

But we have, “[re-gridding] was a bit nerve-racking,” where ‘nerve-racking’ is a compound adjective modifying ‘it’ (re-gridding), the subject. \n\nAs to rack vs. wrack: These two verbs have been etymologically and semantically entangled almost since their inception, to the point that English can’t cleanly separate them anymore.\n\nRack descends from Old English reccean, to stretch out. Think of the medieval rack—the kind of stretching that was done in the Tower of London.\n\nWrack comes from OE wræc, punishment, misery. As the consonant cluster ‘wr’ reduces to just ‘r’ as Middle English evolves, however, by Chaucer’s time, wrack sounds the same as rack, although the orthography has fossilized. The meanings of the two words start intertwining in spoken English, and wrack also becomes a verb meaning to ruin, destroy, rip apart. And don’t get me started on wreck and wreak which also enter ME from OE  wræc—sort of… There are contemporary similar, but not identical, meanings of the these words entering ME at the same time from Old Norse and Old Dutch, having evolved from the same Proto-Germanic root but under different circumstances. \n\nGood Freyya, I love medieval England (et insulae). \n\nHopefully I get to finish this in the next comment.

But the conductor has to decide, as do soloists and (collectively) chamber musicians.\n\nAnd yes it gets confusing as meanings change over time. Notably Andante, literally \"walking\", was viewed in the 18th century as a 'fastish', moving tempo, which made Andantino, \"a bit Andante\", a bit slower; but by the 19th century and into the present Andante came to be viewed as \"moderately slow\", making Andantino *faster* than Andante. Got all that? Brahms even seemed to change his mind on this in the course of his lifetime, and already in the 19th century musicians complained that nobody knew what the heck Andantino meant. Some of these things are still actively debated.\n\nMeanwhile Lento sort of exists outside the standard Largo-Adagio-Andante-Allegro-Presto scale, and just means sort of generally \"slow\". So it doesn't really compare readily with other markings.\n\nFinally, of course all tempos are relative and subjective, and highly dependent on the written note values (8ths, 16ths, 32nds etc.), so the metronome ranges printed on metronomes or in the Wikipedia article are largely meaningless.","createDate":"1760103854","updateDate":"1760137597","approveDate":"1760103855","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145851877,"parentUserDisplayName":"joel88s","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145856217","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-10","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5024013519287109}
