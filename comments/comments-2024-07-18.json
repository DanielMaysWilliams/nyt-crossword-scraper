Doing Frank A. Longo’s Friday puzzle of January 23, 1999, I had it all filled in, but the lower left corner was nearly blank. I had one entry and three letters in the link to the body of the puzzle and nothing else.\n\nIn that part of the grid, the top and left are both easily googled facts, and a third answer joins that list. The temptation grew stronger to just look those three names up - or even just one of them - to give a foothold in that quadrant. It was my decision to make: google and move along, or continue to think about the other answers until something dawned.\n\nAnd it did dawn, and the answers came. The last square I filled was a guess (a good one, it turned out) at a crossing of two of the names.\n\nTL;DR — Resist the urge to look things up.

But here's what  still puzzles me:\n\nIs there any logical basis for those links from the top-row answers to the particular down answers they link to? I.e., why do the first two criss-cross—a nice visual symmetry— leaving the third one to link up to an answer at the bottom of the grid? Am I missing something in the particular geometry? \n\nIn terms of the actual fill, is there any connective significance to those two long down-answer phrases?  I gather not.  (As a pair, they certainly do not seem to link up to the starry answers across the top of the grid.)\n\nSure, I know that all clever crossword puzzles are going to have some arbitrariness, no matter how brilliantly they are laid out.

The idea starts with Einstein, who theorized that space and time are not only equivalent to one another, they can also be bent or distorted by gravitational fields.  He also showed that nothing can travel through space-time faster than light.\n\nIf space and time are can be distorted, there may be a way to use this distortion to travel between places and times  to different places and times without going through regular \"undistorted\" space.  In this way, we could effectively go faster than light.\n\nHigh conjecture, but an amazing tool for science fiction, which always runs into the problem of how we can cross such vast distances in a manner timely enough to sustain a story.  Stuck with the speed limit of light, it would be very difficult to have any sort of meaningful travel to, or communication with, different solar systems, let alone different galaxies, where the distances increase by a factor of at least a hundred.\n\nI'll send you $50 dollars if you're still reading at this point.","createDate":"1721324899","updateDate":"1721628312","approveDate":"1721324902","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134764150,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134770459","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-18","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6513620615005493}

I’m a Thursday Crossword lover and this one was a little bit different and worked the Synapses. I was a bit too focused on getting crosses to solve the long theme answers to notice the celestial openings of the portal across the top but it was a nice Aha moment. I was wondering if it was a rebus but the downs didn’t require two letters so I left them blank until the end. I also hit a speed bump in the SW with the proper names. I had Gag gift at first but I know my French ports and that got me out of trouble. Love the group of assets clue. \nI think solving is fun because I enjoy the combination of wordplay, general knowledge and code breaking.

I'm not sure why so many commenters get their knickers in a twist about this stuff.  Anyone in the least familiar with the Indianapolis 500 (and I probably qualify as \"least familiar\", never having paid it much attention and never having watched any of the race) knows that \"Gentlemen, start your engines\" is part of the lore. Everything these days seems to be a hot button for some people to gripe about, but this is just cultural literacy, as much as the meaning of a \"No Vacancy\" sign at a motel, although I haven't seen one of those in a while.\n\nThe point is that once you realize that there's something going on with the first row entries (and duh, the circled letters, people), and the unclued down entries (hey, they also begin with circled letters), it's simply a matter of working through the grid until your Aha! moment arrives. And trust me, it does. I just stumbled along until it did.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, scream your head off about it.
