I fought the impulse to solve the grid but not take the extra step of figuring out the theme (and this was before I'd actually fully solved the grid!). Taking that extra moment gave me extra satisfaction when the \"a-ha\" hit -- and helped me with the last of my fill. Eventually. (I see I'm not alone in having the middle top as the last to fall! For me, blame that on acidic vs. ACETIC.)\n\nHowever, I have to say there was some pretty shoddy editing on this grid! The outright error at 10A that got changed around 7-8am Eastern -- literally from one pass to the next for me -- from [Meas. that becomes a third of its size if its third letter is removed] to the correct [second] letter. Then the \"troublesome\" 40D (as @Bill in Detroit calls it, and many other comments have pointed out). And while some have rationalized [Paris boulevard] solving to RUE, I'm firmly in the camp that a Paris boulevard... is a boulevard! \n\nFor the record, 10A held me up a fraction; I got 40D immediately from having ER and not considering etymology; I plunked in RUE without hesitation but with a big eye roll. If it hadn't been for 10A, I probably would have just sighed and moved on... PINKY swear! \n\nThanks, Adam!

Some cities replaced their walls with boulevards, others with parks. For example, the old town of the historic Polish capital Kraków is surrounded by the wonderful Planty park - laid out in the 19th century when the medieval and early modern fortifications were largely demolished (However, the medieval barbican remains intact, an extremely rare relic of military architecture). By then the city had been fortified by the Austrians (who ruled there then) using mid-19th century technology - a ring of brick forts with earthworks surrounded it.\n\nInteresting fact: these mid-19th century forts quickly became obsolete, too. In most places in Europe such fortifications were demolished within decades of their construction, to be replaced by an even more modern iteration, utilizing reinforced concrete rather than brick. In Kraków, however, they remain - one of few such examples on the continent.\n\nMore on Wikipedia:\n\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Barbican\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Barbican</a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planty_Park_(Krak%C3%B3w\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planty_Park_(Krak%C3%B3w</a>)\n\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Fortress\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Fortress</a>","createDate":"1744275335","updateDate":"1744355951","approveDate":"1744275337","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141309980,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steph","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141311407","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8807407021522522}

The populists of the PiS party (the irony of the name in English is brilliant) can always count on about 30% of the vote.

The turnout in the 2023 elections was record-breaking: over 73% (in the past it had usually been ca. 50%), with some districts achieving over 90% (I'm proud to live in an area of Warsaw with some of the country's highest turnout, and lowest support for the populists). With how the Polish proportional electoral system works, the 30% support for populists can translate to either 30% or even as much as over 50% of the seats in parliament. A unified front of the opposition, and the support it could rely on, meant a defeat for the populists.
