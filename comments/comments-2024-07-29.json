As you know, the TriOkraThon was introduced at Rio in 2016. Athletes from around the world competed in the three-part event (eating okra, obstacle course covered in okra, swimming in okra). Americans, from the Ozarks to NYC,  have taken to the sport of okra to such an extent that in just a few years the pickleball courts have been largely abandoned for the okra pits (regulation size 167 x 82' pools of stewed okra, 12.5\" deep, with ladders, slides, flues, barbed wire, slabs of concrete, hidden panels, etc.) where you'll find legions of okrathletes of all ages, drenched in okra, in friendly but serious competition. \n\nSo far in Paris we're just in the eating stage. The Omanis took the early lead, using huge discs of pita to scoop up vast quantities of the gooey mass. The crowd let out a gasp when the Italians, who had prepared a huge cauldron of a warm, bubbling, greenish-brown okra ragu, couldn't finish. \"After a certain point, I told myself 'enough is enough,'\" said the captain, \"and my teammates felt the same.\" He made a hasty escape, heading for the bathroom.\n\nBut it was the French, with their grand gruyere & okra omelet, who won the day. Little by little, they ate the 21-metre omelet. What of the Americans?

Anyhow, a fun puzzle, in which I filled out almost the entire grid in one full round of a crosses and downs.

I'd put AYE aye on the first go round, so no happy music, but easily fixed once I actually looked at it.\n\nAnd once again, if you're not good at geography, I'll give a plug for playing a geography game. The one I do is just simply called World Geography and it has helped my crossword puzzling so much! Two years ago, I would not have known OMANIS.
