Nice shoutout to Simu Liu!\n\nI understand the MAXIMUM/MAXIMUS debate and lateral symmetry thing. Some in the comments state that MAXIMUM is more symmetrical due to the matching start/end letters, but answers like MAUIHAWAII and MAMMAMIA have suggested it is more of a phonetic rather than lexical symmetry. MAXIMUS feels more apt to me as MAXI and MUS ends on a softer syllable, just my opinion. ABYSS has been in NYT puzzles multiple times in recent history too, so ABYSM does seem like a cheeky curveball to keep things interesting :)","createDate":"1713936409","updateDate":"1713972214","approveDate":"1713936412","recommendations":5,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132753792","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.563575804233551}

With the revealer highlighted, all the vertical theme answers will be in yellow and they will be readable in the mirror as normal. Further, none of the other vertical answers will appear normal. Turn the mirror around and repeat on other half of the puzzle. Ross Trudeau had a similar-minded puzzle on 1/17/2019 entitled “Through the looking glass”, which was the revealer running down the central column. Five theme entries spanned the “mirror” and they were all palindromes. In that puzzle the theme entries ran horizontally and the individual letters were not themselves vertically symmetric.","createDate":"1713990641","updateDate":"1714022222","approveDate":"1713990643","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132763881,"parentUserDisplayName":"David Connell","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132771408","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-24","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8243075609207153}

I noticed that the theme answers were symmetrical in terms of the vertical series of squares matching each other in the grid, but then I kept looking up and down (which wouldn't be lateral, duhh) and not seeing symmetry. Anyway, it didn't impede the solve, and even though I've never had calculus I did tweak that last square to an 'M' when I thought \"hmm, maybe ABYSM is a word, like chasm or paroxysm or antidisestablishmentarianism,\" and then MAXIMUM made much more sense than MAXIMUs, which sounds to me more like someone from a gladiator movie.\n\nI got LIMN but probably while uttering something that sounded very much like it (\"erm\", hrrrmm, lummmnn, glurm, limmmn\"), ANYWAY it was fine.

MAXIMUM sounds mathy, while MAXIMUS sounds, well, Roman and ancient, and would not be anyone's first choice for a math context.\n\nBut if you solved horizontally first, you almost surely entered ABYSS, which was wrong here.  But so right otherwise.  It was a cross that seemed impeccable, so if you didn't think to check, you wouldn't think twice about it.  And if you did check cursorily, you'd see MAXIMUS and say, hey, that's a word.\n\nAnd since the vast majority of people either never knew anything about calculus, or have spent their entire adult lives trying to forget about it, even if you had checked, you might not have noticed anything wrong with MAXIMUS (unless of course you knew what the theme was and realized it was a theme answer).\n\nBut if you solved down first, you might not have even looked at ABYSM, since MAXIMUM is also a solid answer.\n\nI might also suggest that adding \"poetically\" to the ABSYM clue could have helped a bit, since it's only Wednesday.\n\nSo I think that's why so many people were upset with this cross.
