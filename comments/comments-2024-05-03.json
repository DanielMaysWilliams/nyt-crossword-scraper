Props to the Knicks and their trio of former Villanovans, especially Jalen Brunson.

While the northeast corner was tough (the clue for 3D might have specified beer rather than beverage, but I get it, Jake, it's Fridaytown), as the long entries DEADTREEEDDITION and ANHEIRANDASPARE took shape, both 2D and 3D could be worked out with the other crossings. \n\nPETPSYCHIC was fabulous. And Syd BARRETT has been on my mind lately because I'm somewhere around episode 157 of Andrew Hickey's marathon podcast A History of Rock in 500 songs, which just covered the birth of Pink Floyd, and the particular sadness of Barrett's disapperance from public life at age 26 after leaving the band. Indications are that he was quite a bit along the Asperger's-Autistic spectrum, and the self-medication and heavy experimentation with psychedelics certainly wasn't helpful in his case.\n\nAnd the double stacked GASSTATIONSUSHI, combined with THISISANOUTRAGE, was just genius. Eli Cotham, I think you have a bright future. You're a natural, not to detract from the hard work that goes into these efforts.
