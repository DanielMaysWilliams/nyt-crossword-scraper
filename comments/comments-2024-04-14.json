Just - wow. Really memorable* puzzle and amazing feat of construction. \n\n*But for me, also one repetitive reminder of my memory problems. Even after I finished I've had to go back and look at it over and over again to be able to recall exactly what was going on there. Was REALLY surprised to be able to finish this one successfully. Sometimes better to be lucky than good. That's all on me - this is just one wonderful puzzle. \n\nOh... and answer history search today was inspired by ROE. That's been an answer 658 times and couldn't help but wonder how often it had been clued with 'Wade.' Well - 42 times specifically and a few others with a roundabout reference. \n\nAnd... ROEVWADE has been an answer 5 times, though the first time was in 2017. \n\nI'll shut up now. \n\n..","createDate":"1713095555","updateDate":"1713155234","approveDate":"1713095557","recommendations":20,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132532235","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8358597159385681}

Sadly for me, I did not figure out the before/after part of the theme until I read the column.

I also didn't have a problem with any of the \"after\" entries, other than PORE at 75D, for which I kept acne for quite a while. I was quite slowed down by keeping ups instead of DHL at 37A and capital instead of OTTOMAN at 24A. When it came down to the wire, I had to remove it because I was pretty sure of CORPOREAL. A few tough crossings for me led to just a few lookups—can't wait to someday go a whole week without lookups! \n\nMy favorite was CHINA SHOP for \"A bull market it is not!\" \n\nEATS IN / EAT SIN reminds me of Fargo Season Five... Ole Munch. I love that show and it was an excellent season. The last episode and final scene just blew me away with its grace and strange beauty.

As is my habit, initially I skipped the themers, until I had enough crosses to begin to grasp what was going on -- and then with MALL SANTA/ALL'S, I saw it. Whew! Now I knew to solve the themers by setting aside the \"before\" and \"after\" and focusing on the clues. It was still slow going!\n\nI find it a little surprising that some solvers felt the paired answers made the puzzle too easy. Having uncovered the theme's rules, it was nice to be able to use that understanding *in both directions* to help finish the puzzle -- and it still took some doing! Like an earlier commenter said, I couldn't unsee adMIT ONE, even though it didn't totally jibe with a coupon... And I had already forgotten how to spell WHAC-A-MOLE after its prior occurrence. Whoops! \n\nPlus, in a puzzle this size, even solving the themers still leaves plenty of other tricky fill! I had ALANIS immediately, only to remove her. (I was less certain of ELWAY, but did the same there, too.) Favorite clue was \"A bull market it is not!\". \n\nThanks guys!!","createDate":"1713185811","updateDate":"1713590634","approveDate":"1713185813","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132548555","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8435546159744263}
