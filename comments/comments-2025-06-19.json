I enjoyed figuring out the theme and completed the puzzle without lookups. But as others have said, and probably many more will say, the theme clues were backwards. If you're going from something to something else, then the from would be what's already there and the to is what it gets changed to. (GUTTER changes to GRATER, but the clue says RA to UT.)\n\nMost of the fill was very easy for me. In fact, at first I thought it was way too easy until I got to the PERETTI/TAIO/PARADEREST/CLE business. Of course, I was thinking handler like most everyone else, but ruled it out because of several crosses I knew for sure were right. \n\nSo, I just started changing letters until I got to something that seemed to make sense. TAIO seemed like the most likely name since I already had the I and O. PaRETTI sounded like a good Italian name. With no idea about the sportsball team, CLa seemed just as good as anything else. And PARADEREST, which I'd never heard of, made sense when I stopped thinking about a person's role and figured it might have something to do with RESTs in music, which is where you don't play anything.\n\nBut ... No finished message. So I ran the alphabet on the first letter of TAIO. Nope. Changed it back to T. Started to flyspeck the rest of the puzzle and found I'd put rIB instead of BIB for Chest Guard. Still not done.

(That's the plural we typically use in normal writing, but in some contexts, OCTOPODES or OCTOPODS  would be appropriate; but only the most annoying pedant who is trying to flex their pedantry would use those in normal speech or writing, and they're generally used to apply to the entire clade of OCTOPUSES as a group.) \n\nOh -- and in the culinary world, I believe OCTOPUS can be both singular and plural, similar to how the  plural of FISH can be FISH or FISHES, depending on how many species are in the pan/catch/whatever. \n\nCome to think of it, biologists also use the same algorithm to pluralize FISH, but I don't think I've heard biologists apply it to OCTOPUS.","createDate":"1750352508","updateDate":"1750383367","approveDate":"1750352509","recommendations":17,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142966250","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-19","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8614595532417297}

Frustrated because I was so sure GUTTER was right, and didn't know the comedian or singer and that whole section was toast.  Eventually had PERETTI as a guess, because I figured the intermediary had to end in an R and had TEST PREP and ITTY.  But erased it again.  When I finally looked up Chelsea and put it in with more certainty, remembered TAIO Cruz, and ended up with PETSIT.  I then looked at TSTORM again - and the penny finally dropped.  Truly amazing puzzle work - I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been to create this!

Clue and answer for one of them: \n\n\"Word chain #1 (12 wds., coming full circle)\"\nHOUSEPARTYLINEDRIVEWAYSIDEKICKBACKHANDOVERNIGHTCOURT\n\nAnd it did come full circle. The first part- an across: \nHOUSEPARTYLIN\n\nbut at the N it turned down. And that line was:\n\nNEDRIVEWAYSIDEKICK\nbut that was a down answer. And then at last Letter -K, it turned back to the left so that section was; \n\nODNAHKCABKCIK\n\nSo the implied there was that in reverse: \n\nKICKBACKHANDO\n\nAnd the last one went back up to the beginning letter of the first one, so the implied answer was:\n\nOVERNIGHTCOURT (going up).\n\nAnd the other theme was on a 'square' setting inside that first answer. The actual implied answer was:\n\nBOATYARDARMCHAIRPOSTROADSHOW\n\nBut of course it followed the same pattern as the first one going... across, and then down, and across to the left and finally up. \n\nOdd one.

But apparently, 'octopi' is now acceptable even in authoritative dictionaries (makes me wince too).  It seems that enough people make the same mistake – even as in this case it demonstrates appalling ignorance of Latin and Greek –  it can become part of the language;  just as meanings change through usage. `Newt' and 'nickname' fall into the category of ignorance which is now perfectly acceptable, albeit for a different reason; while 'decimate' (also makes we wince) and 'nice' (at least it retains two meanings) fall into the latter.  That's the nature of the English language:  having so many speakers spread worldwide, it is bound to be fluid, so we just need to tolerate ignorance as part of the evolutionary process –  until the next generation, precious few of whom will have been taught the rudiments of etymology, let alone Greek, Latin, Old English, Old French or old Norse,  give it no further thought.\n\nWhen someone answers my question of  \"How are you?\" by \"I'm good\" I like to retort with \"Good to hear that, but I was not enquiring into your state of piety\".

I I wouldn't've minded the \"no hint\" part had there not been so many Naticky spots… & a few too many proper names a bit obscure for a Thurs tricky theme (I love tricky themes, but plz don't load up an esp tricky one w/so many naticky gluespots please). With proper names & even acronyms it's YMMV— I might be brightly \"Oh, Toscanini!\" & snag on some other fill, one of you might brighten up w/\"Oh that's [some author]!\" & snag on Toscanini. STILL, I really do think this was naticky.\n\nTheme was kinda nice, but whether it needed hints or simply fewer adhesive spots I dunno… I think my hitting on E SHARP finally broke the impasse of stubborn whitespace that wouldn't go away. A lot of grumbling throughout tho, not many aha's, more \"OK I guess it works\". Parson for BISHOP, & a dog could be SOAPY ShAkY or, yep, SulkY (& SilkY afterward!). Not a lot of joy for me in this one. Nice to finally catch on to the theme & break thru & finish, but I don't think it sang.\n\nAnd the \"meh's\": STALER. ARRAY. ODES. MIKE (I only see \"mic\"). SEAT/SLOT/SPOT. RIB before BIB. TOETAP (an \"EXERCISE?!\" I dislike the clue). Teddy bear a TOY? Not doll/ stuffed animal? I guess it's a toy. Like a hot dog is a sandwich…\n\nSERRA? TAIO? BMXBIKE? TESTPREP? sigh.\n\nAnd… WETTEST? Really? Green paint is even wetter…\n\nTo me this really wasn't elegant. I always respect a constructor's effort but that's my honest IMO. Made me grumpy solving it.
