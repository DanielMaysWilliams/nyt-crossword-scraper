If I picked up my cat (fittingly named Tony) at the spa, I'd take one look at Tony and say \"What happened to your paw? You're missing a 'w'.\"  And Tony would go to his cat psychiatrist (\"Catshrink\") and say, \"Dr. Melfi, I had a terrifying dream that all my paws got their w's cut off and I could never get a TOE HOLD: what does it mean?\" \n\nAnyway, back to earth: a really slickly put forth theme. Nice to see PRO BONO. I'm pro Sonny Bono, and will tolerate Bono (although I won't ever forgive U2 for irreversibly loading their stupid album \"Songs of Innocence\" onto my old 2014 Mac, it was so jerky and desperate). I am at peace with the cluing of ACROBAT because I don't think of them as bending out of shape, but simply bending into new shapes. But I figure that whatever original shape acrobats are, once they start doing their thing, they have bent themselves out of that shape. Still, the clue may be a little TOO CUTE. \n\nAlso \"BOHO PRAIRIE\" may well be the fashion trend you'd spot in Palo Alto. Remember Jeff Bezos in his asinine cowboy hat after he flew around space in his silly phallic fantasy? That's prime Boho Prairie. What real men wear. Men with space ships.\n\nAll praise for Levine & Mason filling in for the missing 3 amigas. Stunned that Everdeen blanked on Alec - he's an xword staple as Obi Wan!
