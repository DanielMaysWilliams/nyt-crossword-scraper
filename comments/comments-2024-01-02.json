I’ve read many of your comments, and you clearly are very intelligent, so I think that tactic is beneath you. \n\n1) He may have liked the overall puzzle….I never said he didn’t\n2) quibble is a polite way to say complaint, even if the word has a context of being a small compliant, it is still a complaint\n3) were there some that posted about it being easy? Yes, but a bunch also said harder than normal. Knowledge and experience is individual, and he was saying that because it was easy for him, the NYT should make it harder. In addition, the comments section is dominated by expert players.  The beginners representation in the comments is I’m sure lower than the overall percentage of people that do the crosswords. I know you are smart enough to acknowledge that. Mondays and tuesdays are not targeted to captainquahog’s skill level, just like saturdays are not targeted for my skill level. \n\nWhile my sarcastic and admittedly passive aggressive response was a cheap attempt at humor, i will own that….it was entirely accurate and had an important point embedded in it. Perhaps I’m not the one that needs to pause and reread before criticizing?","createDate":"1704334770","updateDate":"1704406134","approveDate":"1704334772","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130179770,"parentUserDisplayName":"CaptainQuahog","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130208238","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-02","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5514506101608276}
