This is the man who once took an ordinary answer – HELMET – and made it extraordinary through his clue [Knight cap].  Today he did the same with RENT (clued “Number for a letter?”), GREENHOUSE (clued “What has a lot of room to grow?”), and NONS, (clued “Negative Nancy words?”).\n\nThat last one is SO clever.  Sure, punning on the French city Nancy has happened aplenty in crosswords.  But here, Paolo beautifully misdirects, because a “Negative Nancy” is a thing, like a Debby Downer and Doubting Thomas.  So, Paolo’s clue double hides the Nancy pun – brilliant!\n\nFun to see ARCANA hiding in EAR CANAL, and lovely to see the gorgeous phrase TIME AND TIDE.  \n\nGood vibes all around.

Yes, I know the squares are numbered, but on my tablet the numbers are generally quite small, especially in the larger Sunday grid. Don’t get me wrong: I did enjoy it for the most part but maybe in the future the editors and coders (I assume there are coders) could take the issue of colored squares into account.\n\nI did, however, chuckle at 81 A [BLACK] OLIVE, because of the mild arguments about it as a pizza topping on Friday.

It was big! I too had issues w/barely seeing where I was in the puzzle cuz of the depth of color in the \"rings\"… my workaround (not having a stone tablet nor a bigscreen) was to use >arrows< to skip to next or previous clue, keeping my eyes on the grid, & I'd then kinda see which the 'current' word was. Not easy, & sometimes had to toggle back & forth to see it, but still worth it.\n\nI imagine if they'd used lighter, pastel colors instead of these deep tones it mighta made their MEANING more, uh, opaque— i.e red might seem pink, yellow➡off-white, etc… as it was, I wondered if grey MAGIC was a thing, but you CAN'T have squares be black. Yes someone above suggested maybe NYT coulda used black squares w/white font— which sounds kinda cool— but even if easily doable tech (who knows) I think patches of jet-black squares for the FILL (near black squares which AREN'T 'fill' squares) would just be even MORE confusing. So all in all I think it was— at least subjectively, esp w/my gimmick ro kinda flush out the \"current\" word— worth it.\n\nI hadn't thought of turning off overlays, great option to know of (& once the color 'theme' dawned, even w/only greyscale one could scribble down a list of where each color ring was, to help in the solve).\n\nOverall I liked it, my mild irritation at the 'puzzle' of \"where the heck's the cursor!\" being at least sorta mitigated by my toggling < > to help see where the #!%$# in the puzzle I was. >>cont'd>>>","createDate":"1722196935","updateDate":"1722296965","approveDate":"1722196938","recommendations":8,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135027460","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7634676098823547}

Oddly enough, I got stuck on the “revealer” clue, which I kept returning to OLYMPICring instead of the real answer.

You couldn't simultaneously know WHERE you were and WHERE the cursor was GOING. But [#QuantumHumor] the clues put us in a good 'position' to crack the theme, and many folks got good 'momentum' with this celebrative Olympic-sized pool of a puzzle.\n\nBut on to the PUZZLE itself, not just the tech…\n\nI really liked the \"AHA!\" when I FINALLY copped to the color theme. This was when I was P-O'd at the editor/constructor for a 'bad' clue/entry at 60A, GIANT (ha, usually that's a clear tipoff that I'm just not 'getting' a scheme/theme/gimmick and the clue and entry are just fine). \"It's not GIANT\", I groused to my phone. \"It's GREEN Giant. There's NO WAY it's just GIANT. They can get away with LUCIA sans SAINT and other malarkey, but it is DEFINITELY GREENGIANT!! *goes into \"Frasier\" character 'Bulldog' mode* This stinks! THIS IS TOTAL BS! This is— oh wait. Got it\" \n\nFrom there on in it was me revisiting all the unfinished entries in the colored rings, and it was a big grin.\n\nI think this was a fabulous puzzle, even if we all had to be a bit of a MacGyver to work around the undiscernible location of where we were at any given time… but the overall puzzle?

With just grey (all the same shade) it is not clear at all what is going on or even that the shaded squares form five interlocking rings.\n\nI got RING BEARER  pretty quickly, but FRODO BAGGINS was one letter too long for 114a 🤓. I soon figured out that colors had to be prepended to the shaded answers, and then soon after that realized it must be an Olympic theme. Though not knowing which five colors were used in the Olympic logo or the location of those colors added a little more guesswork. It was super-fun to figure those things out as I worked through the puzzle. I love a puzzle within a puzzle, and without ever seeing the colors (until I turned overlays on after completion) I got to enjoy that extra challenge. 😊\n\nAs a result, my experience solving this puzzle was a 10 out of 10.

When they (eventually, I hope) add disc golf to the summer games, I would definitely watch the YouTube videos.","createDate":"1722189047","updateDate":"1722369199","approveDate":"1722189049","recommendations":5,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135025478","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-28","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5256567597389221}
