Apparently despite appearances (poduszka - pillow; pod uszka - under little ears), \"poduszka\" has nothing to do with ears or being under them. It comes from the protoslavic verb \"poduchati\", meaning to blow or inflate. \n\nAlso, even though in this case Russian and Polish use the same vocabulary, it happens much more rarely than you would think. I understand very little of Russian, or any other Eastern Slavic language, even though I know the Cyrillic alphabet. In fact, even though I never learned French, I understand more of it, especially in writing, than of Russian.\n\nPolish is a Western Slavic language. Of those, Slovak is most similar to Polish, in my experience. In the mid 1990s as a teenager I went on a guided tour of a castle in Slovakia and I understood surprisingly much of what the lady was saying.

Actions - and inaction! - have consequences.\n\nI never tried learning any other Slavic language. I have always thought it would be super difficult - so similar to Polish, in general, but different in every detail!\n\nI have a passable understanding of Romance languages, especially in writing, I suppose mostly because of how much French influenced English. I also learned some Latin in high school, which probably helps, a bit, but my Latin vocabulary is very limited so I wouldn't overestime its importance.\n\nI haven't heard of the Plimseur method.

I am a bit of a rube, especially given my parentage (I come from quintessentially Eastern European intelligentsia), and I try to keep somewhat fit, but I am far from buff. \n\nMy maternal grandmother, born in 1925, spoke French, and it was part of her persona. She was a somewhat tragic character, forever scarred by a tough childhood in the 1930s, after her father, the scion of impoverished gentry, abandoned her and her mother, and then got himself killed in 1939. She spent some time in German during WW2 prison and saw some horrible stuff there. All of that desensitized her. My mother never experienced any affection form her, and neither did I. She was cold and aloof, and even though she mostly lacked intelligence, she thought herself better than everybody else (especially my country bumpkin father, despite his rather illustrious academic and public service career). Speaking French was one of the elements of her fake refinement. Actually, one of the reasons I never learned French was to spite her.\n\nThe more I write about these things, the more I'm tempted to publish an essay or a book, maybe, on my Polish experience, as told by a dozen ghosts - my grandmother's, mother's, best childhood friend's, Jorge the Lab's, etc. It might be interesting.","createDate":"1762552607","updateDate":"1762586524","approveDate":"1762552608","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146495145,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146496068","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6818616390228271}
