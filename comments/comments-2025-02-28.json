Aias gets himself into a snit, and plots to murder Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Odysseus. But the gods step in, cloud his sanity, and he slaughters a couple of cattle instead (not to mention the herdsman of said cattle--but he's just a Trojan farm-worker, so doesn't really count). In any case, still believing that he had, in fact, killed his fellow Greeks, Aias is overcome with remorse, which drives him to suicide. In his poetry, Sophocles makes some rather elegant puns on \"Aias, whose very name speaks mourning!\" (\"Ai! Ai!\")\n\nSo, Professor Lyons, do I pass?\n\n*ColgatePalmolive manufactures several different varieties of Ajax¬Æ cleanser: Ajax¬Æ Powder Cleanser, Ajax¬Æ Ultra Citrus Scent +Salt, etc.: a well stocked grocery or hardware store will stock many Aiantes¬Æ.","createDate":"1740750896","updateDate":"1740830979","approveDate":"1740750897","recommendations":22,"replyCount":11,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140172216","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.76373690366745}

So if you are like me, if you finish below your average time, you might still finish more than half the puzzles faster than that time. We still don't get a median finish time for our own puzzles on XW stats, but it's a good bet that your median time is faster than your average time. \n\nXWstats seems to bear out the idea that this was a relatively easy Friday, with 74% of solvers finishing faster than their Friday average and 40% solving \"much faster.\" \n\nFor me, however, this was not the case.

Your description of it sounds quite wrong.\n\nSuppose a runner is on first base.  If there is a high fly in the infield, the runner can't run because he can't leave until the ball is caught.  If he did, when the ball is caught, it can be thrown to first base and the runner is out.  That's two outs, the batter and the runner.  \n\nWithout the infield fly rule, the fielder can simply drop the ball.  No outs yet.  Then he can throw the ball to second, which is a force out on the runner.  Then the second baseman can throw it to first to try to throw the runner out.  That would be the second out.\n\nSo an infield fly with a man on first could very easily be turned into two out, instead of just one.  So the infield fly rule is the batter is automatically out, so the fielding team can only get one out.\n\nIt takes a long time to describe and explain, but it is perfectly reasonable to have the infield fly rule when there are base runners that are forced to advance on a batted ball.","createDate":"1740774902","updateDate":"1740829606","approveDate":"1740774903","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140185120,"parentUserDisplayName":"Peter C.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140186913","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7372301816940308}

If there is just a runner on first, there is no infield fly rule in effect, because none is needed. Should a fielder allow the ball to fall, he can indeed throw to second and get the force. But any well-trained batter runs immediately after hitting the ball, and so easily reaches first base before the throw from second, so no double-play.\n\nLong ago, when I was a clever second baseman, I would sometimes intentionally allow a ball to drop in the setting, but only if the batter was a much slower base runner than the runner currently on first.

Thanks for setting me straight.  I still seems to me that if *should* apply if there is a runner on first.\n\nThe reason is this.  The infielder can catch the ball and there is one out and still one on at first.\n\nHowever, if he purposely drops the ball, he'll absolutely be able to get the man on first before he can get to second.  They *might* be able to get the batter getting to first as well.\n\nSo dropping the ball is a sure one out, and a possible two out.  Catching it is only a single out.\n\nSo I guess you're right.
