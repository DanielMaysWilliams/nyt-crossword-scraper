(“Um … so?” “But don’t you see — two distinct terms so different in meaning  but with the same number of letters!!!!” [*backs away slowly*])\n\nAnyway — really liked this puzzle. In an ideal world I could have done with fewer names, but the sparkling long entries more than made up for them, and the two crossings that I suppose are, technically, Naticks (ADLER/RIDE and BADU/JEAN) were easy enough to suss out — for me at least. And while I was suspicious of RAWR, sure enough it seems that it’s one of those things kids say — or text — these days. At least that’s what Google tells me. \n\nThanks Hemant for a nice Friday.","createDate":"1705066726","updateDate":"1705112017","approveDate":"1705066728","recommendations":21,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130408355","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6454170942306519}
