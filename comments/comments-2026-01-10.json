The long crosses were \"thinkers\" - I particularly liked ATTACK MODE and the the theme of oaths (DAMNDEST, OHCRAP) with the \"Darn It!\" clue right in the middle.\n\nI also love this puzzles for its lack of dull fill. Life got busy this year, and as I've been catching up on the 2025 archives I've felt like some of the easier (Tuesday/Wednesday-esque) puzzles have a new abundance of dull fill. My least favorite are all the \"quote\" clues (like today's \"what a cute outfit\") - there are so many ways to say phrases that these synonym quote clues, of which there were only 2-3 this puzzle, can get really unfun. They aren't really either logic or trivia, they're just placeholders to me, and some puzzles have 5+ in a single grid. Making them longer, like today, makes them more fun, but they feel like mostly excuses to get nonwords into the fill, like SONICE, or OHYES, or IMIN. This puzzle had so little of that - it was tight and really well put-together.","createDate":"1768060120","updateDate":"1768071196","approveDate":"1768060122","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147943092","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-10","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5194534659385681}

I was excited when I saw the byline. My last fix was YmCA to YWCA like many others. I figured out Andrew MELLON from going to the Ulster American Folk Park when we were in Ireland a few years ago.

I highly recommend visiting it if you find yourself in Ireland. I knew FRIEND OF DOROTHY as well from my career in HR/DEI. We had employee network groups that I was in charge of and that was a common phrase used in our GLAFNET (gays, lesbians and friends network).

I get “Yes, Mies van der rohe is extremely famous and considered one of the most important and influential architects of the 20th century,” in edition to a wide array of newspaper articles, museum summaries, encyclopedia entries, Reddit threads, youtube analyses, academic articles – and on and on, recent material and not.

Our relations are a bit like those of the ancient Romans and Barbarians - us being the latter. The Czech culture is much more Germanic than Slavic, and us truly Slavic Poles don't vibe with Czechs much (which I regret, as a Germanophile and very unusual Pole).

I never thought of bib as you did. Actually, I find the idea of wearing a bib while eating bbqed food disgusting, somehow. The feeling is very visceral, but if I were to speculate where it comes from, I'd say there may be two reasons. (I'm going to lose points with SBK again, but my need to speak the truth is simply overwhelming 🤣). First, babies wear bibs when eating, and as a babyphobe I just can't stand the sight of them drooling and food dripping everywhere. When I'm at a restaurant and there is a small child eating in sight, I'll switch seats with my wife so I don't have to look at it. Second, needing to wear a bib at a BBQ implies the person intends to eat like a boor, squelching, belching, etc. Eww!

This is why I felt comfortable crossing them. The reason we call things “Naticks” is specifically because of a town, Natick, that no one from outside of Massachusetts has any reason to know.
