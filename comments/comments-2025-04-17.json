I think they’re afraid of Greek and Latin references, which is too bad since language matters here. \n\n@Nora et al.:\n\nThe Wikipedia entry under “lotus tree,” uses Homer’s lotus as an example because it (lazily) uses a 19th c. dictionary citation. I checked: The latter uses Pope’s translation of The Odyssey. Pope took a lot of liberties in his (very beautiful) translations: What he calls a “lotus-tree,” Homer simply calls “lotus” (lōtós), and nowhere in the context does he suggest it’s a tree. \n\nNow, that doesn’t mean that the lotus tree is mythical. E.g. Strabo mentions “lotus trees” with some frequency (dendra lōtoús), Athenaeus writes of the “tree-like lotus” (lōtós ho déndrinos) and Pliny the Elder, drawing on Theophrastus and Herodotus, and ever the fastidious botanist and ethnographer, clearly describes the lotus tree as opposed to the marsh plant: \n\n“In Africa, lotuses also grow which are like trees…”\n\nvs.:\n\n“There is also the Egyptian lotus, found in marshes, similar to the cyprus but with broader leaves. It has its own pleasant flavor when imbibed, and its root is sweet…”\n\nAs @Nora writes, the lotus tree definitely exists, although it’s probably not what Homer had in mind. \n\nNow Ovid, on the other hand… But this is already too long of a post.","createDate":"1744884729","updateDate":"1744935218","approveDate":"1744884731","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141494012,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mr Dave","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141494730","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-17","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5083635449409485}
