There were too many answers that didn't make sense even after they were revealed. E.g. 19 across (marked, as a box): XDIN... The answers are supposed to be accessible to the general public, either through research or recall (once they \"hit\" you). I got that the answer was \"exed in\", but there's no way a person could double check \"X'd in\" because it isn't even common shorthand for \"exed in\" (it exists as the name of an engineering firm, and that doesn't connect to the clue or the answer at all). The creator and editor assumed that everyone would just recognize it/accept it as valid, but I've never seen it shortened that way, anywhere, ever. That answer wasn't clever- it just came across as lazy to me.\n\nAs for 41 across (metal detectors?): ICHINGCOINS; I enjoy abstract concepts and niche subjects in crosswords but this was neither. That answer was too much of a reach and didn't connect to the clue. \"Coins= metal\"- great- but I Ching isn't a translation of or a homophone for any word that means seeking OR finding, so to simply put it there in front of \"coins\" makes no sense. If a person knows of the I Ching and how it's used then the answer makes even less sense. The clue gave no indication that there was a book involved in the answer, nor did it give a hint as to which direction one should search in. If someone has never heard of the I Ching before, how are they even supposed to know WHAT to look up or double check?","createDate":"1720049563","updateDate":"1720367583","approveDate":"1720049566","recommendations":8,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134400327","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-03","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.72283536195755}
