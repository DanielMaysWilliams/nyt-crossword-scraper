They both have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale. \n\nFor more detail, quartz is a mineral, and it defines hardness of 7 on the scale. Quartzite is, in modern geology, metamorphosed quartz sandstone, so a metamorphic rock. Quartz sandstone is sandstone made up almost exclusively of quartz grains, plus quartz cement in varying degrees, so a sedimentary rock. (Quartz sandstone is called quartzite sometimes, but that's not currently cool, and only muddies the waters.)\n\nIf you take quartz sandstone and squash the heck out of it, you wind up with quartzite. Squashing it, though, doesn't change the hardness of the quartz that both rocks are made of. Squashing gets rid of the holes and recrystallizes some or all of the quartz grains, but it's still quartz, and the hardness of that is 7.\n\nCountertop manufacturers are known to exaggerate. \n\nIn case anyone wants a better example for 28A: like graphite vis-à-vis diamond.

First of all, quartzite (a rock) is made up of fused quartz (a mineral) grains. It's the same stuff. Second, hardness is a mineral property defined as resistance to scratching. You can't apply to a rock, although you can apply it to separate mineral grains in a rock (in which case, see my first point). Third, you might argue correctly that quartzite is more resistant to breakage than quartz, because the fused, interlocked grains stand up better to crushing. But that property is not called HARDNESS; it's  TOUGHNESS.  So, [Like quartzite vis-à-vis quartz] is a misleading clue for HARDER.\n\nA more interesting pair are diamond and jade. Diamond resists scratching much better than jade (so it's HARDER), but it fractures much more easily than jade (which is extremely TOUGH).","createDate":"1769200832","updateDate":"1769256052","approveDate":"1769200832","recommendations":15,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148318512","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6038033962249756}

I too find hesitation in opening up the Thu-Sun puzzles.  \n\nI’ve noticed that feeling pessimistic about the puzzle is correlated with longer solving times.   \n\nI did only Mon. and Tue, new and from the archives, for about 6 months… Sep- Apr 2025.  Since Apr. back to all 7.\n\nRecently I’ve been working backward through the 2025 Thu-Sun, Apr, Mar, Feb… just yesterday got really stuck on a Feb. Fri.  Was convinced I’d never get it.  Decided to just open it once every day for a while and stare at it.  The 24 hour time for completion is long past, just going for a blue star.  \n\nIt worked… one day one word in one stubborn corner came to me, couple of days later another word in another corner just came to me.  Got it done in about 90 minutes on the crossword clock.\n\nSo I tell myself, like on today’s Friday, which at first review, I could fill in only about 5 words, that I for sure I will complete it, if I put it down and out of my mind a few times… that 100% it will all come clear to me.  \n\nI visualize leaving my gnawing doubt off to the side before opening the puzzle.   I was sure BarROOMEYES was 22 D (line from For You Springsteen song) then after going away for an hour and reopening BEDROOMEYES just stared back at me and I fixed it, and suddenly that part of the puzzle filled.\n\nFinished in 45 minutes on the crossword clock today… with a couple 1 hour gaps.

They share (I am sorry to say) with surgeons the delusion that humans are like tinker toys and if I can just twist this one piece over here back into place, everything else will fall back into place and all will be well.\n\nBut humans are very complex and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I recently read about the idea that \"More is Different.\" That every time you introduce something into a complex system, everything realigns. So you need to look at everything and not just assume that, if you didn't change it, it will remain unchanged. I suppose that this is to avoid another basic problem -- the Law of Unintended Consequences.\n\nSo my advice (not that you asked) is to flip a coin. If it's heads, do today's puzzle. If it's tails, do the Sudoku or make some homemade bread or get a haircut. Call an old friend who lives far away and say, \"Howyadoin, kiddo?\" Stare at the snow through the window for 15 minutes. (No cheating, use a timer.) Or, if you must have words, read a book. Try Thomas Mann; he seems to be in the air now.\n\nBecause it's just a game.\nPS You don't always have to obey the coin either.

Both are what we call native minerals, which means you can find each mineral lying around, not just in rocks with other minerals. It's made of sheets of carbon, bonded (covalent?) in a honeycomb pattern, which are stacked and bonded by weak van der Waals bonds. \n\nI had to look up graphene, interesting stuff. Graphene is a single layer of graphite. It's the isolation of these layers that makes them useful, and Nobel-prize worthy. The physicists isolated the graphene using graphite and adhesive tape! I remember reading about that.\n\nSo to address your question, yes, graphite is a mineral, and graphite is made of layers of graphene. So I guess graphene is a structure, not a mineral in the geologic sense. We can't really give it a hardness, cuz it's only one atom thick, and hardness is a physical property measured by scratching one thing against another. Geologists start backing away when you get to the molecular level.","createDate":"1769246237","updateDate":"1769246238","approveDate":"1769246238","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148323460,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nora","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148327046","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6630306243896484}

You can call meatloaf a steak if you want, but that doesn't mean I am going to pay $50 for it in a restaurant. \n\nI looked up both materials. It's a sea of conflicting claims. Quartz countertops are quartz (hardness 7) mixed with other stuff, like resins (hardness <7). Not sure what quartzite is, the photos show all kinds of countertops that are clearly not the rock quartzite. This is true for \"granite\" countertops, too. Saying a countertop has a hardness of 7-8, when the hardness is 7 at best, is marketing. Garnet is the only mineral that I can think of that is both harder than quartz and reasonably present in a giant slab of rock. Garnet isn't rare, like topaz and sapphire, but it's not going to be a dominant mineral in a countertop. When it comes to countertops, apparently you can claim just about anything, which does make them useful for a crossword puzzle. \n\nAnd I'd like to draw your attention to the first two words of my original post: nit warning. For me, there is tension between crossword puzzles, with giant gray areas, and science, which is the constant search for definitive answers. The tension makes it fun, but also occasionally leads to \"well, shoot, that's not true.\"","createDate":"1769249576","updateDate":"1769249578","approveDate":"1769249578","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148322751,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nora","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148327195","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-23","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6285625696182251}
