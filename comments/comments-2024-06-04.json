Part of it is his ability to come up with entertaining themes. Jeff Chen, who has collaborated with him on three puzzles, lauds Daniel’s ability to “theme-storm”.\n\nI loved today’s theme because, just like yesterday’s, it provided an extra solving challenge – figuring out the revealer before uncovering it.  I’m bad at this, so I work extra hard to get better at it.  Yesterday, I didn’t correctly guess the revealer but I did find the BOARD connection between the theme answers.  That was a huge woo-hoo for me.\n\nToday, once again, I didn’t guess the reveal verbatim, but I did see the connection in the theme answers, that they were things not to touch.  Well, holy moly!  My small steps are inching toward medium steps!\n\nJeff Chen also said that Daniel’s prime aim is to “serve the solver”.  That is, he’s looking to entertain, to provide a terrific riddle to crack – not trying to show off.  \n\nWell, Daniel, you certainly served me today – I loved this puzzle.  Thank you so much for making it!","createDate":"1717501517","updateDate":"1717587352","approveDate":"1717501520","recommendations":22,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133668991","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9398314952850342}

Much older than your place, it was constructed in 1919, seats 4500, and is one of the few remaining ballparks in the country with a wooden grandstand. At the time it was built, no one gave much thought that games might ever be  played at night, so the diamond is oriented due West. The only other professional park in the U.S. that faces West is  Sam Lynn Park in Bakersfield, CA. They often suspend games when the sun begins shining directly at the batter. The very first intercollegiate baseball game was played between Amherst and Williams in Pittsfield in 1859 and in 2009 the two teams played a reenactment with vintage uniforms in Wahconah Park. There was a nice tribute piece by Daniel Okrent in S.I. in 1990 linked below which describes some of the joys of watching this level of baseball in stadiums like this.\n\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2ahsvp8z\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/2ahsvp8z</a>","createDate":"1717532577","updateDate":"1717572595","approveDate":"1717532580","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":133670387,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"133681876","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-04","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6231142282485962}
