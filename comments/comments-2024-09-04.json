Once 63A was filled in, it all became clear. The rebuses (rebi? reboids?) were reasonable -- only three of them, and they read the same across and down. No lookups! The Beatles and Tina FEY are in my comfort zone, as are MARCEL Duchamp and the ELAND. The clue for 11D suggested \"midwife\", so the answer was not a huge stretch (so to speak).

Those who have access to his link should specifically look to see how early week, esp. Wednesday, rebus puzzles differ from those on Thursdays. They often, as today, have a single rebus repeated a few times.  The last time I remember this actually happening on a Thursday was the infamous “Escape Room” puzzle of 3/21/2024, where ESC appeared in four squares. There was in fact howling about how it was too easy for a Thursday, and remember Deb’s infamous column that day comparing that puzzle to (a better) one from 13 years ago. In the comments, Lesley wrote in lamenting that the 4 rebus squares were not somehow designated…BA responded that they are almost never marked.  He’s right, of course, except on non-Thursdays like today. A great Wednesday rebus puzzle today, and so much criticism could have been avoided if Sam had run that Escape Room puzzle on a Wednesday….\n‘","createDate":"1725466797","updateDate":"1725544775","approveDate":"1725466801","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":135932126,"parentUserDisplayName":"Shawn","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"135938407","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8699325323104858}
