I had to turn autocheck on to get anything in the middle, and even a couple of the other clues would not come to me no matter how hard I stared at the crossers. \n\nParticularly hard for me were NEGAWATT, BAL (and sadly, I live in Florida), and OCHS. I did not get those until I gave up near the end and started entering vowels until the letter turned blue. \n\nOther lowlights:\n\nWhat on earth does NIT have to do with scratching your head?\n\n\nI have no idea what a madrasa is or why ISLAM would be covered in it. \n\nWhat the hell is a NOB, and what is its relation to bean or noodle?\n\nDoes TCBY even exist? The only one I know of closed down when I was a kid, so that one was especially dastardly because I also had to iterate through letters to get it. \n\nRAMA LAMA DING DONG was too hard to get the specific letters if you couldn’t get the crossers. I kept thinking of the other stupid nonsense song that goes something like, “Oooh, eeee, oooh-ah-ah, ting tang, walla-walla-bing-bang,” so that one was especially difficult without knowing the right reference. \n\nSTN is almost always abbreviated to STA in the crossword, so that didn’t help with NEGAWATT until I turned on autocheck. \n\nMASALAS makes sense, but crossed with too many hard-to-get words. \n\nNo idea who Juliette LEWIS is. \n\nMYMAN wasn’t coming until I turned on autocheck. \n\nDitto ASANA.

I liked the puzzle - even showed the person next to me at lunch, who is not a puzzler, the trick.  But ...\n\nIn Mendon, MA, there's a place called Southwick's Zoo. It's a not very small zoo in the woods that has been there for 60 years or so, and it's a really neat place. I would go to it when I was a kid, when it was called Southwick's Wild Animal Farm.\n\nWhen you walk in and down to the intersection of a few walking paths, there's a little white shed with a few steps on either side that lead to little windows in the shed walls. Around the shed are signs proclaiming that the Great Red Bat, which can be seen in the shed, is a dangerous animal, no pictures, etc.\n\nSo, when I was little and saw the shed for the first time, I was really excited to see the bat. I walked up the steps, peeked in the little window, and was struck by two emotions at the same time - bitter disappointment because all that was in the shed was a red whiffle ball bat hanging from chains, and delight at the word play. But mostly disappointment.\n\nShed's still there, at least last time I went maybe 8 years ago, when I introduced my son to the bat. Also disappointed.","createDate":"1706839587","updateDate":"1706977641","approveDate":"1706839589","recommendations":14,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130881428","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6106846928596497}

Too bad that there seems to have been some technical difficulty in rendering it for the mobile screen.\n\nI raise my eyebrows at a few of the clues/answers: in particular, \"TCBY\" for \"cultured dessert option\" at 27A is a business I've never heard of, maybe simply because of regional specificity or coincidence, and the lack of an indication that it was an initialism threw me for a loop (ha). Is it because it's the name of the business that the initialism isn't clued? In either case, it felt like a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlso, \"THREEPIO\" at 36D, while not too hard to get from the clue, is as others have pointed out both an abbreviated and non-standard spelling of the character's name which stood out to me as a little \"messy.\" \n\nI felt in the end that the execution of the looping gimmick was prioritized over the elegance of some clues/answers. A notable exception was SETTLE/METTLE which several others have mentioned - this got me as well and struck me as very clever. Overall I enjoyed the puzzle and thank the constructor.","createDate":"1706812135","updateDate":"1706859970","approveDate":"1706812137","recommendations":7,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130871908","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.37853389978408813}
