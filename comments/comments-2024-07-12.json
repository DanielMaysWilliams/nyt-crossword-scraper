When one doesn’t know an answer, especially if it’s a word one has never come across, it requires the brain to make educated guesses from whatever letters that have been filled in from crosses.  “Does this answer seem possible?  Could it fit the clue?  Will it work with surrounding words?”\n\nThus, the brain becomes super involved, and I don’t know about you, but my brain adores this.  Savors this.\n\nToday’s puzzle brought several such answers – all long – transporting my brain to nirvana.  These moments of sweet labor were complemented by some glorious swaths of splat-fill.\n\nAlong the way were some beautiful answers – HAND PICK, KUGEL, NO NONSENSE. There was also an impressive original clue for EEL, a word clued hundreds of times in the major outlets, but never with a “continental shelf” angle. \n\nVery happy brain, with loveliness on the side – yes, a slam-bang experience.

POST MALONE; OPAL; ASHANTI; KAT; CRAZY STRAWS.  And AMERICANOS, as clued.  I thought that drip was a method of making coffee and AMERICANOS are a kind of coffee.  But then I don't know my AMERICANOS from my ESPRESSO MARTINIS.\n\nQuestion of the day:  How can you make an ESPRESSO MARTINI with those non-coffee ingredients?  When I go back to read the comments, I'm sure some one will explain it.\n\nBut, wow, Malaika, your cluing is great!  It's tricky, it's always completely fair, and it does the thing I most want clues to do -- which is to provoke curiosity.  Loved the clues for ISN'T (11A); EUROS (8D); STRIPE (42A); MENUS (45A); DIAL (38D).  You've taken simple, ordinary words and made them special.\n\nMy subway had a gAP at first.  You're always being warned to WATCH THE GAP, so I'm always watching the gap -- which keeps me from ever looking at the MAP.  But then it's pretty hard to get lost on the Lexington Avenue #6 line -- even for someone like me with no sense of direction.\n\nI'm sort of glad I didn't know any of those names, Malaika.  It made the puzzle far more challenging and far more fun for me than it would have been for the many younger people who probably did know them.  And I didn't even have to cheat.

I loved the wordplay. The clues were fun and I enjoyed all the aha moments.  I did the west side of the puzzle with less angst than the east.  I had so many ways to solve that shrinking, crashing clue! Crosses ended the struggle. Lightbulbs went on rapidly on the SW corner as soon as I solved 67A. Guessed successfully AI clue and worked my way back up for a few more passes. Once I swapped out twang for drawl it was Katie bar the door!  Thank you Ms. Handa and NYT for a fun Friday morning.

If one orders a coffee, for a couple of soles or Ecuadorean sucres, one might be presented with a cup of hot water (or milk) and a cruet of a dark, syrupy liquid called *tintura* or *esencia de café*, which one mixes in to taste. In a good establishment, this will be sweetened, super-strong espresso; in poorer ones, it will be a concoction of sugar and instant coffee. Nescafe sales are big down there.","createDate":"1720791689","updateDate":"1720848086","approveDate":"1720791690","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134616865,"parentUserDisplayName":"Bill","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134620931","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8071672916412354}
