To plead our case I was asked to submit a trove of emails .  At the NLRB hearing I was asked why my two bosses (not the targets of the investigation) repeatedly called me Vlad in the emails when it was clearly not my name. I had to explain to the PTB* that my middle initial is V, and I was a big fan of Buffy (the vampire slayer). I quoted the show often at work (come on, it remains eminently quotable: \"could you vague that up for me?\" remains in heavy rotation) and I would often say things like \"well, what would Buffy do?\" or \"Giles would have handled that differently\" or \"that's exactly what Cordelia would have said\". So my nickname became Vlad The Impaler--amusing in a very small group of workmates, but difficult to explain in a hearing. :\\  So thanks for listening.\n\n*Powers That Be","createDate":"1708406747","updateDate":"1712866727","approveDate":"1708406749","recommendations":33,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131278419","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-20","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7140885591506958}

Like okay, sure, but are NYT crosswords only to be solved by people who have solved 544 other crosswords? What about us newbies, I guess tough luck with our crossword struggles then? Jeez.\n\nThese comments aren’t helpful and to be honest come across a bit smug. The other day someone said they weren’t buying the (hundreds of) complaints about done unusually tough crossings because some of those words had appeared so often in previous crosswords. I guess we all conspired across the globe to complain on the same crossword then. \n\nTo be clear, not saying all crosswords should be easy necessarily, I’ve certainly learned a ton over my 78-day-and-counting streak so far. But some of these complaints are legitimate as evidenced by the number of recommends many of them get, and a little empathy or kinder guidance from more experienced folks would help a ton. I mean that’s why we come here to comment anyway, right?

The clueing was a stretch on multiple entries (NERTS, really?), and some just plain wrong (Jung, SSGTS). The advent of Google has not been a friend to crossword creators and solvers alike, as I'm convinced it makes it easier for creators to find any feasible clue for whatever mess of letters may be left in a tough spot, no matter how obscure. Creators should abide by the same unwritten code of honor that solvers live by...if you used the internet to create (or solve) a crossword, it's not a true win. Some might disagree with me on this, but you know it's true ;-)  Anyone can Google their way to a gold star completion.\n\nAnd for the \"Stan\" answer, I'm young enough (or old enough, depending on perspective) to remember when this song came out. I had the album, and am very familiar with the song. Still didn't get the answer, because it was a bad clue...plain and simple. The thought that it might be \"Stan\" crossed my mind for a split second due to the cross answers, but then I said to myself \"no way they'd reference a 24-year old obscure song without any reference to Eminem, music, or even a question mark.
