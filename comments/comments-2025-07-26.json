In Polish it's simply called \"przedszkole\" (preschool, which functions in English, too). The place for even younger kids is \"żłobek.\" The word has an interesting etymology. It is related to \"żłób\", manger, as in the trough for animal feed. Żłóbek, literally \"little manger\", is where baby Jesus slept. Linguists assume żłobek as a term for Pre-K arose out of the biblical story. Also, for some more Polish trivia: żłobek is pronounced slightly differently than żłóbek - the thing over the o matters; we pronounce \"o\" as you do your \"o\" in bog or cog, whereas our \"ó\" is your \"oo\" of boom or book.","createDate":"1753502697","updateDate":"1753587713","approveDate":"1753502697","recommendations":38,"replyCount":34,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143813188","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-26","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6930952668190002}
