How could a puzzle that is by women, about women, and features woman-centric clues (even the colleges selected for 41D are women’s colleges!), be anything but a celebration of women? I think any offense found in certain words is there only if you want it to be.\n  \nRandom thoughts:\n-My interpretation of the revealer was more in line with something someone might think after completing the puzzle: “I saw a woman (’s name) in half” rather than someone actually being bisected.\n\n-Did anyone else put in TLC for 45A’s “crazy, sexy or cool” clue? Just me? OK.\n\n-I enjoyed the nostalgic callback to Melanie’s Brand New Key, a fun and cheerful little ditty that is definitely not about roller skating!\n\n-@ Katie, I was thinking about your word pairs list from yesterday when trying to decide between Sierra Madre or Leone.\n\n-I was very disappointed when “arsonist” didn’t fit for 39A… but very pleased on the second pass when PYRO did!\n\nI really enjoyed this puzzle.

She was actually burned when she \"vanished\" from Munchkinland in that dramatic fiery cloud, and some of that copper was permanently embedded in her skin.

That it took 2 people to create, plus the NYT editing team, is pretty extraordinary.\n\n1. The theme - I won't say \"offensive\", but just poorly done. I'm amazed it made it through the selection process. It's supposed to be ironic and self-chastising with \"missus, babe, dame\" probably, but I strongly suspect it's actually just the best crumbs that the constructor and editors were able to come up with. But, I genuinely paused before entering \"babe\"... not only is it the most offensive/ridiculous in a public context, but also it's often used by women to refer to men (their friends/boyfriends/husbands especially or, maybe mostly in the UK, as just a common way to refer to any male friend).\n\n2. So many clues trying to be cute/clever/different but ending up just ambiguous or misleading; a few that stood out to me most: \n- AWOL is an adjective not a noun\n- \"Globular regalia\" should never appear in print ever, ever again\n- Abhor = hate; writing it 3 times with an exclamation mark is just confusing, like, what are you trying to convey that couldn't be conveyed with just \"hate\"?\n- Why is E.T.A. \"informal\"? It's an abbreviation for Estimated Time of Arrival\n\nI won't continue, suffice it to say I was not on the same wavelength here.\n\nI have to sign off by saying thanks for the puzzle - it's very difficult even to make a mediocre one, and I appreciate it in spite of everything.","createDate":"1741823908","updateDate":"1741866381","approveDate":"1741823909","recommendations":8,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140529345","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-12","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7804850339889526}

The audience is having its heart strings tugged because there is a risk to the woman.   With a man....they might just want to see him actually cut in half.\n\n\nThe whole key to many of these tricks is being able to contort into a position where the cutting implement isnt.

With the standing cutting blade illusion there is lots of black painted space on the side which can hold a skinny person and be no where near the blades.

Rearticulation could be plucking/bowing strings or tonguing/taking a breath between notes. A similar thing exists for playing two of the same note, but it's called a tie instead of a slur. If you want an auditory example, listen to the beginning of Pilot's \"Magic\" (the one they use in the Ozempic commercials): the first 'ohs' are all distinct notes, but when they sing the word 'know' they connect the pitches together.","createDate":"1741830122","updateDate":"1741848409","approveDate":"1741830123","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140521560,"parentUserDisplayName":"RJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140531374","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8136776685714722}

In music, a slur is changing a note without rearticulating. For example, on a bowed instrument, you change notes without re bowing. On a guitar, you change notes without re-plucking a string (some are called “hammer ons” and “pull offs”). You use your fretting hand to change notes without re-picking with your other hand. I suppose a slide or bend on a guitar is a slur as well, as long as you don’t re-pluck in the middle of it. I have no idea how it’s done on a wind instrument.
