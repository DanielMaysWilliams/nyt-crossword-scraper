ROCK N‚Äô ROLL indeed. \n\nA fun fact: The reduction of ‚Äòand‚Äô to ‚Äòn‚Äô  English is about 800 years old, both in pronunciation and writing. Prior to that, the ‚Äòd‚Äô in Old English ‚Äòand‚Äô (also found as ond, endi, or und) was always voiced. We know this from OE manuscripts, where it was never shortened to ‚Äòn‚Äô or ‚Äòa/en‚Äô but rather written out (unless replaced by the Tironian et (‚Åä) symbol, the precursor of our ampersand (&)), as well as from how OE poetry reads, where the ‚Äòd‚Äô in ‚Äòand‚Äô has to be fully voiced with an alveolar stop or it breaks meter. \n\n(Additional fun fact, that voiced ‚Äòd‚Äô is about 3 millennia old, with proto-Germanic andi/unda dating back to the Bronze Age.)\n\nBut then comes Middle English, and ca. the 13th c. scribes start writing ‚Äòand‚Äô as ‚ÄònÃÑ‚Äô or ‚ÄòenÃÑ.‚Äô (I‚Äôm using apostrophes here to denote italics. The apostrophe as a typographical way of denoting elision in speech only enters English in the 16th c. as printers adopt the Greek ·ºÄœÄœåœÉœÑœÅŒøœÜŒøœÇ or apostrophos or turning away. Before that, a macron over the ‚Äòn‚Äô indicated elision.) So we now see phrases such as ‚Äòale n wyn‚Äô or the medieval version of SURF N‚ÄôTURF, ‚Äòfysshe n fleissh.‚Äô \n\nThen we have 17th c. ale ‚Äôn‚Äô cakes, then19th c. kiss ‚Äòn‚Äô tell and, finally, rock‚Äôn‚Äô roll. And then advertisers drop one more apostrophe to make it all more visually pleasing, and now we‚Äôve got our rock n‚Äô roll and cookies n‚Äô cream. \n\nBut we‚Äôre not such a long way from the 13th c. and ‚ÄúOf mete n drynke he had gret nede.‚Äù","createDate":"1760936097","updateDate":"1761027011","approveDate":"1760936098","recommendations":45,"replyCount":15,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146050351","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-20","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7090447545051575}

It‚Äôs where your Indo-European language-speaking brain expects a few anchor points‚Äîsome shared morphemes, sounds, stress rhythms‚Äîand gets none, so it flags the environment as non-intelligible territory. If you have a musical ear, you subconsciously notice when the melody of speech feels alien, lacks familiar prosody and phonological rhythm. If you speak an Indo-European language‚Äîor if you‚Äôve traveled a lot, or just usually choose subtitles vs. voiceover on Netflix‚Äîyour brain is used to picking up recurring morphemes and syntactic cues. Then you get to Budapest or Riga or Helsinki‚Äîand there aren‚Äôt any. Hello, vertigo. \n\nYears ago, my husband and I rented a car in Istanbul. We hadn‚Äôt been together long enough yet for him to be exposed to anything but this Germanic language of ours, plus his high school Spanish. And then suddenly there was Turkish. I remember his reaction when he realized that there was nothing, zero, nada that he could communicate to the hotel maid. And then at seeing familiar road signs with words that had no resemblance to anything he knew. \n\nHe did learn some Turkish. To this day, he yells ‚ÄúDur!
