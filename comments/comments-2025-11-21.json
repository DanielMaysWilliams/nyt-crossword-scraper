In the end I broke down and looked up INES, and I also had to do an alphabet run for the crossing of the sitar composition and prized people.\n\nI really liked many of the clues, the one for CESAREAN and RIB being prime examples.\n\nThe misdirect for the one who was totally taken by Paris was great. I actually entered Emily first, but instantly had an epiphany and changed it to HELEN. \n\nKnowing common crossword entries of HORAS and RIRI was a great help. I also came up with many things that initially had me stumped, like COME HITHER. Personally unknowable arcana the like of LEA MICHELE were mercifully mostly revealed by crosses.\n\nThe SW corner was what caused me most trouble. I didn't know INES and forgot DIANA. Also, I don't think of king or queen as a title, unlike Her or His Majesty, but it may simply be because I'm confusing \"title\" with \"term of adress\". Also, Polish has the word \"tytuł\", the equivalent of your \"title\", but apparently the meaning of the word is slightly different in both languages. To me, \"królowa\" (queen) is just a common noun. Now for a title: \"Jadwiga z Bożej łaski królowa Polski, a także pani i dziedziczka ziem krakowskiej, sandomierskiej, sieradzkiej, łęczyckiej, kujawskiej i pomorskiej\" (\"Jadwiga, by the grace of God, Queen of Poland, as well as Lady and Heiress of the Lands of Kraków, Sandomierz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Kujawy, and Pomerania\").","createDate":"1763718411","updateDate":"1763790938","approveDate":"1763718413","recommendations":25,"replyCount":22,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146792316","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7729230523109436}

I guess if I could offer any critique, it would be that making two of the longest entries in the puzzle celebrity names (no matter how well-known you believe them to be, dear reader) is a choice -- good or bad, your call.

I found them far more engaging that I expected I would.  And it's clear she has a great, undeniable talent for performance.  \n\nI hope I can make some observations that won't be deemed criticism, but simply the musings of an old man who's been out of the game for a long, long time.\n\nAs I kind of implied, I find something profoundly sexy about performing with an instrument--guitar, piano, drums, even a tambourine.  And I really enjoyed those moments.\n\nBut the impact of them was diminished somewhat when she would suddenly stop playing the instrument, but the sound of the song was unchanged.  I know that a lot of this may be pre-recorded, and I don't mind that.  Still, watching Mark Knopfler perform, everything would change were he to drop out of the instrumentation.\n\nI love that the lyrics aren't phoned in, but I have to admit that romantic lyrics just don't register the same with me, now that I've been exiled from that Dangerous Garden for so long.\n\nStill, my heartiest thanks.  I think now I can watch a Kansas City Chiefs game again, knowing that every time Kelsey Travis is in the game, I'm going to be watching Taylor Swift watching him.","createDate":"1763745825","updateDate":"1763765337","approveDate":"1763745826","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146801675,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146803082","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9400319457054138}

It is not just a scale but also includes rules for how notes are used, with performers improvising within these guidelines.

This would be how one finds the length and width, along with the units of measurement used (e.g. metric system, imperial system) but not the values obtained for length and width themselves. So, a measurement is a number with units and a metric is a method for obtaining the number.  But maybe this is too technical.
