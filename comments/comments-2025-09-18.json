Trying this way because sometimes it works:\n\nThe answer is in the first paragraph of the column.  Qualifiers are words or phrases like \"in a way\" or \"in a sense\" that limit meaning.  It's not a crossword-specific term; you might say \"In a way, you're right\" when you mean that the other person isn't completely right, or is right somehow by accident.\n\nIn this crossword, these qualifiers serve as wordplay rather than their normal meaning; \"in a sense\" means that the rest of the clue (\"Meditation chant\", or OM) is literally found wrapped within a sense (TOUCH).\n\nThis is not something that happens with regularity in American-style crosswords, but is common in cryptic (British-style) ones.  The NYT runs cryptic puzzles as the second Sunday puzzle every eight weeks, in rotation with several other types of puzzle.

A reliance on the Wordplay column to explain your gimmick does not a strong crossword puzzle make, I fear. Once “revealed”, the puzzler is left with no discernible theme, direction, or connection upon which they can hope to figure out the rest of the puzzle. Again, how these get by editorial is beyond me, but my experience has shown many are asleep at the wheel with these things.\n\nChose to reveal the puzzle rather than bumble through it. Critics will say it’s a me problem, and hey, maybe so. I don’t feel the best this morning and my brain hasn’t quite woken up for crosswords. But I couldn’t find it in me to try today when faced with such an uninspiring slog of a puzzle, all things considered.","createDate":"1758204748","updateDate":"1758243784","approveDate":"1758204748","recommendations":11,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145090108","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-18","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8268715143203735}

Meaning, I did get that the answer to the first half of the clue was inside the answer.... So I was able to come up with ID, OM, REEVE, etc.   But, I failed to realize that there was a second half;  in other words, I erroneously thought that over was supposed to figure out the middle of the answer and then one would have to come up with a solution by figuring out common words or sayings via the acrosses (for instance, for 58 across I had P-LICA- and I decided the only word that would fit would be Pelican, but I never thought about Li being wrapped inside Pecan, which was the trick of the whole puzzle).    Never figuring out that trick, and never doing any lookups on the Internet made this a slog for me, but that was my own fault for failing to see there were two parts to the trick and not just one.  I also for the longest time felt that my guess of LaCorta for 38D must be correct, which kept me from figuring out SOL- for the 52A.   I finally figured out SELF, and thus it was Lacerta.     Glad other's brains were able to figure out the whole truck and this have a much more enjoyable solve than I did.","createDate":"1758216426","updateDate":"1758242710","approveDate":"1758216427","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145096370","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5968502163887024}

For Thursdays, I needed to learn what the possibilities for the puzzle of a Thursday could be; I remember being _really_ upset on one of my first Thursdays when I looked at the Wordplay column and found out the words were going outside the edges (“how was I supposed to know that could be a thing?!?”), and everyone has their moment of shock when they learn about rebuses :) For other days it was mostly just learning about the wordplay, crosswordese and facts involved, and really internalizing how the wording of the clue corresponds with the desired answer. Chris Remo’s videos where he talks through his thought process as he solves a puzzle were also a big help.\n\nIt’s a big gulf, but it’s not uncrossable.
