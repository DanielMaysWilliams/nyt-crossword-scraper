My wife was living in Carmel Valley SanDiego, adjacent to DELMAR when we started dating, and although she moved east when we got married, she kept her townhouse and rented it for 10 years.  Then in 2021 she repossessed her place and fixed it up. We experimented with bicoastal living until 2024, when she decided the back and forth was too taxing and that she preferred to be back in the east full time.  Although I am a life long easterner, I miss California, and spent many happy hours in DELMAR, walking the beach, or hiking in the Torrey Pines reserve, and even occasionally going to the races at the DELMAR  track.","createDate":"1743130210","updateDate":"1743223657","approveDate":"1743130211","recommendations":31,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140956260","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9253438115119934}

I was moving along last night  at a consistent pace until the NE corner. My brain just got stuck on certain answers and would not let go until I put my phone away and picked it up again this morning. \n\n1) I was sure the second word in 13D was jaCKET. You know, like the insulated \"jackets\" that go around cans and bottles of beer. Probably influenced by 12D.\n\n2) 11A could only be epIc or SAGA or some kind of 4-letter bIo (those capital i's look like lower case L's) I'd never heard of.\n\n3) 16A could only be some variation of flapper. Flap? Is that a thing? \n\n4) 25A I knew had to be SAWS + a proposition. I tried \"at\" and \"on.\" UP didn't occur to me, probably because the word \"sinking\" brings to mind the downward motion of the saw. Yes, I get what SAWS UP means, so no one needs to explain it to me. Not saying it's wrong. I just personally don't love it as clued. \n\n5) 40A I mentally ran through the alphabet for the last letter (having no idea what 14D could be) and never connected ABED with Out until I finally finished the puzzle this morning and had the lightbulb moment.\n\nAll of this said, I put the puzzle to bed last night with only the NE corner unfinished, erased it all and started over this morning to finish pretty easily. I don't know if my brain is processing the answers while I sleep or if it's just seeing the puzzle with fresh eyes, but this often happens when I get stuck.\n\nTook longer than usual, but zero lookups!","createDate":"1743174291","updateDate":"1743219044","approveDate":"1743174293","recommendations":8,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140969927","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-28","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7205249667167664}

It helps to solve with a partner some times because they may figure out how the clue works. It also helps just to have fun. That sometimes means resisting the urge to go back and look at the confusing clues (coming here helps). But it can be fun to come back years later to a puzzle. Personally, my mind has been rewired by crosswords a bit (like always looking for the uncommon definition/usage of a word). Much is now obvious to me that was not so in the past.","createDate":"1743210628","updateDate":"1743248653","approveDate":"1743210630","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140970921,"parentUserDisplayName":"Nancy Sculerati MD","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140986492","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5278044939041138}

In 1980, Panamanian boxer Roberto Durán fought American Sugar Ray Leonard for the welterweight championship of the world.  At some point in this fight, Durán was famously reported to have said \"No más,\" and the fight was stopped in favor of Leonard.  Whether he actually said those words is up for debate, but the supposed words uttered to end the fight became very well known.\n\nIn English, of course, an uncle is the brother of one of your parents, or even the husband of your parent's sister.  This is not how \"No más\" is meant to equate to \"uncle\" in English.  That would indeed make no sense.\n\nBut another use of the word comes from the playground.  When a fight breaks out between two small children, usually boys, the one with the upper hand says to the other, \"Say 'uncle'.\"  If the other does, it means he quits.  \n \nThat's how \"uncle\" comes to mean \"No más,\" and it's perfectly normal in American English.  (The question mark, as you know, is how you know they just don't want the Spanish word for your parent's brother.)","createDate":"1743177344","updateDate":"1743230621","approveDate":"1743177346","recommendations":22,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140958485,"parentUserDisplayName":"Marco","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140972451","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-28","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6455438733100891}

For me it's been somewhat rare-ish since I was diagnosed... but lately it's been increasing quite a bit to a noticeable and quite inconvenient degree. \n\nIt's one of the few things that I can't work through. I'll work through almost anything (\"You've got no arms left...\"   \"It's just a flesh wound!\") but AFib stops me completely, until my heart is back to normal.\n\nIt's an annoyance, but it is also dangerous. It greatly increases one's risk for a stroke. This is managed by going on a blood thinner to try to prevent stroke. \n\nI actually have a consultation next week for what could be the answer to my increasing AFib events, which is an ablation. @Mark in Santa Fe has mentioned out here that he recently had one and had a really good experience so far. I'm really afraid to get it because they have to go up using a catheter and they either burn or freeze parts of your heart causing the irregularities. 😬🤯😬\n\nI'm super scared of it but otherwise it's a lifetime of medications that seem to be increasingly not helping me. It's been nice to hear Mark's experience. I know one other person who's had it, so that helps a bit. \n\nThanks for asking!","createDate":"1743191662","updateDate":"1743248811","approveDate":"1743191663","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140980503,"parentUserDisplayName":"HeathieJ","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140981289","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-28","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5190037488937378}
