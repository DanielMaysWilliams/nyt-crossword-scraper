MIT traditionally sends out its undergrad admission letters on Pi Day. Often, the letters are released at 6:28 PM, known as “Tau Time” (Pi x 2). An exception was made on March 14, 2015 (“Super Pi Day”) as that date reflected the value to five decimal places (3.1415). The letters were sent out at 9:26 AM, the next three digits. \nI’ll see myself out….","createDate":"1710421293","updateDate":"1714655194","approveDate":"1710421294","recommendations":59,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131838552","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8009901642799377}

(I'm now going crazy because, once again, I've forgotten the name of the constructor so I can't track it down. Welcome to the fuzzy world of what's laughingly known as my memory.)  Anyway, I was afraid that this puzzle would steal that brilliant theme idea and do something very similar.  But it didn't.\n\nThis was a lot of very noticeable grid design for what seems to me a very tiny payoff.  PI DAY isn't much in the way of themers and as for the grid-spanners, ALBERT EINSTEIN and STEPHEN HAWKING, while they may be scientists, I don't think that either one had much, if anything, to do with PI.  They certainly didn't discover it and I'm not sure they needed to use it for anything either. \n\nMaybe PLATO did?  More likely EULER?  But they're not grid-spanning answers, so they pale in comparison, puzzle-wise.\n\nYes, today is PI DAY.  And, for all you constructors out there who haven't been able to get a puzzle into the NYT, here's one possible avenue.  Pick a holiday, any holiday, and build a puzzle around it.  If it's any good at all, it will probably up your chances considerably.\n\nPS -- Can someone help me out with identifying that epic Sunday PI rebus?  It's driving me crazy.","createDate":"1710425715","updateDate":"1710477600","approveDate":"1710425718","recommendations":3,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131840867","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5031729340553284}

Apu is a naturalized  U.S. citizen who holds a Ph.D. in computer science. He graduated first in his class of seven million from “Caltech”  (Calcutta Technical Institute) before going on to get his doctorate at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology. In the May 6, 1993 episode”Marge in Chains”, Marge is arrested for shoplifting some liquor from the Kwik-E-Mart. During the trial, Marge’s lawyer questions the reliability of the store’s proprietor (Apu). On the stand, he says he has perfect memory and that the 40,000th digit of pi is “1”.

It's been clued that way nine times in the Shortz Era (cf. \"Utmost\" 21 times, and \"To the __ degree\" 26 times).\n\nIf you Google \"1st, 2nd, nth\", you'll get a bunch of hits where NTH is last in a series of ordinal numbers, literally matching the clue.","createDate":"1710442104","updateDate":"1710509738","approveDate":"1710442106","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131844321,"parentUserDisplayName":"Aitch","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131851821","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7516870498657227}
