The palace was completely destroyed in WW2. The Tomb survived though, and it's still there, with a ruined portion of the arcade over it. Recently work has begun on the reconstruction of the palace - as a pet project of the 2015-2023 autocratic government, it has rightly proved highly controversial and had been challenged in the courts. The thing is, Warsaw was virtually annihilated during the war, and while some of the iconic buildings and streets were reconstructed in the 1940s-1970s, we're OK with the rest being gone forever - we made peace with it and moved on, creating new spaces, looking forward rather than back.

Also, the second meaning of \"moot\" dates back to at least 1830, so if we're dopes, we've been dopes for quite some time.\n\nAnyhoo, both these meanings come from an archaic noun \"moot\", which meant \"meeting, assembly\" (comparable to an archaic use of \"thing,\" to mean much the same; or to \"diet\"--wouldn't it be great if called it the \"Diet of Davos\" [although there was only one worm in attendance.])  Tolkien lovers will recognize this in his coinage of \"Entmoot.\"\n\nBut here's my fun discovery for the day! The OED list another, probably unrelated, dialectical meaning of \"moot,\" for a \"stump of a tree.\" Now, Tolkien really couldn't do humor at all, but he was good at coming up with clever twists on language, and I wouldn't be surprised if he had this second meaning in mind as well when he coined with \"entmoot.\"\n\n***\n\nI really don't \"get\" \"he/they,\" other than they are both (nominative) pronouns.","createDate":"1769519567","updateDate":"1769578226","approveDate":"1769519568","recommendations":29,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148396799","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5881481170654297}

I think the definitions appear contradictory because people tend to read “moot” as qualifying the worthiness of the discussion, when the word simply refers to the multiplicity of viewpoints around a topic (whether or not it is worth discussing them). \n\nThe first definition of moot seems to indicate something is worth discussing (it’s a moot point = it’s debatable) and definition 2 seems to indicate a debate is worthless (it’s a moot point = it makes no difference at this point). \n\nDefinition 1 (the one we Americans are not used to) is the more traditional one; ‘moot’ evolved from words that referred to meetings or assemblies. Again, the whole point is that some matter remains unsettled. For some reason, we chose to give it the connotation that the debate goes on *after the relevance of the topic has passed* (which is not something carried from its etymology), but the core point, the commonality with the first definition, is that multiple viewpoints remain in contention.","createDate":"1769516559","updateDate":"1769545393","approveDate":"1769516560","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148389835,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steven M.","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148395218","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6276473999023438}

I get you, or at least I think I hope I do. And you're right, which comes as no surprise given your intelligence, empathy and insight into all things human: there are two Andrzejs. One is a kinda sensitive, introverted boy who loved his parents, his best friend (whom he lost touch with only to learn he had cancer when it had killed him... The sensitive Andrzej will never forgive himself for it), and his dogs, and has always enjoyed learning about the world and experiencing it. The other is a crude and crass, fast-car-loving, extroverted bodyguard of the first guy. Now, both Andrzejs are the real Andrzej - the first can't exist without the other. It took me 40+ years to understand the synergy but now that I have, I'm embracing it.","createDate":"1769514610","updateDate":"1769595574","approveDate":"1769514613","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148394172,"parentUserDisplayName":"Matt","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148394484","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.643019437789917}
