The depositor gains a small amount of interest, or even if the account is not interest-bearing, at the very least the benefit and security of not needing to keep track of literal stacks of cash.

If you say \"waiter\", it is understood to be a man; a woman is a \"waitress\".  Since there's no such thing as a \"servress\", \"server\" is used without regard to gender, and some think that's important.\n\nI have a female friend who is a (non-famous) thespian, who insists on being called an \"actor\", following a recent trend of using that word gender-neutrally.  She hates being called an \"actress\", as if it were some sort of terrible slander.  Meanwhile, the various award shows call their awards \"Best Actor\" for men and \"Best Actress\" for women.\n\nIf she wants to be an \"actor\", fine with me.  I don't think it (or the nomenclature for restaurant workers) matters that much to most people.\n\nBut here in the US, alongside \"server\", we still commonly say \"waiter\" and \"waitress\", and what they do is \"wait tables\"; \"serving\" is too broad a category here without further context.  After all, they could be playing tennis, sitting on a jury, or fulfilling a military obligation.\n\nAnd some people find \"serving\" a little too...servile.","createDate":"1739450043","updateDate":"1739471485","approveDate":"1739450045","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139753735,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139755626","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7613403797149658}
