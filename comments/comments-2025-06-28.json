I went and looked at Mr. Guzman's puzzle page and noted one of the more remarkable Thursday puzzles I've ever seen.

Anyway.... a Thursday from September 26, 2024.\n\nHard to entirely describe this one, but I'll give it a shot.

Solved it unaided, but took almost an hour. In part because Mario and I reside in different universes, so BOWSER and KOOPATROOPA were unknowns, with the latter being almost a random string of letters.\n\nNot a fan of the grid design here, with the NW and SE barely connected to heart of the grid. Certainly this is helpful to the constructor, since it allows for modular construction. Note the very common letters SAN/SE  and AL/SES at the connection points. \n\nThat said, there were only eight 3-letter entries here, and the six long central entries were solid enough. TOURDEFORCE and DAISYCHAINS nicely flanked the turtle-shelled flunky, and SANTATRACKER was interesting and cleverly clued.
