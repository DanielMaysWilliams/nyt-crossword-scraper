Esoteric references to little known people or books is a sign of weakness either in the clues or in finding a way to put letters in the space.    As much as I have loved Asimov over the decades I never came across ABA.  Why is this acceptable when there are so many clever ways to suggest ABA as an answer? Why use \"accouterment\" as an acceptable spelling for educated readers?  Nor are queens normally noted for sashes accept in beauty pageants (in which case a better word would be \"adornment\").  Why should the editors allow rarefied entries like Bon \"Iver\" when a little effort would come up with a different solution to that area.

There was no indication in the clue that the answer would be an abbreviation, but I've been told dozens of times in these comments, usually by Barry, that some terms, while considered abbreviations initially, became so commonly used over the years they are now words in their own right. I thought IvS fit the bill. BEvIHANA looks no less strange and unfamiliar to me than BANIHANA 🤷.\n\nUltimately, then, I really did need that one lookup, and I would have needed it (or checking the puzzle) even if math was not my nemesis, and I were smart enough to get the ANTS clue.\n\nBTW, apparently there is one BENIHANA in Warsaw.

Everyone was crowing yesterday about the puzzle being too easy for a Thursday, and I had to run the alphabet in several places to finally get it right because of a few names.  Whereas this one, despite not remembering how to spell Pedro's last name and only remembering that the Breaking Bad lead's names were alliterative but not what they WERE, fell right into place.  \n\nDelightful puzzle, whether on a Wednesday or a Friday.","createDate":"1752236033","updateDate":"1752286329","approveDate":"1752236035","recommendations":18,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143458280","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-11","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.4594971835613251}

She's been in seven of Almodovar films, but one of her most delightful performances was in \"Vicky Christina Barcelona,\" a Woody Allen movie. (However you might feel about him, four women have won Oscars in films he directed.)  Cruz was terrific in that one and sooo deserving of her Oscar. \n\n\"Talk to Her\" was an Almodovar movie that blew me away from start to finish, from the opening and closing Pina Bausch dance sequences to all the complicated drama in between.  (Google the trailer)\n\nBausch is another favorite. I first saw her on the PBS Arts Channel, one of those thrilling times when you \"discover\" an international star, and I was lucky enough to see her company perform in Paris and in Berkeley while she was still alive.

If you think the alternate spelling is off, check out the alternate pronunciations. I'm not one to rail against language change, but this is one of those borrowed French words that only sounds right to me with something close to the original pronunciation. It can be risky trying to throw some of these words into conversation if you've mostly only seen them in print. My brother-in-law used this word recently, and his pronunciation made me wonder. I think it was close to one of the M-W versions, but it sounded weird to me. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accoutrement\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accoutrement</a>","createDate":"1752248994","updateDate":"1752248994","approveDate":"1752248994","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143454931,"parentUserDisplayName":"McX","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143466195","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5307396054267883}

You are correct: Greek myth lacks a canonical sea serpent figure akin to, say, Norse mythology (hello, Midgard Serpent). Hydra of Lerna is a singular, chthonic, freshwater monster—deadly but definitively non-marine. Her name (ὕδρα) is etymologically related to “water” (ὕδωρ), but functionally a proper noun. There’s no plural or generic use in Classical Greek—to Euripides, Pindar, et al., Hydra is the Hydra. Even as late as  the 2nd c. CE Bibliotheca, Pseudo-Apollodorus summarizes very matter-of-factly how Heracles dispatches her: monster, marsh, many heads, cauterized stumps. \n\nBut then from Late Antiquity into the Middle Ages there’s a semantic shift. If you look at the Hydra in Aberdeen or Cambridge bestiaries, Christian morality seeps into the text and the Hydra is now more allegorical. Also, the illustrations start placing her in a marine setting. The serpent imagery is absorbed into Christian theology: serpent = Satan; multiple heads = persistent sin; water = baptismal or apocalyptic terrain. Now “hydra” officially breaks free of the Greek marsh and starts moonlighting as a generalized sea monster/symbol of sin. The texts are now less interested in mythic canon and more in moral allegory—fertile ground for semantic creep.\n\nFast forward a few more centuries and today hydra (lower-case h) is indeed a [sea serpent of myth]. \n\n(Just not Greek myth.)","createDate":"1752228000","updateDate":"1752297947","approveDate":"1752228001","recommendations":54,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143455341,"parentUserDisplayName":"John","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143455957","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7662369608879089}
