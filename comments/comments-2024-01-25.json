If we segregate women to their own \"story\" (or special offset box on the textbook page), we end up making them peripheral to the dominant tales we tell about the past. The story of the Nineteenth Amendment is not exclusively a story about women gaining the franchise; after all, at a basic level, it relied on the votes of male legislators to make it happen. It changed the makeup of the electorate as a whole. It reflected an evolution in ideas about citizenship. (It also enfranchised white women *far* more successfully than women of color.)\n\n(It's also true that the wordplay doesn't work grammatically, but that isn't my main concern. Additionally, the amendment as written didn't actually grant the vote to \"women.\" Rather, it excluded \"sex\" as a criterion for limiting the franchise. Though given the historical moment, the effect was to grant the vote to [some] women, it was worded to apply broadly to everyone.)\n\nPaying attention to groups who have been traditionally overlooked in mainstream accounts of the past shouldn't just add other stories we can pay attention to or ignore as we choose; it should transform the stories we already have to make them more accurate because they have become more inclusive and therefore better reflective of their subjects.\n\nSincerely,\nA Historian","createDate":"1706155845","updateDate":"1706335536","approveDate":"1706155848","recommendations":99,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130691003","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5714918971061707}

One of the more challenging (for me) Thursday puzzles in recent memory. Liked the fill and the clever cluing, but the theme seemed a bit off.

We have the definite \"Mercury is in this\" for GLASSTHERMOMETER---but plenty of glass thermometers contain ethanol rather than mercury. Clearly that clue should have been \"Mercury might be in this\" , but then it would duplicate the clue for RETROGRADE. \"The Mercury might be in this\" is fine for the interesting entry WNBAFINALS, but \"Mercury was in this\" seems odd for BOHEMIANRHAPSODY. Do we say that a singer is \"in\" a song? Was John Lennon in Imagine?

Different view here.  For us, using average daily solve time as a measure of difficulty, the editors do an amazing job at calibrating  difficulty day by day through the week.\n\n  I posted our data a few weeks ago here   Based on about 3200 puzzles completed our daily average solve time (as given in the app) increased almost exactly 28% each day, except Thursday.  Even for Saturday to Sunday, where the editors have to calibrate lesser difficulty with increased grid size.  Average solve time increase about the same as for other days. That is stunningly good editing.\n\n Of course any given week there will be variation, but over time, they are nailing it.  \n\nAs for Thursday, I suspect our larger percentage increase in solve time is because the added trickiness makes the difficulty level (and therefore solve time) vary much more for a particular than for other days.  If you just don’t get the trick (it happens) you can run up some unusually long solve times. If you get it easily, it goes quickly. \n\nIn any event, I’m amazed how, over time, the editing for difficulty is so consistent.","createDate":"1706221517","updateDate":"1706249321","approveDate":"1706221519","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":130703161,"parentUserDisplayName":"Walter Burton","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130713550","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-01-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8057882189750671}
