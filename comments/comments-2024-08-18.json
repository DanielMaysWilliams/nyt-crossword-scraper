The totality of our experience seems to determine how hard we perceive a puzzle.  Those of us that are drawn to wanting to solve word puzzles are already a specific group who have an innate ability to understand and enjoy language.  So why are some puzzles more satisfying than others? I don't know about other folks, but for me it's the images and experiences that the words in the puzzle conjure.  It's the wit, humor and joy of the words and how they connect to the very personal mental library that they touch.  Like opening a book. \n\nJust a little Sunday afternoon musings.

Perhaps my comments need some context.\n\nI know you're not a kid just out of school, but I believe you're a few decades younger than me. This was the 70s, and video games were very basic in those days. Pong, Pac-Man and Asteroids. I couldn't--and still can't--fathom why anyone older than \"just allowed to drink\" would be interested in spending hours and countless quarters playing those games.\n\nAs for amusement rides, I was relating my personal feelings. I grew out of them very early. My wife didn't, so I happily accompanied her on them until the kids came along and they got old enough for the big rides. Then, she could go on them with the kids and I could stay behind watching. Eventually, she grew out of them, which surprised me at the time, and now she can't even look at a roller coaster.\n\nA few years ago, I went on a vacation with my grad-school daughter, who wanted to go to Universal for one day. I closed my eyes and went on the rides with her, and she knew it was a sacrifice for me.\n\nI think at a certain age, you realize that amusement park rides can have serious accidents, and that you could be seriously injured or killed. Teenagers don't think that way. They assume everything will be fine and the people in charge know what they're doing. \n\nFor me, that certain age came quite early, I guess.
