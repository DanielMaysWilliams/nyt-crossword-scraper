When we use such a noun as a modifier we always use the singular. You have a toilet brush, but if you have more than one, you don't have some toilets brushes. You have some toilet brushes. A singular noun modifying a plural noun. \n\nBut when the plural is irregular, such as the plural of mouse (mice), most people use the plural as a modifier. \"Mice hunters,\" as in this clue. I would use \"mouse hunters\" instead. \n\nAnother example that some will probably dismiss as sexist is \"girl prodigies.\" You would never say \"Look at those two girls prodigies excelling at their work.\" You would refer to them as \"girl prodigies.\" But if they were older, most people would refer to them as \"women prodigies\" whereas I would say \"woman prodigies.\" \n\nAlong similar lines, \"teeth whitening\" grates my ears almost off (figuratively speaking). It is \"tooth whitening,\" even though more than one tooth is being whitened. \n\nAnd so on and so forth. \n\nI have never heard of a good reason why irregular plurals should retain the plural form when used as modifiers.

Speaking of lawyers, I can tell you that it was a widespread practice among estates lawyers — maybe not so much in the modern era (whenever that may have begun) — to charge a pittance for preparing a will for a client, in the expectation that the executor(s) would retain the drafting lawyer to assist with applying for probate of the will (in common law jurisdictions) and otherwise assisting in the administration of the estate.  The legal fees for the latter would be, comparatively speaking, a lucrative retainer.\n\nIt was all the more probable for the executor(s) to retain the drafting lawyer if the client’s will had been left for safekeeping with the lawyer.  There was, evidently, a thought among executors that the lawyer had some type of proprietary interest in the will that obliged the executor(s) to retain the lawyer for the administration.\n\nFor a number of reasons, lawyers no longer treat the will drafting retainer as a “loss leader” and they are very reluctant to assume the responsibility or cost for retaining a client’s original will.","createDate":"1739709597","updateDate":"1739748464","approveDate":"1739709599","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139837237,"parentUserDisplayName":"Hardroch","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139837430","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-02-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7748488187789917}
