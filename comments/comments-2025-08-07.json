Plowed on, but a still blank squares refused to budge, and in the end, I had to come to the column to get Deb's help.

Thank you :)\n\nThat's what I figured about BAT, but is that word used as a verb there? I think I recall, most likely from Steve L's informative posts (thanks, Steve! You're the best) the phrase \"at bat.\" Bat as a noun I get. As a verb though - not so much. Or am I misunderstanding something?\n\nAfter posting I started wondering about GAMIN. In Polish we have the word \"gamoń,\" which looks like it might be related to yours. It literally means a nitwit, but it may also be used to describe a mildly annoying person. I can imagine somebody calling a GAMIN a gamoń. Let me look up the etymology. Aaaand... Nope, the etymology of our word is Slavic.\n\nOur legal system does not distinguish between different types of accountants. Universities offer finance and accounting courses, of course, but you don't have to finish one to call yourself a księgowa/księgowy (female/male bookkeeper - yes! In Polish an accountant and a bookkeeper are the very same thing). We don't have CPAs as a regulated profession, either. Thus, we have no need for complex terminology related to tax and accounting people. We just call them all bookkeepers. \n\nWhenever a NYT crossword calls a CPA a bookkeeper, and American CPAs are outraged in the comments (rightly so, I believe, given your more complex system), I am reminded how surprised I was when I first experienced that furore. In Polish a CPA, an accountant, a bookkeeper and a tax preparer are all called księgowe/księgowi (f/m plurals).","createDate":"1754549854","updateDate":"1754624928","approveDate":"1754549856","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144095907,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144095996","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5176208019256592}

Spaight\n\nI generally enjoy Thursdays. Currently I'm going through the crossword archives and it's the Thursdays I'm most drawn to. I like rebuses the most, but sometimes I'm really impressed by some of the tricks constructors were able to come up with. If I ever construct a puzzle myself, I'd like it to be a Thursday 😈\n\nFailing on Thursday and Saturday I'm generally fine with - for a foreign solver like me those are the hardest puzzles. On Thursday, the gimmicks usually mean I need more crosses than usual to get the theme. Thus, when the fill is beyond me, my enjoyment suffers. As for Saturdays, they typically feature the most uncommon words and the most arcane proper nouns. Most Saturday puzzles are not doable for me without lookups. Again, having to Google stuff adversely influences my solving experience.\n\nDoes frustration sometimes (well, often 🤣) show in my comments? Sure. I won't pretend I *like* \"failing\" on a puzzle (hence the negative emotions in my posts), yet ultimately I'm ok with it though - I can't expect to solve every American grid. Some names, concepts and words are simply inaccessible to a Polish guy, even one with near-perfect English.\n\nAlso, even if American culture feels very alien to me in some respects, learning about it is one the coolest aspects of solving these crossword. I may balk at the abbreviations, school names, etc. but in the end I'm slowly remembering more of them.\n\n🕊️","createDate":"1754558924","updateDate":"1754624988","approveDate":"1754558925","recommendations":16,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144096368,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144096614","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8133693933486938}

Take all that follows with a pinch of salt though, since I am a lawyer, not a linguist.\n\nYou know how they say native inhabitants of polar regions have 50 terms for snow? Vocabularies of languages are shaped by the environment, society, history and culture of the people who speak them. For example, we may call all accountants bookkeepers, but since our state regulates the economy to a greater extent than yours, we have many more terms for types of business licences. \n\nOur grammars differ, too. For example, we very rarely use \"ja,\" the equivalent of your \"I,\" in a sentence, because who is doing something is expressed via conjugating verbs. Take this simple sentence: \"Jestem w domu\" (I am home). \"Jestem\" is \"to be\" conjugated to indicate the speaker means themself. \"W\" is in/at. \"Dom\" is home, and \"domu\" is dom declensed to the proper case. The whole sentence is built quite differently in the two languages.\n\n@Times Rita\n\nThat malady is spreading to Poland, too.

In Poland strawberries are considered our national fruit, but they are available only from the end of May to the beginning of July. They are sold in kobiałka, a kind of square, wooden basket. Most Polish households have one somewhere, waiting for late spring. You take an empty one to the farmer's market and get another one with 2 kg of strawberries. Thus the delicate fruit is not transfered from container to container, which would overly bruise it.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on kobiałka is in Polish only, but I link it for the picture:\n\n<a href=\"https://pl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobia%C5%82ka_(pojemnik\" target=\"_blank\">https://pl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobia%C5%82ka_(pojemnik</a>)","createDate":"1754544831","updateDate":"1754611212","approveDate":"1754544832","recommendations":14,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144095637,"parentUserDisplayName":"kkseattle","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144095705","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-07","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9564441442489624}

By proper, I actually mean that \"L\" in this context is a proper noun, the way you might characterize The Tube in London, or the Metro in Paris.\n\nBut the proper name The L is derived from the common noun \"elevated,\" which means a train that runs on overhead tracks.\n\nThe L is largely elevated, although parts of it run as a subway, at grade level, or in open cuts.  But unlike other transit systems, most of the downtown lines run aboveground as elevated railways.  And a common abbreviation for ANY elevated rail system is \"the el\" (note lack of capitalization).  New York City still has ELS in the outer boroughs and far northern Manhattan, although they've all been removed from the downtown.  Other major cities still have elevated lines called ELS.\n\nSo, although Chicago has The L, the L consists of elevated trains, which are also ELS.  Putting Chicago in the clue simply hints at a place where elevated trains are more prominent than they are in other cities.\n\nOn this basis, I think the clue and answer are legitimate, although there will always be complaints about them.","createDate":"1754573486","updateDate":"1754599501","approveDate":"1754573487","recommendations":12,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144101141,"parentUserDisplayName":"Ken Burk","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144101931","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8667999505996704}
