Two really terrific, and really different, movies, dontcha know!?\n\nThe Fargo TV series is pretty terrific too!!\n\nWhile I agree with many posters about wishing me themers were more witty instead of anagrams, there were a lot of fun entries in here. Those two movies are my fun favorites, but Buckwheat for RASCAL was also fun!\n\nOf course, TATERTOT hot dish (as they say in Minnesota) or casserole {as those of us from Wisconsin would typically say) was a fun one too!!  My favorite way to eat them is as TOTchos... Basically nachos but tots instead of chips. Maybe with some bacon on top, not VEGAN. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)\n\nCINNAMON BREAD reminded me of an amazing human who most of us just called Ma, who used to make cinnamon toast, just toast with a load of butter mixed with a load of cinnamon until it turns very dark brown. It's the most incredible simple meal in the world. I used to work with her at a camp that is also so very special to my heart, and we would make like 600 slices of these a morning. I never tired of them! Somehow they're never the same when I make it at home, even though I know exactly what I'm doing. One of those things. She's gone now, and even her daughter has just recently passed, but they live on in my, and so many, hearts. \n\nSo, though it was good, it may not be a favorite puzzle, but it sure brought up a bunch of favorite memories. ☺️","createDate":"1756053431","updateDate":"1756121685","approveDate":"1756053432","recommendations":11,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144500532","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9764561653137207}

The first time it came out perfect. The second and third times it collapsed after it came out of the oven. (Still tasted great, though.)\n\nI assume that I did something wrong the first time that turned out to be right. Too bad I don’t know what that was. (Odds are that I measured something incorrectly.)\n\nA friend who moved from Austin to Santa Fe gave us a book on high altitude baking. We’ll get the cake right one ipof these days.","createDate":"1756096216","updateDate":"1756107024","approveDate":"1756096217","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144505102,"parentUserDisplayName":"Leapfinger","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144507685","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-24","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9152632355690002}
