It was a great day for the city when they sent Chief Wahoo back down to the minors, and changed the name of the MLB team to the Guardians. The name was chosen to honor, and logos designed to reflect, the Guardians of Traffic, eight monumental Art Deco sculptures that decorate the pylons at either end of the Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland. Each Guardian protectively cradles a different mode of transportation against his bared bosom: hay wagon, stagecoach, automobile, truck, etc.\n\nDesigned by architect Frank Walker and sculptor Henry Hering, and built in 1932, the Hope Memorial Bridge spans the Cuyahoga River and has its eastern terminus near the (MLB) Guardians' home Progressive Field. Formerly, and more functionally, named the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge, in 1983 the bridge was renamed to honor Harry Hope, father of Comedian Bob a local stone-mason who worked on the bridge; and, presumably, the tribute was meant to extend to all the other construction workers as well. But they didn't have famous sons.\n\nFor those with an eye for bizarre detail, the areolas on the sculptures' chests are designed to resemble little wheels.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Memorial_Bridge#/media/File:Guardian_of_Traffic_(cropped).jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Memorial_Bridge#/media/File:Guardian_of_Traffic_(cropped).jpg</a>\n\n***\n\nIf, like netizen  Magali Fabre, you can handle both frets and reeds (and sing), here's what you can do.

Beside the two Sundays I talked about above, it was one of the answers in an amazing piece of construction: A theme-less Friday from August 25, 2006.\n\nThat one had 9 grid-spanning 15 letter answers, including a triple stack across the middle of the puzzle. The 6 down answers all crossed that triple stack and included two double down stacks on either side of the puzzle. And... with one possible exception they were all quite familiar terms or phrases. \n\nThe across triple stack:\n\nCOLORADOSPRINGS\nATANDTOPERATOR\nROSIETHERIVETER\n\nAnd the two adjacent down stacks: \n\nGETHELASTLAUGH\nSANANTONIOTEXAS\n\nSATELLITEDISHES\nONCEISNOTENOUGH\n\nAnd... as noted on Xword Info, the grid had both left-right and up-down symmetry. \n\nHere's the Xword Info link: \n\n<a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=8/25/2006&g=5&d=D\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=8/25/2006&g=5&d=D</a>\n\nI'm done. \n\n..","createDate":"1707825916","updateDate":"1707855106","approveDate":"1707825918","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131129104,"parentUserDisplayName":"Rich in Atlanta","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131129332","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8092585206031799}

It was only later that the term started being used to describe a dunk and took over that term.\n\nAs for the supercharger thing, as others have noted the original means of charging the cylinders with more air than the ambient atmosphere allowed was a mechanical item that was powered by the crankshaft.  Later, turbochargers were developed and used the engine exhaust to do exactly the same thing without putting a load on the engine.  The old standard of the mechanical became the norm for supercharger though the turbo is also one, simply powered in a different way.","createDate":"1707842701","updateDate":"1707879175","approveDate":"1707842703","recommendations":6,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131138032","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.749505877494812}
