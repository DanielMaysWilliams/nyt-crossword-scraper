(Note, he can only leave the base after the catch is made.)  A deep fly ball often accomplishes this, and is an out for the batter.  But unless it's the third out, and the inning is over, the runner at third can attempt to score.  \n\nThere are times when this one run is the margin of victory, so the action of the batter, even though he is out, is not viewed as a negative.  He has said to have hit a sacrifice fly, and it does not count against his batting average.\n\nAlthough it's a little stretchy to say that when you SWAT a fly, you're sacrificing it, but we also use SWAT in reference to hitting a baseball far, so now you can see the wordplay there.","createDate":"1736341750","updateDate":"1736364369","approveDate":"1736341754","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138831255,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138834444","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8622353076934814}

We have all led different lives, learning different things along the way. What is a gimme for most may justifiably be an arcane mystery for some.\n\nSome of the puzzles I have struggled with the most were ones most others found easy, or at least enjoyable.\n\nThere was a well-liked Evel Knievel-themed Thursday puzzle in 2023 that I can still remember cursing at time after time, encountering one trivia-based clue after another. It was a an impossibly hard grid for me, a veritable nightmare, and the best puzzle ever for others. And neither evaluation was wrong.
