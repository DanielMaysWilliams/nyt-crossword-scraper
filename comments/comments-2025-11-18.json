However, this grammatical prescription denies a well-established sense of the word: \"to compose or constitute\" (as in \"the nine players who comprise the team\"). Until relatively recently, this sense appeared mostly in scientific writing, but current evidence shows that it is now somewhat more common in general use than the word's other meanings. You might be most familiar with this disputed use in the passive construction, \"to be comprised of\" (as in \"a team comprised of nine players\"). Apologies to the haters: a single sense simply can’t comprise comprise.\n\nLest you say M-W doesn't count, here's what Collins says:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/be-confined\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/be-confined</a>\n\nThis is a usage in mid-change, actually closer to acceptance than not.

What this tells me mostly is that you don't read a lot of poetry.  (If you haven't seen NEONATE out there in real life, you haven't been around too many just-born infants.)\n\nLook at it from the point of view of a constructor.  First of all, it's made up completely of the Wheel of Fortune letters:  E, T, R, and N.  That makes it extremely useful.\n\nSecondly, there's no constructor who uses this word excessively.  According to xwordinfo.com, it's the first time Joe Deeney has ever used it.  The time before that, on 12/8/24, it was the first time John Kugelman used it.  And so on back until 2013.\n\nCrossword greats like Barry C. Silk, Brendan Emmett Quigley, Fred Piscop, Matt Gaffney, Patrick Berry, Paula Gamache, and others, have all used it.  Once each.  Probably less frequently than Keats, Shakespeare and Browning did.\n\nIn fact, in all of the Modern Era, you'll only find two constructors who have used ETERNE twice:  Matt Ginsberg (once in a co-construction) and Richard Silvestri (and that was last millennium).  \n\nSo I'd bet that constructors are limiting their use of crosswordese.  It's just that there have been a lot of puzzles out there.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?w=ETERNE\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?w=ETERNE</a>","createDate":"1763476539","updateDate":"1763486734","approveDate":"1763476540","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146724279,"parentUserDisplayName":"The X-Phile","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146725159","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-18","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7338531613349915}
