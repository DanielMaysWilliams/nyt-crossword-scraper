(So named because the word in Spanish is TAMAL, but we call it a TAMALE in English.)\n\nWhile it is true that CHAI simply means “tea” in Hindi, it does not in English. And of course, this is an English crossword. \n\nIn English, CHAI tea is not redundant and refers to a specific kind of spiced tea.  Your knowledge of Hindi runs interference here and you react with dismay to the fact that English has borrowed your word and mangled its meaning. However, we already have a perfectly good word for tea—“tea”—so we have created a new use for the Hindi word. \n\nThat how language evolves. KETCHUP doesn’t mean a fish sauce in English. Italian MACCHERONI is simplified to “macaroni”.

It is not, however, a variety of Indian tea, unlike Assam - as you have realized by your second post :)\n\nI learned the American usage from NYT puzzles, and I am glad I did. I have never seen it mistakenly clued as an Indian tea variety before, though.\n\nIn Polish tea is not called czaj (as we would render it, if it were a Polish word) but... Herbata. The \"-ta\" ending is the link between chai/tea and the Polish word. Historically, for a long time tea was not considered an everyday drink in Poland but a medicinal infusion, like many herbs. Latin was prevalent in medicine, and thus tea was called \"herba thea\" - the tea herb. Then things changed, and tea became one of our favorite drinks, but it is still known by a Polonized version of its original Latin designation.\n\nPolish consumer law is quite strict, and it prevents businesses from engaging in misleading practices. Drinks which are not made solely or predominantly of tea leaves may not be marketed as herbata. Thus, fruit or herbal drinks are not called \"herbata,\" but rather \"herbatka,\" which literally is a diminutive of herbata, but in this case it just indicates the thing is not actually tea.","createDate":"1710338888","updateDate":"1710728347","approveDate":"1710338890","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":131814509,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131815692","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-03-13","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6710860729217529}

Thus I realize I have absolutely NO idea whatsoever why some things I say that I think are as ordinary as can be get recommended so fast, and other things I say, some of which I think are so clever, get two or three reccos, or even sometimes none at all.  The day I announced I passed a streak milestone, I expected a lot of reccos, but yesterday's came out of the blue.\n\nThe other thing I noticed in the Tuesday comments is that so many people had a hard time because they didn't recognize the sharp and flat symbols.  In fact, a few of them thought that had to be able to read music to know them.  I don't read music, and I recognized them.  What's going on in the schools these days?
