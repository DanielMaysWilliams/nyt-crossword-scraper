Here's mine.\n\nWhen all the neighborhood kids of the female persuasion were playing with Barbies, my mother finally broke down because she was concerned that not having them was affecting our socialization. So she decided to get us some, but she did it her way. \n\nFirst, she did not believe in gendered toys. (This was in 1964.) If one of us got a doll, we all would. Finally, she compromised and got a Barbie for my little sister, a Midge for me, a Ken for one brother and an Allen for my other brother. Then she told us that this was _all_ she was buying, what they came in. Any accessories, we'd have to make for ourselves.\n\nThis lasted until my father's mother jumped in. An accomplished seamstress who made all our clothes (including our winter coats and most of our underwear), she fashioned all kinds of jewel-like clothes from scraps from her regular sewing, including tiny bras and bathing suits. \n\nI really wanted a Dreamhouse, though. Until one of my friends got one. I took one look at it and thought, \"Meh.\" No where near elegant enough for those wonderful clothes. \n\nAs much as my mother tried not to treat us differently according to gender, her efforts with the dolls failed. My sister and I ended up with our brothers' dolls. We still have them.","createDate":"1750536532","updateDate":"1750595249","approveDate":"1750536533","recommendations":19,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143008547","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-21","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6689499616622925}

It used to be a common question, but not an accusatory one.  But in modern parlance it's just impossible to let it go.  Today.\n\nBut then, yes, I do think it was more fun than threat.  \n\nI love how Loesser didn't stint with the lyrics.
