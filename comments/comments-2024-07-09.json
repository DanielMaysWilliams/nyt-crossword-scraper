A bit is part of the apparatus that goes in the horse‚Äôs mouth and connects to the bridle and reins so the horse can be controlled and directed by the jockey on its back. The bit fits into a toothless ridge of the horse‚Äôs mouth, so the horse never really bites the bit. But it can grind his teeth or jaw against the bit, and if it does, it means that the horse is either nervous, or really excited about racing. That‚Äôs how the phrase ‚Äúchamping at the bit‚Äù entered everyday communications: to indicate extreme eagerness.\nIt's also wrong to say ‚Äúchomping,‚Äù because ‚Äúchomping‚Äù is a transitive verb, or a verb that needs an object for it to make sense. In other words, you have to have something to chomp on if you want to use ‚Äúchomp.‚Äù A horse doesn‚Äôt chomp, or bite, the bit‚Äîhe champs, or grinds, his teeth. No bit is necessary for a champing to happen, so champing is an intransitive verb, which means no ‚Äúobject‚Äù is required.","createDate":"1720519318","updateDate":"1720536987","approveDate":"1720519322","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134516960,"parentUserDisplayName":"Strudel Dad","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134518261","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-09","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5632098913192749}
