I just gave it a Goog and see that the fine people of the internet are somewhat split on whether it's casting shade or not. I'll just be sure to include a nose \"Boop!\" whenever I say it and hope for the best! I love that journey for me!\n\nAs for HECTOR, that is surely a first for me. I do not think I've ever heard or read it but then again I've heard and read many things, so it is possible it just didn't stick. That R was my last fill. I wasn't sure about the baseball positions but a right-fielder made sense and it seemed the best ending for HECTO.  Good to learn new things! \n\nAlso, HECTOR brought this to mind, which I never mind thinking of ATALL: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVq4_HhBK8Y\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVq4_HhBK8Y</a>\n\nOh, 63D - ANN - I knew this right away because she wrote one of my least favorite books and it made me wary of her name when looking at book options. Tons of people love it though, so who am I to say? \n\nIn general, I thought this was a delightful puzzle! One grin after another at the misdirects and clever cluing! Top notch... with only one nit to pick: 53D's clue for ABLED. Others in the comments have addressed it better than I would but it is problematic and should be reconsidered for future puzzles. \n\nOther than that, truly a delight!

I liked this puzzle. As so many others have expressed, I loved loved the STONEHENGE clue, a big grin, & other clues too. Good Friday puzzle. At first it seemed it might be a little easy/breezy, but it had some bite as it turned out.\n\nI had ROYALflush for the longest time in the SE, but it was messing up the crosses so I finally got ROYALCOURT.\n\nAt 65A I filled in \"lyft\" on auto-pilot till I zoomed in on that hyphen and thought, nope. I liked that one. MEGA-sly.\n\nI didn't get HECTOR right away but after a few cross letters the word came back to me.\n\nI think I too would've delighted in the constructor's original T-Rex clue. For a time I was rehearsing with a T-Rex cover band, they were huge Mark Bolan stans/fans, I liked T-Rex but only knew the more famous songs. I have cassette tapes somewhere of our rehearsals... IIRC it was just for one special gig that we did, don't remember the details. Nice guys though, and good musicians; all had day-jobs. They had some clever T-Rex-related name for the band but I don't recall what. The rehearsals were good and fun. I might have to dig up those cassette tapes now!\n\nD'you like funky alt noise experimental industrial rock? This link to The Golden PALOMINOs isn't glam, and it might not be everyone's cup of tea but I really find this song from that interesting \"No Wave\"/ Alt Rock band from awhile back enthralling. \"Clean Plate\"!

The laces close the side quarters, which leads to a clean, narrow-looking instep.  \n\nDerbys have open lacing, in which the side quarters are sewn on top of the vamp, and the vamp goes under the laces (and the side quarters) leading to a wide looking instep. \n\nTo me, two completely different looks (and fits - oxfords are tougher to fit), both instantly recognizable.

Maybe a flicker of recognition from some distant book. \n\nAccording to Chat GPT:\n\nThe verb “hector,” meaning to bully or harass, has been utilized by several notable authors in their works. For instance:\n\t•\tJonathan Swift employed the term in his satirical writings.\n\t•\tHenry Fielding used “hector” in his novel The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling.\n\t•\tLaurence Sterne included the word in The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.\n\nThese examples illustrate the term’s presence in English literature, particularly during the 18th century.\n\nThe verb “hector” originated in the mid-17th century, deriving from the name Hector, a Trojan prince in Greek mythology. The term came to describe blustering or bullying behavior, possibly influenced by a gang of youths in London known as “Hectors” who were notorious for such conduct. ￼\n\nIn literature, “hector” has been used to depict characters exhibiting domineering or bullying behavior. Its usage by authors like Swift, Fielding, and Sterne reflects its integration into the English lexicon during their time, enhancing character development and thematic expression in their narratives.","createDate":"1735316933","updateDate":"1735335905","approveDate":"1735316937","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138570201,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138577427","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8774327635765076}
