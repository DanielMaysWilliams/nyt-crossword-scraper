I needed another thread in today's comments to understand what was going on there. I would never have got that, myself.\n\nBeing Polish, I found OWNER a very weird word relating to NFL. I don't think of sport teams in terms of them having owners. Over here traditionally sports clubs were associations, and many still are, even if they've acquired sponsors over the years. They don't have owners.\n\nI was also confused by having sItU rather than LIEU as \"place\" (after the DIEs/DIEM controversy recently I thought sItU was a good enough solve for its clue) - it meshed with two other answers there, but completely ruined another two.\n\nSo yeah, no gold star for me today, but since I don't care about streaks, that's fine.","createDate":"1743744523","updateDate":"1743830408","approveDate":"1743744524","recommendations":31,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141153590","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-04","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6300538182258606}

As he was a pedestrian, it never occurred to him that the siren was for him, so he continued walking. The police car soon pulled up next to him, and caught his attention. The window rolled down. Yes, with the snow blowing into it. Cop gave him a lecture, as the snow poured down, no other cars passed by, and wind was buffeting my husband so hard he could barely stand still. \n\nSince Milwaukee was such a friendly city, my husband hoped the cop would take pity on him and drive him the next four blocks to his apartment.

Only complaint is it was over too soon.\n\nRegarding the number of NFL team owners, strictly speaking, shareholders own the company, not its assets. If you prepare your personal financial statements, on the balance sheet you would list your company shares as an asset, not the team or the company's cash, buildings or other holdings. I'm not an expert on team ownership but in my experience, most families set up a limited liability corporation (or other legal structure) to hold its businesses. My hunch is that most NFL team owners have established some type of legal entity to shield their personal assets from liability due to bankruptcy or personal injury.\n\nGranted, if you ask who owned the Bucs, most people will say the Glazer family.","createDate":"1743778729","updateDate":"1743808795","approveDate":"1743778730","recommendations":5,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141165035","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5667715072631836}

(Although this is a very, very short story, it might take a couple of replies to fit it all in.)\n\nGods of two species protect the city of Leandra. Both are too tiny to be seen and too numerous to be counted. One species stands at the doors of the houses, inside, next to the coatrack and the umbrella stand; in moves, they follow the families and install themselves in the new home at the consignment of the keys. The others stay in the kitchen, hiding by preference under pots or in the chimney flue or broom closet: they belong to the house, and when the family that has lived there goes away, they remain with the new tenants; perhaps they were already there before the house existed, among the weeds of the vacant lot, concealed in a rusty can; if the house is torn down and a huge block of fifty families is built in its place, they will be found, multiplied, in the kitchens of that many apartments. To distinguish the two species we will call the first one Penates and the other Lares.","createDate":"1743794508","updateDate":"1743839306","approveDate":"1743794509","recommendations":11,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141174271","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8393844366073608}

I only saw it today, so wasn't sure if you'd check back there or not. I really appreciate your kind words and professional advice! \n\nYou prompted me to look up the info you mentioned, which built my confidence in the team I'm working with. It's not the Mayo but the hospital I'm working with has been awarded the best for cardiac care in the Twin Cities. Their team of electrophysiologists seems pretty robust: two PA-Cs, one CNP, and three MDs.  I spoke with the CNP specializing in electrophysiology yesterday and next, after a couple of tests, I'll meet with the doctor who'll do the procedure. There are three at this location and the PA (after my sharing about my anxiety) recommended one in particular, because they have the most experience and she thought I'd be most comfortable with them, which I appreciated. I didn't think to ask how many they do a year but I will next time. \n\nAnyhow, a lot of off-topic info but I wanted to respond to you and let you know that you were very helpful and it made a difference. I appreciate it as I work to keep my anxiety low about this. Facts are always a good thing! ☺️\n\nAnd now, to put this back on-topic. What a great puzzle today! What did you think of the puzzle?

The Penates believe they are the city's soul, even if they arrived last year; and they believe they take Leandra with them when they emigrate.
