My first time encountering one, I didn't know it was a possibility or how to do it, so I do get that, but I still think it's a very approachable one because you can see where the rebuses are and the clues were all very accessible. \n\nWhile I'm not a fan of a STUFFED CRUST on my pizza, I am a big fan of garlic butter around the edges of the crust!

I grasped that it was a rebus more quickly than usual.\n2. I've never done a puzzle with so many rebuses.\n3. For the first time, I completed the puzzle, and NYT does not think the puzzle is finished.\nThe puzzle itself went as quickly as a Thursday ever does. However, NYT does not agree that it's correct. For the first time ever, I pulled up the answers and have compared them to the puzzle multiple times. \nI've taken off my crossword hat and donned my software developer persona. My theory is that a rebus is corrupted somewhere in a way that is not visible to a human. I deleted and reentered all the crusty rebuses -- no go. I originally had some rebuses inside the grid, but I don't remember where. I've now spent more time diagnosing than I did solving.\nI guess I'll have to clear the grid and start over.

If I have an idea of an answer, I go to the crossings immediately. If none of them check out, I leave it all blank and move on. Very often a first pass through a tricky puzzle will have incomplete words scattered here and there and not much more.\n\nThis puzzle, I got all the way down to Tori Amos, having read all the across and down clues in the top half, before I filled in any letters. Thought of all the people who complain about proper names in the puzzles as I gratefully plunked in TORI. But that was the starting point for me. It became clear that my blanks were all due to the needed answer being one space short: a 2-letter rebus in the gray squares was the obvious solution. Result? finished well under my Thursday average time, rewarded by the graphics.\n\nBest pizza I ever had was in St-Paul-de-Vence, a pizzeria called Aux Quatre Coins.

That’s enough to make doing the crossword about as fun as filling out tax forms in triplicate.","createDate":"1719467058","updateDate":"1719483606","approveDate":"1719467060","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134176202,"parentUserDisplayName":"Patrick","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134176332","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.4881010353565216}

When working with multiple rebuses, if you want your puzzle to look “perfect” at the end with all the correct entries and no single letter “correct” answers, you need to leave one known non-rebus answer blank until the end. That way the music won’t suddenly appear when you are not ready. A variation of this occurs when you are solving with Autocheck. As I’m sure you’ve noticed, in that setting if you have a rebus square filled with a single letter, it will be in blue and you can’t simply erase it. The trick is to go to that square, hit rebus, and enter an incorrect second letter, then (in iOS) hit rebus again, and the entry will now be in black with a line through it, and it can be erased. If you don’t use David’s technique and get the music, you’re done and have to clear the puzzle and start over.","createDate":"1719480630","updateDate":"1719528885","approveDate":"1719480632","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":134176846,"parentUserDisplayName":"Dave","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134177388","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8234087824821472}

Don't know who's more half-baked, the puzzle, the constructors, or me.\n\nIt turned out to be a fun puzzle, but I had my moments when (wrong) words kept me from getting anywhere. Once those were corrected I got faster and enjoyed it more. Maybe I should have started this before midnight…\n\nThanks Paolo and Sarah, this one had my favorite toppings.","createDate":"1719468715","updateDate":"1719528798","approveDate":"1719468716","recommendations":11,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134176502","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.3600060045719147}

I jammed through it close to my personal best. \n\nI enjoy the constructor's notes because they give an insight into the mind(s) that created the puzzle. This one was interesting because the challenge, apparently, was less to fill the grid, than to find a way to trick a grid-filling program into doing something unusual. Purists may have a problem with this but as long as it's a tasty puzzle, I care how it got made.","createDate":"1719455019","updateDate":"1719602305","approveDate":"1719455020","recommendations":24,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134174372","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9393879175186157}

All rebus all the time -- and very tricky.\n\nThe hardest thing for me was to see what I was writing/had written in the tiny gray squares.  So tiny.  So gray.  Worse, my two letters blocked out what I could see of the numbers in the grid -- already challenging for me in a normal puzzle.  But I soldiered on.\n\nThought I'd have to Google CARELL; SUAREZ and LILAC -- and was thoroughly prepared to do so.  But I managed to finish without Googling anything.\n\nIs it ridiculous to have that LILAC clue based on a \"setting\" in a kid's book from almost a century ago?  Yes, it's ridiculous.  Evidently I devoured all of the Nancy Drew canon by the time I was 6 or 7 (I was an early reader) and yet today I wouldn't know LILAC if I fell over it. But \"biting\" had to be ACERB (and if not ACERB then ACRID.)  Either way, the ending -AC at 9A in a \"flowery\" clue gave me LILAC.\n\nA wonderfully challenging and stimulating puzzle that really engrossed me and that I enjoyed to the hilt.","createDate":"1719493925","updateDate":"1719531208","approveDate":"1719493928","recommendations":20,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134180225","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-06-27","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6452516317367554}
