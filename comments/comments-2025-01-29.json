I call it the “Oh, hello!” moment.\n\nMaybe you'll relate.\n\nIt happens when I'm stumped by a clue.  The answer spot might even have some letters from crosses, but I just can’t figure out what that answer is.  So, I go elsewhere in the grid, but very soon after, I return to that spot, and I easily see the answer. It doesn’t even come with an aha.  It’s as natural as day.  \"Oh, hello!\"\n\nHow does that happen?  There I am, totally perplexed, and then there I am, not even a minute later, and it’s completely obvious.\n\nThat occurred a number of times in my solve today.  There wasn’t a whole lot of splat fill; it was more a steady march aided by my brain working behind the scenes.  Very, very satisfying fill-in today.\n\nThis is a well-crafted grid, with a profusion of theme squares, but hardly a whiff of junk.  It felt lively to me, no DEAD AIR.  The cluing was so skillfully done, IMO, making me think, but eventually gettable – the perfect recipe for those oh-hellos.\n\nSophia, you’ve got the knack and the talent, and I ADORE your puzzles.

Hard pass on the mimosas though. Too sweet!\n\nAnyhow,  27A, as a Minnesotan, had me perplexed and thinking of, in addition to our 11,842 lakes, of all the amazing things to come out of MN.  For example:\n\n-Honeycrisp apples\n-Pop-up toasters (no BRUNCH TOAS without that!) \n-Seat belts - the retractable ones like we use now\n-Frozen pizza\n-Refrigerated trucks \n-Scotch tape\n-Nerf balls\n-Pontoon boats (nothin' like a good summer day on the pontoon!)\n-Water skis\n-The game Twister\n-Zubaz pants, which will help you not be bottomless at brunch but I still don't recommend them....\n\nAnd, of course, Prince and Bob Dylan! \n\nAhh, what a state, what a mighty fine state. I might even PROPOSEATOAS to it. \n\nAlas, the answer was a little less glorious but it sure did trip me up, which I seem to enjoy. Well, you can't really puzzle unless somethings puzzling. \n\nAnyhow, cute theme once I realized it wasn't just dropping a letter but that they were all BRUNCH items.

Dushanbe in Tajikistan became a Sister City to Boulder in 1987.  The teahouse was presented as a gift to the city from the people of Dushanbe in 1990. Over 40 artisans worked for three years to hand carve the ornate brightly painted wooden panels that make up the teahouse. Everything was done completely by hand, with no power tools at all. The teahouse was constructed in Dushanbe, then meticulously disassembled, each section labeled and crated up for its transport to Boulder. \n\nIt was quite a surprise to the city when they were presented with such an opulent gift. Boulder being Boulder, everyone and their dog had an opinion on how (or whether) it should be used, where it should be located, etc. So it sat in storage in 200 boxes at a sewage treatment plant for the next seven years while the City debated what to do with it.  \n\nThis was not Boulder’s finest hour, to be honest. But thanks to the unfailing efforts of Mary Axe and others, the teahouse was finally erected with artisans brought here from Tajikistan, and it opened to the public in 1998.  All of the acrimony surrounding the debate over its acceptance melted away when everyone could finally experience its beautiful artistry for themselves.  \n\nThe whole unvarnished (hah!) story can be seen here:\n\n<a href=\"https://westword.com/restaurants/the-dushanbe-teahouses-long-strange-trip-5117333\" target=\"_blank\">https://westword.com/restaurants/the-dushanbe-teahouses-long-strange-trip-5117333</a>","createDate":"1738167756","updateDate":"1738183020","approveDate":"1738167756","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":139346015,"parentUserDisplayName":"NYC Traveler","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"139349357","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-29","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7674623727798462}

I love Williams' work, and knew the first scores well (Empire Strikes Back being my favorite) but have never listened to the more recent ones outside of watching the films in the theatre. This video opens and closes with short clips of her in the film, but the bulk of it follows the sheet music with occasional analysis.

As I see it there are two reasons for ambiguous clue-answer pairs like this. First, if LAA is needed to make the crossword work then the clue is probably going to have to be something about the LA Angels. If they went specific and clued it with, “Abbreviation for the name of the baseball team whose home field is in Anaheim, California” it would be a little too much of a giveaway. Second, there’s no crossword rule that says clues have to be so precise as to only have one possible answer.

Don't be discouraged though, you're still making great progress, and each puzzle has it's unique level of toughness and things that may or may not be in our wheelhouses. \n\nOut of curiosity, how do you solve?  If on the phone app, I find that using the list view can really help pinpoint errors.

I appreciate that. Maybe the 3 stars was your way of saying \"It's me, hi, I'm the problem\" (#taylorswift!) in which case I appreciate that as well.
