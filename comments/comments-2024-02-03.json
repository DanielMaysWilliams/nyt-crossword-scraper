Lately, there have been quite a few people counting and criticizing the number of proper names in the puzzle.  Crosswords always have had proper names in them, and the ratio of proper names to other entries has never been lower.   In fact, in the olden days, many of those proper names were obscure rivers and other geographic features, names of species of plants and animals, etc.  Modern crosswords rely on more current proper names, and perhaps that's some people's problem.  They don't know them, and they'd rather have the obscure rivers, which they don't think of as proper names, since what they really mean is pop culture names. (See clue 1A, Day 1.  Then see 113A, 84D, 137D and 141D.) <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=2/15/1942\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=2/15/1942</a> ). \n\nI guarantee you, most people wouldn't.\n\n2. Someone wisely said yesterday that \"What I know < what I don't know\".  However:\n\nYou can get to the point where what you know that will help you solve a crossword will be more than the number of answers you flat-out don't know until you get a slew of crosses.\n\nFor example, I flat-out didn't know SUNK COST FALLACY yesterday (although it seemed many others did).  But I did know enough cross answers that it all fell into place.  The puzzle favors the knowledgeable, but even the less knowledgeable can get there with enough practice.  But if you didn't know DOC MARTENS, TUCSON, TOTO and a few others because of your aversion to proper nouns, you won't get there.","createDate":"1706932393","updateDate":"1707081057","approveDate":"1706932395","recommendations":17,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130907689","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.67383873462677}

Not to mention the (Royal Antediluvian Order of) Buffaloes, over where they work cryptics whilst listening to their BBC programmes.\n\nHi Caitlin! I connect the term \"Hail Mary pass\" with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (whose players were more likely to go on to join the K of C), and apparently it does stem from the 1930's. although, per Wikipedia, the first published use is in reference to a game between the OSU Buckeyes and the (Jesuit) Georgetown Hoyas.  Still, that's a lot of Latin to mutter under your breath, in not very much time.\n\nSophia before Gnosis--but just knowing things doesn't make one wise.\n\nLiving in Detroit with a Partner who's a car nut, no deke on 46D--other than trying Sonata (Accent would work as well) before realizing the answer was both *make and* [model].\n\nNormally, puzzles will bring to mind music, Popular or Classical. Today's evoked an image: an Old Friend from the Cleveland Museum of Art, whom I visit every time I return. \n<a href=\"https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1943.60\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1943.60</a>","createDate":"1706970232","updateDate":"1707056292","approveDate":"1706970235","recommendations":16,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"130911210","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-03","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7925456762313843}
