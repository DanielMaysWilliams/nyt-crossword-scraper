But a nice amount of trivia made it a fun solve.\n\nI got SNELLEN with just two letters; I know that's an answer that was always somewhere in my brain (along with the Brannock Device), and besides, I had to look at one at the beginning of the week for my deteriorating vision. Loved the way SANTAMONICAPIER played out after just a few letters, as well as ROLLERCOASTER. I did goto the pier once on a short trip to L.A., but just to have dinner in the mall across the street, so not actually a visit to the pier. \n\nAll in all, a delightful puzzle that was just hard enough to make it a good solve, with some very nice, fresh answers.","createDate":"1769866684","updateDate":"1769893165","approveDate":"1769866685","recommendations":15,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148524261","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-31","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.49403443932533264}

She helps him do so--that whole bit about the labyrinth and the spool of thread and all--and, afterwards, now being obviously persona non grata at Cnossos, fled with Theseus back to the mainland. \n\nOn the way, they stop for a little R&R on the isle of Naxos, to picnic on the beach, eat a little vanilla ice cream, and ride the pier-side roller coaster there. All that excitement, and the crash from the sugar-buzz, makes Ariadne sleepy, and, waking from her nap, she discovers that Theseus has left without her. Was he as cad, or merely forgetful? Opinions vary. In any case, he later marries her sister, Phaedra.\n\nAriadne is justifiably distraught, and even considers suicide. Lucky for her, she receives some solace from one of the amusement park carnies, who offers her some refreshment stronger than sweet cider, and turns out to be none other than Dionysus, God of Wine, in disguise. So I guess not poor Ariadne after all . . .\n\n\n*As I mentioned a couple days ago, Asterion, aka the Minotaur, has always seemed to me a tragic figure in the whole affair.
