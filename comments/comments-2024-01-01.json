The toddler said \"bye bye plane\" over and over, even as the plane was taxiing to the runway. A flight attendant came over and demanded that the mother make her child stop saying \"bye bye plane\" and the conversation grew heated. The woman and her toddler were eventually kicked off the plane. Bye bye plane! Bye bye plane...\n\nMy sister read me the story back then and once in a while just for the heck of it, one of us might break out into a bye bye plane rhapsody: it was a surefire way of annoying everyone except Those in the Know.

I call that a good start to the new year!! HUZZAH!! (Sorry for the all caps, it's not a puzzle answer but it sort of requires caps. Hey, has it ever been a puzzle answer?)\n\nMy favorite was the crossing of HULA and HULU, especially because I accidentally put HULu for the dance clue and didn't realize it until I got to a Netflix competitor clue. Guess I think about Hulu more than I do about hula. Speaking of, I also enjoyed seeing Meryl Streep. She, as always, was absolutely fantastic in Only Murders in the Building season 3, a fabulous Hulu show.\n\nMy least favorite was BOARDWALK only because it brings back such a terrible memories of the near loss of lifelong friendships. That game is the ultimate test of a relationship's strength! The only thing worse was only time my husband and I played checkers. He's s a good, honest, and exceedingly lovely human but we play by entirely different rules when it comes to checkers. My rule is that you follow the rules and don't cheat. His rule seems to be that anything goes. We'd only been married a few years at that point and, honestly, it's a wonder we've made it here to nearly 19 married years after that night. I credit getting rid of the game immediately. Like do not pass go, do not collect $200, go directly to the dumpster--and bring some matches!\n\nThank you to all the NYT people involved in these puzzles and this great community!

I read all of the helpful columns about how to play the NYT crossword, and always read Wordplay, even the times when I've solved the puzzle first. I understood rebuses right away, though it took me awhile at times to figure out how the particular ones worked. Besides the dailies, I've worked the archives, too. So far, I've completed 1,042 crosswords with a 99.4% solve rate.\n\nAlthough the timer runs, that hasn't been my personal measure of success. That would be how often I have to look something up. The fewer times I have to consult iMDB, Google, or Wordplay, I know I'm getting better. \n\nThe hardest thing for a long time was themes. I had the hardest time grasping just what a theme was, and how they worked. I would complete a puzzle and still not know the theme. I'm getting a lot better at identifying themes, often early in the puzzle. And I've found that sometimes I have all of the theme entries done, and the blank spaces in the grid are simple, short words.\n\nAll of this is to say \"Thank you\" to all of you for your Wordplay columns, and to the Games crew, especially Deb Amlen, for the wonderful, helpful columns on how to negotiate the Times Crossword.

I couldn't come up with one.\n\nThat's because someone moved the goal posts and the third themer is not a ?CK-?CK answer.
