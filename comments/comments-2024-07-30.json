A 72-word grid on a Tuesday, which usually has 76 or 78.  A terrific end-of-the-week clue for SING BACKUP – [Use non-lead pipes?].  A double-layered theme, playing on RSVP as well as the ING rhymes.  And something not seen too often: four UTAHs (those block shapes that look like the state) in the grid.\n\nThen there’s the spark.  Every theme answer is a NYT puzzle debut, giving solvers new clues and answers to tackle. And when the puzzle’s bones are fresh, the whole puzzle shines.\n\nI was patting myself on the back, because before uncovering the revealer or reading its clue, I not only saw the rhyming start to the theme answers, but the RSVP as well.  That gave me all the elements I needed to guess the revealer, a skill I’m weak at and trying so hard to improve on.  But I didn’t get it!  I was looking for something more complicated, I think.  Oh well.  Small steps.  \n\nThat didn’t dull my enjoyment of this puzzle in the least, however.  There was even a most lovely moment where the cross of ARTIST and ROTUND (of ROTUNDAS) immediately drew to mind Fernando Botero.\n\nWill is a pro’s pro, one shy of 50 NYT puzzles, and Jeffrey is becoming a staple, with six Times puzzles in eight months (Hi, @Nancy J!).

Memorable from Pulp Fiction, & what a great voice, & I also remember him from the not-too-acclaimed movie \"Patty Hearst\", it was watchable though, & had one of the most innovative interesting soundtracks ever, by Scott Johnson. I had the LP.  Scott Johnson would take human speech, its vocal intonation, & play guitar etc to it in a way that brought out its melodicism & tonality, then play w/the sound, orchestrate it etc. The two 🎶pieces from PH (in which VingR played one kidnapper) that stood out for me are \"Mom, Dad\", where Scott Johnson takes Patty Hearst's (Natasha Richardson) recorded message to her parents (\"I'm not being starved, beaten, or unnecessarily frightened…\") & plays instruments along w/its tonality & it becomes an incredible dramatic haunting heart-rending piece. \"Closet\", a musical interlude w/no vocals, is also haunting.\n\nIn Johnson's album \"John Somebody\", he plays along w/recorded speech, including a wonderful segment where he plays along w/laughter.\n\nHis PH score is a main highlight of that movie (esp the 2 pieces I mentioned) but it does have fine actors & performances as well, even if the movie wasn't overall all that special.\n\nMy Ving comment became a tangent!\n\nI knew \"Ving\" was for \"Irving\" but didn't know till @Vaer's comment that Stanley Tucci dubbed him that!
