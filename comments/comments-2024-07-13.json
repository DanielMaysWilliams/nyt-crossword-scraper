At least, if I can retain what I learned, I am. \n\nI first learned about WPA programs about 30 years ago (where did the time go? Feels like yesterday!) when I was the editor of a community newspaper, and I did a story on a WPA artist in our area. A few years later, I did a cover story on another WPA artist who lived across the street from him. Both are well known, but the second one is much more famous...you've see his sculptures at the FDR memorial in DC... in fact, the first artist was his model for the first person in line at the Breadline. George Segal was such a charming man, and he gave me a tour through his chicken coops, which were turned into his art studio (yes, both artists had this in common, too); probably one of the three best interviews of my career.","createDate":"1720889087","updateDate":"1720968056","approveDate":"1720889091","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134651993","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.8942867517471313}
