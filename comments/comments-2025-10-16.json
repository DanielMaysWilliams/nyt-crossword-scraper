I love these kinds of themes, and it can’t have been easy to find all these words that you can take ICE out of and still have words (or crossword clues in the case of SLR).

The fill was pretty solid.\nMy only nit/observation is that since Lincoln was one of the first Republicans (apparently he didn’t found it as I had heard) it would be hard to imagine that it was the GOP (Grand OLD Party) when he was leading it. I looked it up, and that’s true; although it apparently started being called the GOP as early as the 1870s when it still was not very old. I’m not going to berate anyone about the clue, it just made me smirk a bit.\nNEAT idea all around, and for me a nice relaxing solve after yesterday’s which was a little more taxing.","createDate":"1760582891","updateDate":"1760639207","approveDate":"1760582892","recommendations":20,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145964690","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.924355685710907}

Yes, you have to imagine ICE in the answer, but there is nothing, like Sunday’s scissors, to tell you where it goes.  \n\nThat’s a marvelous riddle to crack!  The gimmick hit me with a delectable “Oho!”.  \n\nThe Puzzle battled me on another front – no-knows – of which I ran into more than a few.  They created barren white spaces that lingered until I cracked the ICE.\n\nAlong the way there was beauty: WEND, DROLL, ABSCOND, THRUMS.  And lovely touches by Kareem to have the ICE-less words still be actual words, to have the theme answers be symmetrical, and to have two revealers.\n\nPotent and Pleasing, a worthy Thursday.

The date is Sept 16th 2016 Ian Livengood. Stop here if you don’t want a spoiler\n.\n.\n.\nThe revealer was in three parts and was ANAGRAM THE FIRST WORD IN EACH CLUE. And that’s what you needed to do. Not just the Downs, or the Acrosses—but Every. Single. Clue. Of course you couldn’t solve the revealer without figuring the trick out first, so it was no use. There was no other hint to the trick except eventually noticing how squirrelly the clues were—I got it with “Manila alternative in a guessing game” (Animal—the answer was MINERAL). You’d think once you figured out the anagrams the clues at least were straightforward—but NO. Here’s some examples: “Trains (strain) for an NHL game”—OCANADA. “Reigns (singer) at a music hall” —BOCELLI.\nSomehow I got through this one without figuring out every anagram. I shudder to imagine the comments (they didn’t save them that far back). But bottom line before I complain about a too tricky Thursday I will remember this one, and while I will respect everyone’s negative comments as always going forward,  outwardly inwardly I will be thinking “Quit your whining it can always be worse”. Nothing can get more ridiculous than this one.","createDate":"1760615731","updateDate":"1760646741","approveDate":"1760615732","recommendations":7,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145968294","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-16","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.6206998825073242}

I especially loved all the clueing. I too loved the 28D clue that Deb mentioned.

I thought entomology or espionage, did NOT think \"I.T.\". Excellent. N(ice) epiphanies throughout.\n\nI caught on to the trick sometime in the middle of the solve, I forget at which clue, so in my mind I then included/added \"ICE\" to the asterisked clues and it really helped.\n\nSo overall, I thought this puzzle was a good'n to make one stirred but not shaken. Kareem crafted it wittily soda solvers can have a good time. Lots of droll, rye clues. Plenty of good, fun misleads, but with enough doable entries and crosses to scotch any overly wayward detours. A gin-uine delight. Smooth, challenging, chewy but not rocky. I bet even The Famous Grouse 'Eva H' might like this one. (OK maybe not).

When I first started doing these years ago, I would find out that there was a trick and get annoyed. Now I love the tricks.\nAnd if you folks think there are too many tricks in these puzzles, here's something that happened to me with a puzzle from another publication. These puzzles generally didn't come with tricks. So there I was and all the across entries were very straightforward and easy BUT they did not match with the down entries, which SEEMED equally easy. I was so frustrated. Back in the day we did these in the newspapers, so I had to wait till the next day for the solution. So the next day comes and I look at the answer puzzle and I swear, I thought my brain took a hike. NOTHING made sense. Slowly, ever so slowly it began to dawn on me--all the answers were BACKWARD. Sure enough the date for that puzzle was APRIL 1st!

Put yourself in the mind of the editors. They would usually not clue DRY as part of the title of an obscure rap hit from 2022, at least not without something else in the title that would point to it—whereas DRE is a pretty famous rapper even to me and once I got it, that would make sense to me why it would be a rap title. Of course sometimes there are things which are obscure to some people but obvious to others, but I do think using this type of logic helps sometimes figuring out the answers to clues.","createDate":"1760641175","updateDate":"1760703805","approveDate":"1760641176","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":145982068,"parentUserDisplayName":"Gallay","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145983180","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5805333256721497}
