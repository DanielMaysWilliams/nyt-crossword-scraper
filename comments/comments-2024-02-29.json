A friend (thought by some to also be a mean old lady) caught her husband of 40 years in a compromising situation with a very young, very attractive, female. She thought it over, then called the sheriff and asked if it‚Äôs a crime to destroy your own property. The sheriff said no ma‚Äôam, if your name is on the title, legally you can do whatever you want so long as you don‚Äôt harm anyone or someone else‚Äôs property in the process. So when the disgraced cheater finally came shuffling home, she didn‚Äôt say a word but she was ready. At that point, he was just thankful to be allowed through the front door and, not wanting to push his luck, disappeared to his man cave. As soon as he was out of sight, she started swinging her ax at his pride and joy, his Ford F150 pickup truck. \n\nShe‚Äôs not a petite lady and she was a woman scorned, so you can imagine the results. It was a small town, so of course everyone very quickly heard about what she had done and why. I always figured that the humiliation of having to be seen driving that beat-up truck around was far worse than anything else she could‚Äôve done to him.

Kate is deprived of food and sleep for several days.  He claims that nothing is good enough for her and berates his servants.  He sends away a Tailor who has made a fine selection of clothes for her.  (We see that he does care for her when he secretly pays the Tailor's bill.)  Some critics have said that this exaggerated carrying-on shows her how badly she used to behave and causes her to reform. I'm skeptical.\n\nExhausted and hungry she is taken back to town.  Petrucchio presses on, continuing to contradict Kate and Nature itself in the famous back and forth over whether it is the sun or the moon shining upon them or whether old Vincentio is a young woman.  She finally concedes.  (IV.6)\n\nIs the \". . .kiss me, Kate\" scene (V.1.132-141) the turning point?  I don't know.  But at a dinner with the three couples and the fathers, large bets are made as to which of the wives will obey their husbands.  This is where Kate wins the pot for Petrucchio and delivers a persuasive speech right out of the Great Chain of Being (V.2.141) including:\n\tThy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper\n\tThy head, thy sovereign, one who cares for thee  .  \n I doubt that she believes a word of it but is willing to play the game since her situation seems better than the others.
