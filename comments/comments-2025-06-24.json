So whether it should be banned is a moot question.\n\nSmoking is proveably harmful and often fatal.  Banning it would probably be as fruitless as trying to ban alcohol.  But increased prices and intense social pressure have relegated smoking to the fringes of society.  That's a big plus in my mind.\n\nThe same could work with alcohol.  Making it impossible to afford and a social faux pas would reduce the number of fatalities caused by it.\n\nThe flaw in your logic is that while smoking and alcohol consumption are addictions, going without a helmet or not wearing a seat belt are not.  People will more easily comply to helmet and seat belt laws because they are not being driven in the opposite direction by a compulsion.\n\nSkydiving?
