There’s no way to criticize a puzzle without getting a bit personal because if you don’t like a puzzle then you always feel that someone made bad choices about it.\nThat said I disagree with Andrzej and Caitlin about the difficulty of the trivia. I think a LOT are common names and brands in the US (which I understand would be off putting to Andrzej) and there are no major Naticks once you take that into account. Andrzej is entitled to his opinion about not liking puzzles with a lot of trivia or pop culture (and even many Americans would agree with him) but personally I think it makes for a much fresher and interesting challenge, then, say, yesterday, which had almost nothing objectionable but also almost nothing colorful (pun intended) or engaging.","createDate":"1762264187","updateDate":"1762298395","approveDate":"1762264187","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":146393645,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"146397565","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-11-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6359172463417053}

There are other KELSOs on the planet, though, so I can't be sure which one Barry was specifically referring to. I've also traveled extensively, including to all 50 states, so I know a lot of place names from all over the country -- and beyond. Yet I still encounter place names all the time, including in crosswords, that I am not familiar with. It doesn't bother me at all -- I consider such occurrences to be learning opportunities.\n\nI am sorry if you cannot understand what KELSO and STEAM have to do with Andrew's comment. Perhaps if you read what Andrew posted, very slowly, and then read what Barry wrote, also very slowly, and see if there's any way that Barry's comment is a logical response to what Andrew wrote, it might come to you. \n\nAlso: There is this wonderful machine out there called the Electric Google Machine.
