As I did today.\n\nJohn has been Mr. Sunday of late, with seven Sundays in the last year and a half. Often his grid designs have interesting features, like those three ascending plus signs in the box today.\n\nThere were some lovely answers along the way: POKY, GRIFT, PAEAN, POUFFE, TOTTERS, AS YOU DO, and FAINT OF HEART.

However, in common modern Polish ryt is no longer used, and it pretty much only exists in dictionaries. In its stead these days we would use either the word ceremonia (ceremony) or obrzęd.

I thought you might find it interesting that the initial spelling of the earliest 14th c. appearances of rite in English were with a ‘y.’ Here’s an anonymous Wycliffite complaining about Catholics and their rites (presumably including that of confirmation) in 1395: “Þe presthod of Rome is mad with signis, rytis, and bisschopis blissingis, and þat is of litil uertu.” (Clearly, King James and Samuel Johnson were the best things to later happen to English spelling.) Ironically, it was Wycliffe himself, Rome critic extraordinaire, who had been importing wholesale Rome’s Christian ritual vocabulary into our language to replace perfectly serviceable words for things like rite or ceremony. It sounds like obrzęd is akin to the Old English ġewuna. \n\nIn 1014, Wulfstan, the Archbishop of York had already lamented that, “þa ealdan gewunan syndon aworpene, and oðre ungelærednysse syndon underfangen”— “the old customs [were being] rejected, and other ignorances adopted [in their stead].”\n\nPlus ça change…","createDate":"1733654547","updateDate":"1733725468","approveDate":"1733654551","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138126085,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138126556","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5447478890419006}

Urząd means office, not as a place of work (that would be biuro, related to your bureau) but the office that services a government official. Eg. a ministry is the office of a minister as a member of the cabinet. Urządzić is to put things in order or arrange them, but also to make something happen, in some contexts. \"Urządzić mieszkanie\" means to furnish an apartment, \"urządzić wybory\" means to organize elections. Porządek is the sort of order you mean when you ask somebody to tidy up their room. Porządek publiczny on the other hand is public order.\n\nUrządzenie/przyrząd means device, and narzędzie means tool. \n\nOne can also przyrządzić posiłek, prepare a meal.\n\nApparently rząd comes from the protoslavic *rędъ - order, row.\n\nEnough geeking out, off to crush some climbing routes.","createDate":"1733656428","updateDate":"1733726077","approveDate":"1733656434","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138126556,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138126653","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.871675431728363}

Now, the spelling of rites in that sentence (rytis) *is* a perfect example of English before the GVS: The ‘y’ of rytis would have been pronounced as /i:/ (as in the Latin ritūs), whereas our modern post-GVS pronunciation has replaced the /i:/ with the diphthong /aɪ/ (as in our ‘rite’).","createDate":"1733677660","updateDate":"1733677661","approveDate":"1733677661","recommendations":0,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138126653,"parentUserDisplayName":"Sam Lyons","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138132485","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8371846675872803}

I tend not to crab over puzzles although I do occasionally complain about specific clues. I hope I don’t brag a lot but do talk about when I feel I am in sync with the creator, and occasionally note when I think a puzzle is easier than usual. I think it’s nice to hear from others about whether they think a puzzle is too easy or hard because it helps gauge your own reactions. I think pointing out errors or specific issues with clues may help other creators in the future. I agree with you I don’t like people trashing entire puzzles especially when they don’t give many specifics or their issues are more personal to themselves (“I don’t like pop culture or rap music” for example).
