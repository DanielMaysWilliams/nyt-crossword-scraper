I think this may be a Polish thing - our terminology regarding drinking glasses is much simpler: pretty much any glass is just... a glass (szklanka; the term for the *other* glass, as in the material glasses, window panes and bottles are made of is \"szkło\", which is also slang for drinking glasses, when used in relation to alcohol). An alcohol glass, and especially one with a stem, is called \"kieliszek\" (a diminutive of \"kielich\", from the German Kelch and Latin calix). But that's as far as it goes. If we want to specify a type of szklanka/kieliszek, we just say what it's for: szklanka do whisky, kieliszek do wina. There are no tumblers, drams, flutes, etc. So I may know what a tumbler is, but given my Polish neural pathways, it's not a word I recall naturally.\n\nI solved in Wed time BTW.","createDate":"1743484137","updateDate":"1743551462","approveDate":"1743484139","recommendations":8,"replyCount":10,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141052337","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-04-01","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7751039266586304}

Gotta get those billable hours! But at least I had the lawyer’s habit of carrying both red and black pens, so I could start in red and overwrite mistakes in black, if necessary. (It was always necessary.) Unfortunately, I was flying so much I was often stuck with a puzzle I’d already done, but at least frequency sometimes scored me upgrades, and in First a kind flight attendant might swap a used magazine for a fresh copy. How I hated prior cruciverbalists! I’m not sure which I minded more, the competent or the incompetent.

They didn't actually do anything. I'm not even exaggerating that much here. Even once prestigious newspapers, like \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" (\"Election Newspaper\", so called because it was established in 1989 by the democratic movement in the run-up to Poland's first semi-free elections in decades) have been reduced to tabloid levels.

I've always made myself do it because I don't want fear to stop me from experiencing life but at one point, it got nearly impossible. I didn't think I'd be able to make the trip to visit where my husband was born (Utila, Honduras) for the first time. It was awful. The anxiety had me pretty good too, as you say. I finally had to get help for it. So glad I did!\n\nNowadays, I mostly manage myself on regular commercial flights unmedicated, but a couple of years ago, trying to fly back from Honduras, everything went wrong and we had to fly on a puddle-jumper from Roatan to La Ceiba, then disembark, wait 30 minutes, and get back on, and fly to San Pedro Sula. \n\nWhen I first saw the tiny plane (like a 16 seater), I started to panic. We were traveling with my MIL, with severe dementia, and I was losing it just looking at it. I got on the plane somehow, tears streaming, but I lost it aboard.  I was sobbing and dropping F bombs, alternating with sorrys, whenever I could  get in a breath.. total panic attack. My poor husband was trying to guide me forward while tending his mom... He got her settled (gratefully, she was oblivious) and I was hyperventilating... I threw my purse at him, gasping, \"Xanax.\" He couldn't understand but the so kindly lady in front of us told him what she thought I was saying and he found my stash. She then started fanning me with her passport... of course it's also hotter than hades there.
