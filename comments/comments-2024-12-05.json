Would have liked to have had more of this one! I've never watched the movie but I had heard of it so once I had a few crosses the name came to me.\n\nIn the past year+ of doing puzzles, I have understand the joy and comfort they bring at difficult times And I'm happy to hear that they're helpin Mr Chalfin heal.\n\nI too was held up at gunpoint by two gunmen in 1991 in Milwaukee, WI. Ironically, we were heading to a place called The Safehouse, a spy themed restaurant downtown. They took my money with a loaded gun inches from my face while a cabby saw and honked. They ran and he chased them, radioing the police. They actually caught the guys. I had to identify them and ended up having to testify against them in trial. I was 21 and terrified. I was further terrified when I got notice a few years later that they were out of prison. \n\nI share because I'm grateful there is more help for these sorts of traumatic instances these days. I'm glad people can talk about it more and get access to help without being stigmatized. I never got help for the terror of what happened that night or the realization of what could have happened... Also was the gratitude of what didn't happen because of a brave cabby who was my hero that night. \n\nIt is definitely still with me in a not good way, but it also made me own my own life and make a huge change that my family was against. It was absolutely the right thing to do for me.

The themers are all examples of Cryptic-style clues; the main difference is that here the explanation is in the revealer, and in a Cryptic, it's in the clue.  Putting the instructions in each clue can make that clue cumbersome -- so you would never get such a clear, easy-to-parse clue as, say, \"Breaking down grammatically\".

In our case, a neighbor was about to exit the apartment building, saw what was happening through the door, and called the police. The gunmen saw him and fled quickly with our stuff. \n\nWe lived next to a print shop with security cameras so the next day we were able to help the police ID the perpetrator’s car in the footage. That helped lead to an arrest, though not until after the same group had done a string of robberies, some of which included home invasions, in the neighborhood. I am still so thankful that our neighbor had been there; otherwise who knows what might have come next. \n\nWe also went through the court process. It was so hard. Every court date, even the ones that got postponed because of defense attorney delay tactics, had us reliving the trauma.

That's why it's a puzzle, and not a test.  \n\nThis puzzle contains 78 answers.  Suppose you knew 39 of them outright, as if you were taking a short-answer test. You'd get a 50% on such a test. But with a crossword, you can use the crosses to fill in answers you have zero familiarity with (and get a 100%).  \n\nWith the answer INSIDE OUT, all of the crosses are fair,  only I AM is pop culture, and beyond that, only the crossword staple (and Brit gimme) ETON is the only proper name. So even a middling solver should be able to pick up enough letters in 62A to see that it solves to INSIDE OUT.  \n\nYou need zero knowledge of the movie to get to this point. It helps to have heard of it (I did, but never saw it), but even if you didn't, you should be able to get enough letters to figure it out.  \n\nYou can also use the theme answers to get the revealer...sorta solving INSIDE OUT. Since [Past issues to settle] immediately suggests OLD SCORES, but the answer is COLD SORES, you can see what kind of letter switch you need. After a few, you can see that the inside letters have to go to the outside. And voila, you have the revealer.\n\nKeep at it, and get better.

(I don't usually eat tacos on Tuesday.  Do you?)\n\nI don't practice MEATless Mondays simply because I love MEAT.  Maybe a little too much.  But cutting down on MEAT consumption, especially beef, is a good idea in general--for our health, our wallets, and our planet.   \n\nI fail to understand why conservatives have this kneejerk response to any progressive idea.  And I do mean little-p progressive, as in \"It's not a political plank.\"  It's rooted in the word progress, which I understand to be a good thing.","createDate":"1733429734","updateDate":"1733461611","approveDate":"1733429738","recommendations":10,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":138076422,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138077015","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.5892265439033508}
