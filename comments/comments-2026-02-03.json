Elvis was a truly great singer in his youth. Those Chess recordings, man, he was FIRE. And Adele has a great set of lungs. I love it when she shifts into top gear. T Pain with his auto-tune is a little hard to take, but as far as \"voices\" go his is extremely recognizable even if it isn't organically his own. And Kesha, formerly Ke$ha, while I don't go for her music I've kept tabs on her and find her immensely relatable, even if I have nothing in common with her: she was extremely hardworking as a musician and songwriter from early on, and her work ethic and ability to keep changing shape and keep putting out albums, podcasts, writing songs, collaborating, doing benefits, tours, specials, while getting sued by this person or that studio, while doing all the rash and ill advised things stars of her ilk do, is a source of admiration and inspiration for me: what a dynamo. Still I'd have liked a few more voices to have been jammed into this grid, like maybe six or eight total. A foursome feels a little lonely. \n\nGood to see some ancillary voices here, in Eagle (as in Joe Walsh, Don Henley, et al.) -- all originally recruited by Linda Ronstadt to be her traveling band, and all blessed with good outside voices. Been thinking about their no. 1 hit \"Lyin' Eyes\" recently. Wonder why? And \"Smile\" - Brian Wilson's late masterpiece.

Is it how you speak inside, as opposed to, say, shouting at a playground?\n\nDunno about the US but over here children - and adults - are not encouraged but required to keep quiet at libraries, and even whispering is frowned upon.\n\nTOTES reminded me how surprised I was for decades each and every time I saw American shopping bags in films and on TV - made of paper and without handles 😮 Especially the latter seemed so alien, and so inconvenient! Every time I saw them I thought: How do you carry several of those home? And sure enough, struggling with shopping bags has become an American TV trope, hasn't it?\n\nIt's not like our alternative was perfect, mind you - our shopping bags might have had handles, but they were plastic, and they contributed to pollution. These days single-use plastic shopping bags have been legally banned though, and we all use totes.\n\nSturdy, thick, plastic bags in bright colors, with logos and text in English, German or French, were smuggked into Poland from the West, and people considered them luxurious goods in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s.

That was great for me while I was trying to quit. (That didn't last long, though--it's not allowed by law.)\n\nSmoking is so bad. When I finally quit, it was all uphill. I didn't even think about it after three days. I could breathe better and became more active. I would walk five or six miles and then started jogging (in my thirties.) I lost twenty pounds eventually and was thin for the first time in my life.\n\nI've come to believe that smoking isn't even addictive. To be addictive, one of the qualities of a substance is that you have withdrawal symptoms when you stop. Like when you quit using caffeine, you might get a withdrawal headache. When you quit alcohol, there are withdrawal symptoms, too. Serious ones. But quit smoking--and it's all better. \n\nFrom the Cleveland Clinic:\n\n\"When you cut back or quit using nicotine-containing products, the lack of nicotine in your body can cause uncomfortable symptoms. But nicotine withdrawal isn’t harmful to your health.

Quitting smoking is harder than anyone who hasn't been through it can imagine.  And like alcohol, the addiction is always there, waiting.\n\nThe tobacco industry did everything it could to suppress studies showing that nicotine addiction is on a par with heroin, in some cases more so, and early on they even promoted cigarettes as a healthy means for weight loss. Back when I was in college in the 1950's and 60's almost everyone I knew smoked cigarettes.  My craving finally ended when I became allergic even to ambient cigarette smoke.\n\nQuitting was the best thing I ever did for my physical well being, and it made an extraordinary difference in my day-to-day life. No more chronic bronchitis (which had started at age 17!!), no more feeling cold all the time, better skin, more energy than I ever dreamed I had, myriad benefits were enormous once I was off them.\n\nYears ago, when I quit, I couldn't even talk about it. When my husband stopped smoking and was waling about how terrible it was for him, and hadn't noticed that I had not had a cigarette for a week, I actually picked up a chair and threw it at the wall!

If any of this community have never been to, or perhaps never even heard of, the Stratford Festival in the lovely town of Stratford, Ontario, you must make it your business — or pleasure, rather — to put a visit there — or even a sojourn — on your bucket list (or start one with this at the top).  The Stratford Festival runs from mid-April to late October every year (and sometimes extends very popular plays into early December), putting on about a dozen plays across four stages with a repertory company of actors.  There are always three or four Shakespeare plays, along with a couple of musicals — you must include any musical directed by the incomparably talented Donna Feore — and specially commissioned works, as well as at least one play geared for a younger audience.  Occasionally, they have been able to attract internationally known actors like Maggie Smith and Brian Bedford to grace their stages.
