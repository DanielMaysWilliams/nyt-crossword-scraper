After all, think about it—do you know of any ballads written about sailors with punitive tofurkey collars? \n\nThen there’s L’Albatross by Baudelaire, where the allegory is meant to make you feel for the poet’s alienation. Teen angst notwithstanding, I thought Baudelaire was a whiner and I felt for the actual bird instead. (Maybe those PETA and ASPCA memberships were preordained?)\n\nAfter that I didn’t think about albatrosses for 20 years until my husband got me to watch a documentary on them. Enormous, majestic birds who cover millions of miles in their lifetime, mate for life, and lay just one egg a year. I watched an albatross chick being fed. The mother had brought what was meant to be krill and jellyfish. Instead she poured clear plastic into her offspring’s throat. The birds mistake discarded plastic bags floating in the water for jellyfish, then inadvertently feed it to their young. \n\nI’ve been bringing my own paper bags to the produce section ever since. Recycling plastic bags in Europe is easier, but back home we’d fill a big box of them in the garage and cart it off twice a year to one of only 2 recycling facilities in Seattle metro that accepts this stuff. They make park benches out of it. Which is much better than feeding it to baby albatrosses.","createDate":"1750850997","updateDate":"1750929139","approveDate":"1750850998","recommendations":31,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143081152","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-25","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.47900792956352234}

Twelve of thirteen!

PET CAT and RESCUE brought my Wiley to mind – he is both – who I tremendously love despite being the hairball king of the world.

At least in all the ones I took the trouble to check, they were.  What an amazing construction coup that makes this -- though my solve wouldn't have been any different if the ACs hadn't been in the center.\n\nA very appropriate puzzle for the weather most of the country is going through right now.  I'm Exhibit A for staying home in AC:  I had an important post-cataract operation check-up appt scheduled at Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital yesterday when the air quality was very bad, the humidity was off the charts and the temps were over 100.  It was a NYC record.  I cancelled it the day before.  I didn't give them a choice and they didn't give me a hard time.  But I couldn't get another appt for two weeks -- condemning me to two MORE weeks of eyedrops before (hopefully) then being tapered off (two more weeks after that?)  I've now been on these drops and others since April 22.\n\nBut emergency situations call for drastic action.  My philosophy:  The best vision in the world won't do me any good if I'm dead of heat stroke.  What's happening to the climate now is shudder-making.  I just hope Iran doesn't decide to take down our power grid.\n\nI thought this was a pretty easy rebus as rebuses go -- made immediately obvious by MAGN[AC]ARTA.

Alas, I had almost nothing in the grid, it being so trivia-heavy. I can't remember when last I had so little in a puzzle that was not a Friday or Saturday. When I revealed the two crossing trivia entries, I had no way of knowing the cross would be a rebus. Since my grid was largely empty in that quadrant, I started doing reveals of trivia, and voila.\n\nConfidence is one of the things I have in overabundance. But confidence means nothing when you're faced with near-empty space.\n\nMy complaint was about crossing two trivia entries on a themed square. It is quite common for solvers to look up trivia. Crossing trivia on a themed square increases the chances of the theme being unwittingly spoiled for many people. My case was not quite as bad as that, as I had already figured out the AC theme in MAGN(AC)ARTA and SANT(AC)CLAUS, but still, I did not like what happened there.\n\nAlso, I very rarely stumble on a Wednesday puzzle, and in fact, this is my favorite day of the week at NYT games.

I am a very well educated (with a doctorate to show for it), reasonably well-read and well-travelled person in my 40s. I have a wide range of interests. I have been following international news for some 35 years. I listen to music, sometimes for hours daily. I shop, I cook. Yet I don't know many *Polish* singers from the 1960s, or recognize the ones I do know by their song titles. I am unfamiliar with many *Polish* brands. Crossing an artist from before I was born with a brand would have probably stumped me even in a Polish context. To me, personally, that does not seem fair. And, since there may be no objective measure of fairness when it comes to such matters, I have to leave it at that 🤷.","createDate":"1750843070","updateDate":"1750914291","approveDate":"1750843071","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143078273,"parentUserDisplayName":"Andrzej","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143079543","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-25","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5222064852714539}

Once they accomplish that, the process repeats until the team scores or is unsuccessful.\n\nIf a team runs a regular play on fourth down, which is to say they run or pass the ball forward, and is unsuccessful, the opponents take over at that point on the field.\n\nIf they are close enough to their opponent's goalposts, a team can attempt to kick the ball, held by a teammate the tall way on the ground, through them for a field goal (3 points). If it's too far away to attempt a field goal, the team has one more option: to PUNT. \n\nPUNTing is when the team on offense kicks the ball, dropped from the punter's hands and kicked before it hits the ground, as far away as possible within the field of play.  The purpose of this is to relinquish the ball to the other team, but to pin them back deep in the other end of the field, so that as they come on offense, they're practically the whole length of the field away from the opposing goal line.  Good punters can kick the ball a good 50-60 yards,\n\nFiguratively, one PUNTs a decision down the road or until later for similar reasons: to create distance, because they don't want to handle it, etc.","createDate":"1750856142","updateDate":"1750896713","approveDate":"1750856142","recommendations":13,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143079534,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jane Wheelaghan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143083645","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-25","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8555858135223389}
