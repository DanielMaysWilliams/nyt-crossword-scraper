First I'd look through all the box scores to see if anyone got a triple-double in the NBA or hit for the cycle in the MLB.\n\nThen I'd turn to the crossword answer key and fill in the crossword from the previous day if my parents hadn't finished it yet.

No, of course not. I was learning new words. Was it solving? Sure it was.\n\nI stopped doing the puzzle after High School and picked it back up a year or so ago. After a few months I was able to do seven days a week. I don't look anything up. If I come to my wits end, I click Check Puzzle and correct my mistakes. I consider that failing the puzzle, though.

I take it that few of you would nominate Mr. Kwong's puzzle for Puzzle of the Year? Anyone? Luckily, I imagine Kwong has a healthy ego, but if it was some kid's debut effort, think how mortifying that would be to be met with such negativity. I'm not being a scold, but please do consider that before posting.\n\nThat reminds me! As you may know, it's POY time, and we have quite a few nominees, but we could always use more. So, please take time to review 2024's puzzles and make your picks (as many as you like in as many categories as you like). You can put them in \"Replies\" below this message and either Eric Hougland, Cat Lady Margaret, or I will log them in the nominations: date of puzzle, name of constructor, and (optional) comments on why they're so good. This is a way to honor all the efforts the authors, editors and us solvers have made over the last year, and as you know, this is a very welcoming, earnest and enthusiastic community, so please do participate, especially you regulars and very especially you lurkers. \n\nI liked this puzzle a lot. Coffee is just the best, although to some, like cilantro, it tastes like S_ _ _.  I'm  a coffeeholic, but the only way I'd consume instant is if I was in the desert and literally dying of thirst. And even then it would be a tough choice.

In the case of ILIUM crossing SIMMS, there really is no other letter besides M  that looks right there.  That is often the case.  You can test each letter in your head and make your best guess.  If it turns out you're wrong, oh well, not a perfect solve today, but you still did the puzzle on your own.  I think that exercises your brain and trains you better than getting outside help.  Just my opinion.  For new solvers, taking breaks before resorting to outside help will enable you to improve faster.  You may well still need to look things up to get unstuck, but that's something you can wean yourself off as you become more experienced.","createDate":"1734345854","updateDate":"1734373735","approveDate":"1734345858","recommendations":10,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138316929","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5045716762542725}

The colors were really quite beautiful, in a very horrible way. \n\nThe day after my fall, feeling achy and grumpy and afraid of the outside, I decided to order groceries for delivery.

You must have had some kind of crazy fun last night!\" It was so crazy of a response that I couldn't help but laugh. \n\nOh yeah, the puzzle! Nice one! Fast and enjoyable. A gentle way to start my first day back at work after 8 days off, while I sip my poison of choice, Diet Coke. \n\nI absolutely loathe coffee of any sort, but a theme around diet soda would probably be weird. The smell is loathsome to me and the taste even worse. If you even put a half teaspoon of ground coffee in a chocolate sheet cake recipe, I will taste it and utterly reject it. Sometimes I wonder if I actually have an allergy to it (or maybe it's a gene thing like cilantro tasting like soap to some people) since it is so distasteful to me. \n\nOn the other hand, I adore cilantro, especially with avocado.

I think the issue was that the puzzle design erected barriers between the clever, challenging, solving bits that themselves weren‚Äôt clever or fun.  It just added friction and while that friction did make the puzzle harder to solve in a technical sense, that extra ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù didn‚Äôt enhance the experience in any way.  The silver didn‚Äôt feel smarter or rewarded for going through the extra steps.\n\nIt was akin to making solvers translate clues from a codex before they could read them.  Making solves translate the meter S to the letter B is an extra step, but it doesn‚Äôt require any smarts to do and doesn‚Äôt add to the experience, it‚Äôs just an extra tedious step.

Being glad or proud not to know entire spheres of culture is incongruous to good puzzle solving.\n\nPosts rife with \"I refuse to...\" and \"I'm not wasting my time with...\" irk me.  For some people, sudoku is a better fit.\n\nAs for cheating, I don't have anything against people solving however they want to.
