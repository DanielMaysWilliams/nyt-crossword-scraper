Even the downs ATLOWEBB and ONIONSKIN gave me pause. It didn’t help I had a few bad first guesses on downs also, like DAMN before DUMB, IRAN before OMAN, things like that—unusual for a Tuesday for me. Ultimately I finished all the long themers before the revealer, and the revealer last, so was done before I had time to appreciate the theme. But I do like it.\nA few nits—I feel like the clue for RARIN ought to have some signal for informality or contraction, and the revealer is informal as well—I know it needed to be symmetrical, but it seems like properly it needs to be “there ARE no two ways about it”—to the point where I actually tried there’R no two ways…” before getting the S in SARA (which I didn’t have originally). I’m not saying break or don’t use the revealer over it—I assume some people do say this incorrectly or informally—it just bugs me, and I feel like the clue should have added “colloquially” or something to admit it was grammatically incorrect.

I was fortunate enough to have taken art history, which I did as an excuse to get off-base housing, and so the art-related answers weren't hard to get.\n\nI'm definitely old enough to remember that our new-at-the-time TV set had two rotary channel switches, and that the main switch had 2-13 plus a U which made the second switch active so you could select your UHF channel.\n\nAnyway, despite the minor struggle, I thought it a good challenge for a Tuesday.

I didn't say any of that. I in fact struggled with the top themed clue and this was well above my Tuesday average time.\n\nPerhaps you didn't read the same mean and hostile comments I did. I have no problem with people sharing their puzzle experiences, good or bad. However I stand by my statement that it's not cool to personally attack a puzzle constructor or be aggressively mean and cruel.","createDate":"1767773133","updateDate":"1767789217","approveDate":"1767773135","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147840368,"parentUserDisplayName":"Carrie","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147841883","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-06","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7286944389343262}
