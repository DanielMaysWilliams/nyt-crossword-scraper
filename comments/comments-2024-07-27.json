I hate making one pass through the grid, having like three answers entered, and just having to turn autocheck on and roll with it. \n\nThough they’re not necessarily Naticks, TIG Notaro and WIM Wenders made it extremely difficult to get a foothold in their respective regions. (Seriously, I feel bad for these people. Who named them?!). You also have a golf apparel brand and “guess what the hell I mean” non-clues like, “Unlike this answer,” that make me roll my eyes in disgust. \n\nThe rest of the grid wasn’t bad, necessarily, but there is just no way I would ever have gotten some of these answers without being able to guess and test letters. Too many answers like NOTAR, ALT-comedy and KEG stand crossed with TEAL, ERST, KIVA and NORA. Even with _IVA and _OTAR, I wouldn’t have gotten them right. I had LOTAR and no idea what to put in for KIVA, so I just ran the alphabet until K worked. \n\nThe only cool thing I will remember from this puzzle is Islam means “submission.” That’s a fun factoid. \n\nI just am tired of Saturdays basically coming down to knowing the trivia or not. The clues are just too unhelpful for you to make much headway for the trickier answers, and if you don’t know the name of some foreign movie star or bad comic, you won’t be able to make much progress.

After all, the filled-in result is not nearly as awful as the process seemed at the time.

All things considered, it's quite a grown-up grid and the pop culture names weren't nearly as numerous as they seemed at the time.\n\nNevertheless, I was planning to throw the puzzle, SPLAT, into my wall during the entire solve (once I finished with the very easy NW) as I'm thinking: \"I can stare at this clue until the cows come home and I'm never gonna get it.  And this one.  And that one.\"\n\nThe one thing I wasn't tempted to do was cheat.  Cheating is what I do when I'm having great fun with a puzzle and need to cheat in order to be able to continue the fun I'm having.\n\nWhen I finished -- miraculously without cheating -- and realized the puzzle was mostly pretty good and I simply had found it much too frustrating to enjoy, I asked myself:  Would the constructors have had any way to know that?  After all, you can't test-solve your own puzzle since you already know the answers.  And I thought: No -- they couldn't possibly have known that.\n\nI have a hunch that this puzzle will prove as \"divisive\" as yesterday's pizza topping.

Unlike Friday’s puzzle, very little of this was in my wheelhouse, so the puzzle presented a nice challenge.  I started later than usual and as the clock ticked toward midnight, I still had gaps in the NE, SE, and NW.  I thought I was going to have to set the puzzle aside and sleep on it, because I feared I might turn into a pumpkin at the stroke of 12:00.  As soon as I made that decision, the NE corner came to me, and then almost immediately the SE and, like clockwork, the SW. CARNIVORE, for someone to have a beef with was the key to unlock that sector.  So I went to bed satisfied by the stiff challenge.\n\nMy knowledge of birds helped me immensely.  I got TEAL right off the bat, and WRENS was even easier.  We have a hollowed out gourd hanging from our front porch ceiling, and every year a house wren comes and stuffs it with a ton of small twigs to make the most jumbled nest imaginable.  After working tirelessly for several days, he perches atop the gourd and sings his babbling teakettleteakettleteakettle song all the live long day.  When he successfully attracts a mate and raises a brood of young, it is a joy to sit on the porch and watch the pair diligently hunt for food and bring it back to feed the begging young, and a triumph when the little ones fledge.  We’ve named him Gordie and her Gordita, although they’re indistinguishable, after their abode.","createDate":"1722078903","updateDate":"1722141214","approveDate":"1722078906","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"134999453","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-07-27","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6009759902954102}
