It wasn't oppressive, I guess, because the state actually provided the majority of people with enough to survive, including jobs and housing. Nobody thrived but few people starved. Yet compared to people in the West, we were all paupers. The prosperity of Austria, which I saw in 1988, was like something out of a fairytale. The houses of regular Austrians seemed like mansions, to me, and the displays of grocery shops (where we couldn't afford to shop) brought to mind the fantastical arrays of food described in the tales of 1001 nights.\n\nWe all experienced all new levels of poverty in the early 1990s, when the new democratic governemnt subjected the country to the shock therapy of introducing market economy practically overnight - in the end it turned out to be effective, but many people actually starved for a few years, before those who adjusted to the new system finally began to reap its benefits.
