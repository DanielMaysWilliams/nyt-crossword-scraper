I had ELSE (thinking of computer logic) before ERGO for a long time, and I couldn’t get my head around RESTON for the literal meaning of surmount for awhile, but got there too eventually. But I couldn’t get past ITS instead of TIS, and had CEELO in my head instead of OCELO, so I was left with ACAIBUTTER which I was skeptical of as a dairy product but couldn’t get around. And despite what I thought was a decent background in math and AP calculus, GALOIS was a total unknown to me. And only just this second did I figure out that ACTIONHERO meant James Bond and not some funky nickname for a well-performing investment. So I finally succumbed and looked up CEELO to find out while he did write a SpongeBob song he is not a brand of sponge.\nWell done!

Finally, finally, harkening back to the good ol' days, when puzzles were real puzzlers. I thought Will must have had a change of heart and decided to part with some of the NYT's big bucks, this being Byron's 109th puzzle for the Times. \n\nThen I started to work on the puzzle, which elicited the expression \"Be careful what you wish for.\" It was tough! But wonderful! No rap artists, no real sports clues, just arcana like Gaulois. \n\nLike Caitlin, I started from the  very easy SE corner and worked my way up. Well, almost up. I was left with the middle. Fer cryin' out loud, I cut my young teenage teeth on Bobby Vinton and couldn't remember the first two letters of LONELY, even though every other word of the song was playing in my head. Ultimately, I was forced to look up ASH CARTER, and that first R gave my brain the jolt it needed to remember that it was MR LONELY. One and done. \n\nByron, thanks for the workout.

It’s more like going to another country.  It has its own distinct feel.  And I’m a fan of that feel.  Byron takes no prisoners.  He brings me to the edge of uncle, and man, it feels like a victory to enter practically every square. It’s a magnificent solve riddled with victories.\n\nToday: A 66-word, 21 block elegant grid (both these numbers ridiculously low), squeaky clean.  Okay, there’s THOS, but it’s easily saved by a terrific factoid clue.  Try filling a 66/21 grid, even ugly, and you will bow with respect at Byron’s talent.\n\nTwo things you can count on in Waldenstan:\n•\tFabulous original wordplay clues, like today’s [Smack in the middle of a crowd, in brief?] for PDA, and [Curve that’s high and outside?] for ARCH. Two bland answers given shimmer through wit.\n•\tDebut Times puzzle answers – 19! Nineteen!  I did the math, and three-quarters of the squares with letters belong to debut answers (.738%)!  Did your puzzle feel vibrant?  Welcome to Waldenstan.  My favorite debuts were TIGHT FIT, UNWAVERING, ROSE TO FAME, PRESS START, and the marvelous HEY ANYBODY.\n\nByron, you are such a credit to Crosslandia. Your puzzles sizzle.

Higher math and I are like oil and water.\n\nI was great in arithmetic in grade school, but when I got to JHS and had to take algebra, my eyes glazed over. Pulled through by the skin of my teeth and tutoring by the good-looking older boy next door. Then in HS it only got worse. I was on the verge of failing geometry when my teacher, Mr. Seinberg, made a deal with me: he'd pass me in geometry if I swore I'd never take another math class. Of course I agreed; I hated math. \n\nAnd then I found out that the college I wanted to attend had just put in a rule that trigonometry would be needed for acceptance. I had to go back to Mr. Seinberg with my tail between my legs and beg him to let me take trig. He made me audit it the first semester before taking it for credit during the second. It didn't end well. I did get into that college, but had to take it again there.

If by Natick you mean crossing words that a certain high percentage of solvers don’t already know, then GALOIS and LEASALONGA and maybe BOARDIES and OCELO are Naticks. But the real question should be (at least if you are going to complain about them) is whether an intellectually curious person should or would want know them? With the exception of OCELO I think that’s the case. I’m happy to learn that surfers wear board shorts and they are called BOARDIES. If I didn’t know who LEA SALONGA was I would be excited to look her up and learn about her accomplishments, which certainly go far beyond Disney movies. And I’m tickled to learn that despite a decent math background and more than my share of math lectures on the Great Lectures series, there’s an important mathematician I haven’t heard of and I’m grateful for the constructor explaining his work to me.

I love those clever and devious clues that when you figure out the answer you appreciate the guile and lateral thinking and how brilliantly it was clued. Another way to make a puzzle difficult is to fill it with obscure (to most) references, clues that don’t quite work, questionable fill. and green paint. To some, I guess this is what makes a fun puzzle, but not for me. chacun à son goût.\n\nGreen paint (multi-word answers that aren’t common phrases) are my personal puzzle peeve, and there was no shortage of these today: (HEYANYBODY, SEVENHOUR, OPENMOUTHS, PRESSSTART, BESTADVICE, BUTI[disagree], and more). In the category of obscure fill, a certain amount in a late-week puzzle is fine, expected even, but too much is just a way to make a puzzle difficult without making it interesting, clever, or fun. In today’s puzzle I think the line may have been crossed. Some examples from today’s puzzle (some of which I knew) there were: GALOIS, MRLONELY, OCELO, THOS, THEBARTMAN, LEASALONGA. Some of these (like MRLONELY) were derivable after getting enough letters.   I’d put HEXER into the bad fill category, but one or two in a puzzle is generally just an annoyance. \n\nThis puzzle also had some lovely clues like “Bond Classification” , but not nearly enough for me 😢.","createDate":"1755356372","updateDate":"1755405178","approveDate":"1755356373","recommendations":19,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144323386","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-16","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4631594121456146}

If you find it to be fun more often than it isn’t, sticking with it eventually pays off.","createDate":"1755351214","updateDate":"1755402995","approveDate":"1755351214","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144316150,"parentUserDisplayName":"Brandon","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144320655","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6503314971923828}

While the noun referring to a common food fish is of Scandinavian origin, the verb flounder, which dates to the late 16th century, is likely an alteration of an older verb, founder. The two verbs have been confused ever since. Today, founder is most often used as a synonym of fail, or, in contexts involving a waterborne vessel, as a word meaning “to fill with water and sink.” Formerly, it was also frequently applied when a horse stumbled badly and was unable to keep walking. It’s likely this sense of founder led to the original and now-obsolete meaning of flounder: “to stumble.” In modern use, flounder typically means “to struggle” or “to act clumsily”; the word lacks the finality of founder, which usually suggests complete collapse or failure, as that of a sinking ship.\"\n\nIn this clue, I think founder was the right choice.

Definitely, but delightfully, the toughest Saturday in recent memory. Mr. Walden’s puzzles can seem excruciating while solving—but somehow when looking at the finished grid, everything seems glaringly obvious! I absolutely never seek hints or look-ups for these puzzles, my thought being that if I can’t figure it out unaided, I haven’t earned the gold star, but gotta say today I was sorely tempted! Thankfully, I resisted, and eventually got to the music: so don’t give up too soon! (A clue referencing differential calculus adjoining one calling for a pop song from the sixties? Yikes!)","createDate":"1755346752","updateDate":"1755414417","approveDate":"1755346753","recommendations":9,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144316686,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144318503","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-16","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.4800921678543091}
