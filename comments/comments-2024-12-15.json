The missing back references or co-highlighting to show the corresponding artist fill when you highlighted one of the words with missing letters was a major editing mistake in my mind.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the \"extra\" letter in a couple of of the key fills was, itself, part of a tricky down fill (Model A or T? The C-What? Fems, Dems, THems, ...?? Wu-Tang??) and that you couldn't use the across fill to validate your guess, meant that decrypting the 10-letter \"evidence\" wasn't so much a punny reward for solving the puzzle as a necessary part of the punishment to finish it.\n\nThis just seemed to be too clever by half.

It was an extraordinarily clever puzzle, and I very much wanted to enjoy it. As is my WONT, I solved without paying much attention to the theme.  I caught on pretty quickly to the notion that the stolen painting clues were artists names and just started entering them when the crosses made the identity clear.  I assumed that the gimmick was that those answers would be missing the painter’s names, but I didn’t bother to check.  So whenever an answer appeared wonky I just ignored it unless the missing artist came immediately to mind.  I did find the unchecked letters somewhat annoying because they made the already mangled acrosses even more gibberishy.  I probably would have been ok with it, but I had a typo, and searching for it with all the nonsensical letter streams was headache inducing.  And to boot, I completely missed that the unchecked letters spelled IWASFRAMED.  TLDR: loved the concept. disliked the execution.\n\nOn another note, the puzzle put me in mind of a very fine book called The Art Thief by Michael Finkel.  It tells the story of Stephane Breitwieser, who pulled off an incredible series of art thefts in amazingly low tech fashion, and just kept the art in the attic apartment he shared with his accomplice girlfriend. The book marks a comeback of sorts for Finkel, whose career was long sidetracked by a plagiarism scandal, which gave him a certain affinity for his subject.  It’s a lively and entertaining read.","createDate":"1734230683","updateDate":"1734309183","approveDate":"1734230686","recommendations":21,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138300575","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-15","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9143890738487244}

I ended up printing out the filled-out grid, going through the clues to find the 10 pairs, circling those extra letters, and finally writing out the phrase, which was ultimately what led me to fixing those three mistakes.

All those painters' names were stolen, so they shouldn't have been in the answer key.  In those squares, the down letters should have been there.  This confused a lot of solvers, but that wasn't the puzzle's fault.  So what was the puzzle's fault?\n\nWell, what I find fault with is the crossing down letter.  The second I from IS INTO, for example.  We know that certain letters have been removed from the across.  But that's no reason to add an extraneous letter to the rest of the across entries.  So the down entries should have contained either:\n\na. a letter from the remaining across answer (that means the across answers would have been one square less, and 5D would have been something where either a T or an A (the two closest letters to the missing letters' part) belonged.  I know this is hard to explain, but 21A should just read EASTANDARDTIME, without an interloping I.  There are five letters missing, and no reason to add an errant I.\n\nor\n\nb. a blank space to represent the stolen letters of the across.  Thus, whatever crossed 21A would be complete in five letters instead of six, with that third space blank.  The software can handle it; it's been done before.  That would at least have made more sense.\n\nI like hard, but this one was hard and weird.","createDate":"1734243262","updateDate":"1734347062","approveDate":"1734243266","recommendations":35,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138301722","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-15","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7434080839157104}

My biggest gripe was that if I had the stolen painting clue entered having figured it out from the cross-clues, I had to go search through the clues to find that one. It should have highlighted it. That alone would have made it much much better for me. \n\nI didn't put it in as rebus at all, did that work? but understanding that the letter where the painting was stolen from was the cross clue only was confusing. It kind of goes against what a \"cross\"word is, so it was completely not intuitive.\n\nBy the time I figured it all out I was too frustrated and just looked up where to fix it. I had solved everything, but had not input it correctly, and that isn't a good puzzling experience. \n\nBut as I said, I really liked the idea, and the way the clues were done was fantastic.

It’s the first crossword all year where I’ve needed a scratch paper: if I hadn’t figured out the punny punchline, I might have never gotten all of those down entries. It’s hard because they don’t cross, but knowing there would be some “payoff” in the word they spell was at least like a mini cross. \n\nMy only issue actually has nothing to do with the mechanics. Instead, it’s an old mainstay of the Wordplay comments section: there are a bunch of naticks in this puzzle. OREL crossing LEHAR. SNERD crossing DARIEN. OKEEFE crossing MIRO and LEANNA crossing ERNST (though those, you could argue, have extra implicit crosses inherent to the conceit of the puzzle, so I’m giving them a pass.) UMA crossing ARTE (though I have to assume everyone knew at least one of those). And that’s to say nothing of the ones that aren’t technically naticks, but had proper nouns crossing what I personally found to be very esoteric vocab: ESME crossing POTASH, LILLE crossing OLIOS.\n\nAgain, I did finish, so I’m not grumbling about impossibility. I just found the last bits somewhat of a slog, as I button mashed my way through 2 or 3 squares where I knew no lightbulb moment was forthcoming.

About the only things in life I've done with equal consistency is love my child and breathe. \n\nI now have a new most-hated puzzle in this streak. In order to retain the integrity of the streak, I scrupulously avoid peeking or reading commentary until after I'm done - the only exception being the occasional spellcheck. Until today. What is meant by \"unusual 'one-way' rebus\"? Is this some newly invented rule that it's okay for clues to make sense in one direction while being rendered into meaningless gibberish in the other? Is it not the beauty of the rebus that it must make sense in both directions? \nI was so irritated that I relented, for the first time in almost four years, and read some of the commentary. Ms. Lovinger's assessment is incorrect, at least based on my mobile device. I filled in the cross clues (eg. ISINTO) based on her directive that \"it should be entered as normal\". Back to the puzzle, and upon completion, I received the \"So Close\" message. Only after I changed those squares to the makes-sense-in-one-direction-utter-nonsense-the-other rebuses did I receive the music and reveal. Maddening and ridiculous. \n\nOne last rant. Miro, O'Keeffe, Monet etc are painters, not paintings. AN O'Keeffe or A Monet can be stolen; you would never say to the police, \"O'Keeffe was stolen!\" or they might ask if you meant to report a kidnapping. \n\nMy streak may be intact, but this is the closest I've ever come to tossing it as no longer worth it.","createDate":"1734246611","updateDate":"1734351255","approveDate":"1734246616","recommendations":214,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138301875","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-12-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4494260847568512}

I’m in the camp that loves finding one like this that’s doing something quite out of the ordinary, and I don’t read solving notes in advance, so I worked it without the awareness that it was going to be trickier than usual. Though there was a LOT of having to keep track of things, my feelings about that were ultimately outweighed by the ahas (including SMOKEEFECTS and I WAS FRAMED). I had the same wish expressed by other commenters that the clue highlighting was bi-directional. I also think I would have found it more fun to have the frames that showed up around the I WAS FRAMED letters at the end be visible from the beginning. Having that art museum aesthetic would have added a nice visual element, while also making it easier to keep track of where I was inserting things, and—having put the idea of frames in my mind—might have enabled me  to use that great phrase as an actual cross-check of those tricky squares during the solving process, and simultaneously eliminating the not fun job of hunting for the letters that I’d entered in pencil format or left blank in order to figure out what they were supposed to spell.

While this was a very creative, original, clever amd (partially/ in theory) fun puzzle, I agree with you. I was definitely grousing towards the end (and the middle) wondering why they couldn't let us bookmark the connection between the artist & the scene of the crime, in BOTH directions. I kept having to troll thru the puzzle to find the artist associated w/the long missing-letters entry, def a bit unnecessarily tedious... def a LOT of flyspecking, it got to be kind of grueling. It was still worth it, & I'm glad I encountered & did this puzzle, but I think it was an unnecessary omission (by the editors, really, who have final say) and IMO it would NOT have made it \"too easy\" to simply highlight the connection in BOTH directions.\n\nI also felt there were some quite semi-Naticky spots, or upon second glance just muddy spots that were clogged up by that lack of any decent way to doublecheck the associated artist. I got stuck a lot on the whole FEMS/ SM[OKEEFFE]CTS/ TOYMEN knot in the East, only noticing NOW that tje 78D letter was C for COOKIE, duh; I'd kept veering toward LOOKIE and not knowing WHAT the H was goin' on there. But it was still all in all very satisfying to finish it.
