It's the second time you've mentioned this phenomenon, and I was wondering (after a short stab at googling with no clear results): Is the benefit of taking a break from a puzzle (or other mental task) the continued working of the brain unconsciously, which is what you mentioned a couple times— or is it kinda the flip side of that? I always thought the Eureka phenomenon, of seeing a different angle when you come back to a puzzle after a break from it, was the *releasing* of the mind from the repeated battering at the task, the *diversion* from or turning off of the attention from it, the *dis*connecting, that allowed one to come back at it refreshed with a fresh start and not remain stuck in whatever ruts one might've been mired in. I've always felt that, when I suddenly see a third possible synonym for a word in a late week puzzle after taking a long break, I've felt that it's because I'm starting kind of raw and fresh instead of trying to build upon preconceptions that I've amassed while in the middle of the previous session. That it was the actual *break* from it that was the benefit, a genuine break... not the mind continuing to churn away at it unrelentingly.\n\nIf you have links to support the \"brain doesn't take a break, it's actually still working at it and that's why you get the 'aha' moments\" take on this I'd love to see them! It's interesting either way.
