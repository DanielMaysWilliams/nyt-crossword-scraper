It’s never been done before.  It involves wordplay and is capped with an aha revealer.  The theme answers have zing.  And they are fresh – one has appeared only three times in the 80 years of NYT puzzles, and the others less than that, including answer debut LOBSTER ROLL.\n\nBravo on that, Tim!\n\nPlus, there were little things I liked:\n•\tWonderful answer set for a Monday puzzle, with very few if any no-knows.\n•\tELSIE echoing yesterday’s GLUE.\n•\tLovely answers, CLINCH, CHUCKLEHEAD, STAVE, CLARET.\n•\tO-tail row two, with NERO, CREDO, INFO, buttressed by nearby wannabe EMO.\n•\tON THE GO abutting GONE.\n\nAnd a big thing I liked.  I actually guessed the revealer before uncovering it!  This is an ongoing challenge for me, something I’m weak at.  But, THROW SHADE hit me, and I wondered, “Could it be?  Could it be?”  And it was!  So, this is going to be a very good day.\n\nCongratulations on your debut, Tim, and thank you for a basket-of-goodies outing today!","createDate":"1725881713","updateDate":"1726113812","approveDate":"1725881718","recommendations":37,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"136039206","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-09-09","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9683563709259033}

The very first NYT crossword--Feb. 15, 1942--started with the clue \"Famous one-eyed general\" at 1A, which solved to WAVELL, and contained, among other proper nouns, the name of three Pharoahs (USERTESEN), an Italian poet laureate from the 16th century (TASSO), an ethnic group from the SW Philippines (SULUS), a Canadian strait (CANSO), the German name for Geneva (GENF), an island off of New Guinea (MISOL) and a spirit worshiped in Thailand (NAT).  Most of these are ridiculously obscure.\n\nJust as many people prefer more names over common nouns as vice versa.\n\nI am a fan of baseball but would rather not have seen the implementation of the designated hitter, as it takes away from the strategy of the game. But it's been put into full force now in both leagues and things aren't about to change.  I can moan about it all I want, or I can just get over it and enjoy the game anyway.

You've probably come across it with Venn diagrams.  Like there's a set of all US Presidents, and a set of all US Senators.
