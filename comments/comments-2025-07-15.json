I knew it had to do with D-B but that didn't click. Sweet little surprise there at the end. \n\nI just came from reading some sports articles on The Athletic. In the comments the regulars insult each other and hurl curse words about with abandon -- and not much monitoring. It's pathetic. Not amusing in the least. Yet here, among people who love words and their magic, we are over-monitored to an extraordinary degree -- the emus are techy and the human editors nearly as intolerant. But the Athletic and Games are subscription services, but we are held to different standards. In the regular Times, some columns and articles have comments, not others. There's no guessing why. Some comments get delayed for hours before they appear, without any explanation, or never appear, especially if they are critical of the author's postulates. Others, like the ever-present \"Socrates\" get put up right away. It's all so cockeyed.

I've never thought how one would spell that bit). Yaaaay. I had to look up the name of the actor.\n\nI owe not being stumped by RUBADUB (which also crossed the actor's name...) to mishearing Rick's of Rick & Morty catchorase. To quote R&M Wiki: \n\n\"Wubba Lubba dub-dub\" is Rick's iconic catchphrase, frequently used in Season 1, and initially seems to be an expression of Rick's happiness or humor. However, as Birdperson later explains, in the Bird People's native language, it translates to: \"I am in great pain, please help me.\" \n\nI generally found this puzzle tedious.

I have made the decision that I'm not up to going this year, but if you go I might reconsider. \n\nI know most of the guys you see featured in the 6-minute video. (No, I'm not in it!). Sadly, the one who introduces those we lost in the past year, Danny Riggs, who you see speaking starting at 2:15, left us a few weeks ago. WHen I attended the retreat two years ago he was one of the ones who really made me feel welcome. He's a great guy and it was a great loss. \n\nThe guy you see doing most of the speaking is fellow Mainiac Trevor Maxwell. Another great guy. \n\nI hope you consider going to the retreat but, even if you don't it's still a great organization for guys like us.","createDate":"1752639084","updateDate":"1752641013","approveDate":"1752639086","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143560533,"parentUserDisplayName":"Robert Michael Panoff","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143566690","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-15","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.643362820148468}
