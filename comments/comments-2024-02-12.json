It is conical. It may appear cylindrical from a distance, but it is in fact significantly narrower at the top than at the bottom. This is one of the things, in addition to the double reed, that makes the oboe's sound so distinctive from the clarinet, which is actually cylindrical. The conical bore is also one of the reasons the oboe is such an expensive instrument. The wood - usually grenadilla, sometimes rosewood - has to be especially hard and well-aged to withstand the conical boring process. Here is a fascinating video on how an oboe is made. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_xOj9bLkYVQ?si=D7SCdfB_pn09XYP9\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/_xOj9bLkYVQ?si=D7SCdfB_pn09XYP9</a>","createDate":"1707776444","updateDate":"1708090597","approveDate":"1707776446","recommendations":17,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"131120532","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-02-12","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7294676303863525}

Modern flutes are conical (especially the head joint); early flutes are inverted cones (tapering strongly to their feet).
