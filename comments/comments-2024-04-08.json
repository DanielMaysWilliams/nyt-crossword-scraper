For those of a certain age who might remember the long-running television soap opera \"The Edge of Night,\" whose opening showed an animation with a line of darkness sweeping over a city, that's exactly what I was reminded of as we were enveloped by the moon's umbral shadow. Once you actually experience it for yourself, it becomes easy to understand why this sight was so terrifying to ancient people. \n\nAlong with the sudden darkness came a change in the clouds' color. Behind the forward-moving edge of the moon's shadow were strange and exotic colors. The dull gray suddenly became yellow-orange and tints you'd see while looking through a beer or iodine bottle. Indeed, along the very edge of the disappearing sun at the start and end of totality, an arc of ruby red or fuchsia associated with the solar chromosphere appeared. It looked bright red because the hydrogen in the sun was emitting a reddish light at high temperatures, and some of this light may become evident in the clouds at the beginning and end of totality. \"\n \n<a href=\"https://www.space.com/what-if-it-is-cloudy-for-total-solar-eclipse-april-8-2024?u\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.space.com/what-if-it-is-cloudy-for-total-solar-eclipse-april-8-2024?u</a>","createDate":"1712589583","updateDate":"1712630845","approveDate":"1712589585","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132399537","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-08","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.837414562702179}

Happily, this means the revealer on Mondays is almost always \"below the scroll\" out of sight. \n\nSo when I hit the second theme clue this morning and realized there was a musical connection, I started getting excited that Bonnie Tyler might make it in. How cool that her hit was the revealer!! Teenaged G was a *huge* fan -- the drama! That video! Aahhhh!\n\nEven better, my weekday soundtrack is supplied by WFUV, and all the DJs today were picking up on the eclipse theme as well. So many great tunes, here in the puzzle and the column and there on the airwaves -- it was a synchronicity/wavelength moment for sure. \n\nI spent the afternoon in a graveyard with hundreds of other Brooklynites (the incredible Green Wood Cemetery, who did it up right).

Just got back from my ECLIPSE jaunt. There was the most traffic I've ever seen on I-95 north of Old Town; heading there is almost always very little traffic once you are north of the Stillwater Avenue exit in Old Town. Today, it was like Massachusetts traffic. \n\nWhen we got to the Medway exit, where one gets off the highway to head west to Millinocket, the exiting traffic was backed up all the way onto the right travel lane for about a half mile. Scoping out the situation, we decided to abort Plan A (Millinocket) and go to Plan B (Milo/Brownville). That meant sitting in that exit line, on the line acrid the overpass, to get to the southbound entrance. Not too bad -- the police were prioritizing getting the backed up cars off the interstate so we lost no more than 10 minutes. \n\nWe got to Milo and found a little museum with rest facilities and extensive grounds where we parked and set up. And bathrooms! \n\nThe down side was that Milo is close to the edge of the zone of totality, so we had only a little more than a minute. Cf. about 3 minutes at Millinocket. But, we decided this was good enough and set up our chairs and pulled out the cooler and snacks and tied the dogs up. \n\nIt was lovely, if short. And what a view of the corona we had! It was stunning. Jupiter and Venus were clearly visible in the dark sky around the sun. \n\nOverall, it was a great trip north followed by some great Thai food, and then home. \n\nHighly recommended.","createDate":"1712622936","updateDate":"1712693734","approveDate":"1712622938","recommendations":14,"replyCount":2,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132417043","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-08","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.4429935812950134}

I wish I lived closer to the path. \n\nI bailed on my trip. I could have met up with some friends who got a room in Waterville, with the plan to drive toward Jackman on 201.
