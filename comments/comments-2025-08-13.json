In the end I found that as usual, the original (book) is superior to the adaptation, but I was surprised by how much the movie added to my sense of understanding the book. Actors playing multiple roles across the different novellas helped cement the reincarnation theme for me that is only hinted at in the book. If you enjoyed the movie then I highly recommend the book, or better yet the Random House audiobook production with different narrators for each novella.\n\nI hope to see ROBERT FROBISHER appear someday in a puzzle, but I was very pleased to see CLOUD ATLAS today!","createDate":"1755057757","updateDate":"1755122625","approveDate":"1755057758","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144237414,"parentUserDisplayName":"Marshall Walthew","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144238527","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.824293851852417}

Somewhat related and probably more worrisome, I sadly see this with students using AI in varying ways in their writing (which as a professor and journal co-editor is something I lose sleep over.)\n\nAnd it's not just overusing some incredibly annoying semi-meaningless puffed-up words when shorter words would be far better, but it's a vacuous style of writing/sentence structure that I'd only describe as the UNCANNY VALLEY (which I think is typically applied to AI images or Stepford Wife types but feels perfectly right here as well.) \n\nTeachers all over the world are trying to work around this issue by, say, having students write essays in class, but it's a massive problem that will likely have effects we can't fully predict or understand. Like, IDK, perhaps we will all get a little or a lot dumber, less creative, less fun, less authentic, etc.\n\nAs an optimist I can try? to hope it will lead to a pendulum swing where really good writing stands out even more against a backdrop of AI nonsense, but as a realist, I'm not at all sure that's what will happen as the number of people who appreciate good writing will also shrink.\n\nI've taken to giving students extra points for cleverness or humor or even grammar errors because at least I know they are using their own words. \n\nCheers?

The challenge is usually screening out the dreck and the crosswordese as much as possible. The common words are just common because they have common letters or letters in certain order. Obviously OREO for a lot of vowels. ENYA because sometimes you need a Y in an odd place. Short words with a more unusual letter are quite valuable and necessary sometimes, like KIA say.\nAs for something like SEA OTTER I think there is a recency bias. There are tons of words in these puzzles and occasionally two slightly more unusual ones overlap in the same week, it’s just going to happen. When it does we remember it, and don’t remember when it doesn’t. It’s like the fact you only need 23 people in a room to have a 50 percent chance of having the same birthday.

When I construct and need to a use a slightly more unusual word that’s not common to my vocabulary I look to see how often it’s been used before both in the New York Times and elsewhere.

So if I were constructing and it came up in my software for the first I’d be more likely to be reassured it was ok if I saw it frequently vs. not.

Thanks, folks.\n\nTrue or False -- all your contentions about tricky clues  -- and there were a lot them -- none of them really addressed the opinion that I was surprised a particular clue was not mentioned in the tricky clues section.\n\nCan you not see that there a lot of items in the tricky clues section that are simply ones that some might find hard?  (if you don't answer any other question in this reply,  please answer this one)\n\nGiven that, can you not see that a particular clue that many did not know, might surprise someone when it is not mentioned in the tricky clues?\n\nHonestly, I really don't understand why you replied to my original post on Sunday at all, other than you seem to take great joy in naysaying the most innocent of claims.","createDate":"1755118998","updateDate":"1755132778","approveDate":"1755118999","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144243636,"parentUserDisplayName":"Jim","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144261819","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-13","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5647140145301819}
