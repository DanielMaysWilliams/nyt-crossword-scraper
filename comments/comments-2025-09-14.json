The original sound was a \"meep meep,\" recorded by animator Paul Julian, but \"beep beep\" later became the official version to match the theme song and sounds of the car horn on the Plymouth Roadrunner car.  \nThe \"Meep Meep\" Era \n\n    Origin: The phrase originated with Paul Julian, an animator for the cartoons. \n\nInspiration: Julian would say \"meep, meep\" to avoid bumping into colleagues in the studio. \nAdoption: His voice was recorded and sped up to become the Road Runner's iconic sound. \nPreference: Julian's preferred spelling was \"hmeep hmeep\" or \"mweep, mweep\". \n\nThe \"Beep Beep\" Era \n\n    Theme Song: The theme song, \"Beep Beep,\" solidified this sound as official. \n\nCar Inspiration: The phrase also mimicked the horn of the Plymouth Road Runner car from the 1960s. \nOfficial Status: \"Beep beep\" became the accepted catchphrase, even in official YouTube videos of the character.\"","createDate":"1757857078","updateDate":"1757932428","approveDate":"1757857079","recommendations":22,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144994354","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-14","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8927872776985168}

I remember once learning the money amount that was paid to WB for each car for rights to use the name and image.  It was a LOT of money.  Over the years, I owned a couple.  Their horns were definitely beep.  And the small images of the Roadrunner that were applied to the car had an even smaller copyright emblem at the bottom right.\n\nConsidering a previous poster mentioned that WB admitted the sound changed, I would have no problem believing that the sound matching the car was part of that very lucrative contract.  There's also the mandela thing - as popular as the cars were for a decade or so, I'd bet people heard the car sound much more than the cartoon.","createDate":"1757869217","updateDate":"1757929124","approveDate":"1757869219","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145000612","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-14","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.6129811406135559}

But he’s a Roadrunner and clearly the sound is meant to resemble a car on the road. Cars go BEEP in the US, you BEEP your horn and if a clue was “what sound a car horn makes”’ and the answer was MEEP people would say that was wrong.
