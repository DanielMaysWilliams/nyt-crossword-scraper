I'll add that WIDEBODY fits into 13A.

By the time I saw the revealer (ORS) at the very end, I had pretty much completed everything without any idea why those theme answers were right.  So I just filled in the last three or four answers I needed, and then, jingle having played, I finally stopped to take measure of what was happening.\n\nMoral of the story:  When you have a tricky puzzle where you have no idea why the theme answers are making no sense, just keep going.  Eventually, the revealer will show up to explain how it works.\n\nOne kvetch:  The word I know for \"happiness\" in Hebrew is \"simcha\" (שִׂמְחָה).

His go-to saying after he’s had to answer questions that the students would’ve answered themselves had they looked at the syllabus or done the assigned reading is: “Amazing [rhymes with whit] happens when you read.” \n\nDoesn’t it, though?\n\nOver all, not too easy, not too hard—just right for a Thursday. ERIEPA and ERNURSES just wouldn’t parse for me, and the penny took a minute to drop on the latter because I’ve never heard the term EARNED RUN. (Great clue there, btw.) SAMLET for young salmon was new for me (luckily inferable), as was SASSON (thank you, newsfeed brain, for offering up NED Lamont from your dark recesses). PALOMA will always be the name of a song by Chavela Vargas to me, but the cocktail sounds really tasty.

Try it sometime. What Simeon did on that front was impressive enough.\n\nBut what blows me away is that he came up with this idea in the first place.  How did he do that?  How did he go from blankness to THIS THEME?\n\nThat’s what Simeon regularly does.  He’s a brilliant inventor.  It’s why I did a little inner leap when I saw his name atop the puzzle today.\n\nSo, thank you, Simeon, once again, for a fun and satisfying solve, and for another opportunity to experience your remarkable talent.

You have to see why it was created in the first place.\n\nNormally, when a ball is popped up, the natural move is to catch it. The batter is out. This seems rather obvious, because that's a basic rule of baseball.\n\nIn the early days of baseball, someone clever realized that when there were fewer than two outs, and runners on first and second. or bases loaded,he could let the ball drop, and then get a double play. Since the runners could not run until the ball was caught, they were glued to their original bases.  \n\nBut once the ball hit the ground, they were subject to a force play. A quick-thinking infielder could throw the ball to third, and then to second before either runner could get there. (With bases loaded, there was a force at the plate, as well, so there could even be a triple play if there are no outs.)\n\nThe powers that be thought that this trick play made a travesty of the game. So they decided to make the infield fly rule to prevent it from happening.\n\nWhy no infield fly rule when there's only a man on first? After all, he and the batter are both subject to a force play. But the batter isn't stuck at home; he can run to first immediately, and would easily make it there. At best, the fielding team could just exchange one runner at first for another one.\n\nWhy no infield fly rule when there are two out?  Because there's no chance of a double play.\n\nLogical, isn't it?","createDate":"1750971139","updateDate":"1750980558","approveDate":"1750971140","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143125218,"parentUserDisplayName":"Monika Eckhart","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143127706","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8653813004493713}

For example, the batter might get a home run, or a hit or bunt with someone on third base who is then able to score.\n\nThe formula uses nine innings to find the average because that is the usual length of a game, but most pitchers do not pitch a full game. Perhaps most confusing, a pitcher can be \"responsible\" for runners still on base after he leaves the game, and can earn runs if those players score.","createDate":"1750971181","updateDate":"1750973656","approveDate":"1750971182","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143107660,"parentUserDisplayName":"Monika Eckhart","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143127723","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-26","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9159215688705444}
