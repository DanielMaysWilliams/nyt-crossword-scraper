I've heard of green and red berets, so why shouldn't there be gRaY RANGERS? (I did not fully understand the theme so I failed to spot M was missing). I have not heard of ORAL vaccines, so I kept staring at the _RoL I had there and feeling completely lost. Also, I was stumped by the \"stole from a show\" clue, especially with the wrong letter at the end. I had to resolve the resulting mess by checking the column.\n\nAs for BOA: Polish has the word \"stola\", which I think is related to the English \"stole\", but the meaning is slightly different. We have \"boa\" in Polish, too, but it's not a \"stola\". That word only means an ancient Roman gown and that thingie Catholic priests may wear over their shoulders.\n\nAnother problem spot was the crossing of the unfamiliar painkiller brand (crosses gave me ANA_IN) and the \"bulletin board sticker\" in the SW. I don't really know what a bulletin board is in English and I understood \"sticker\" as a thing you glue onto something, so with crosses giving me TA_K, I put an \"s\" there. I should have known better I guess. I looked up the drug in the end.\n\nThe theme was fine, but alas I wasn't observant enough to realize the answers used *only* letters from the themed countries. Doh.\n\nThere was so much trivia in the grid I was worried, initially.

This puzzle would have been tricky-funner without the IMPLICATION OF SHOUTING, say.\n\n***\n\nAnyone remember the Toledo War? As a former Ohioan/present Michigander, it is fresh in my memory! \n\nBy the fourth decade of the 19th c., it was clear that the Maumee River, and the port of Toledo on Lake Erie, was going to become vital to water transport from the Eastern Seaboard to the (then) Western Frontier. But who owned it? Basing their claims on differing geographic surveys, and specifically the southern most point of Lake Michigan, there was an ten mile wide strip of land, running from Lake Erie to the Indiana, and which included the mouth of the Maumee, which was claimed by both the State of Ohio and Michigan Territory.\n\nThe issue came to a head in 1835, by which point Michigan was suing for statehood. However, Ohio would not approve, unless Michigan ceded its claims to the Toledo Strip, as it came to be called. Arguments grew hot, to the point that Ohio and Michgian both stationed militias on opposing sides of the Maumee; and one boozy Sunday night, volleys of musket fire were shot into the air (the Battle of Phillips Corners). Luckily, there were no casualties.\n\nIn December of 1836, at the Frostbitten Convention in Ann Arbor, Michigan finally ceded its claims. As a consolation prize, it received the Upper Peninsula from Wisconsin Territory, which, at the time, was considered worthless, but became economically valuable once copper was discovered there in the 1840's","createDate":"1759320228","updateDate":"1759370668","approveDate":"1759320228","recommendations":9,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"145630840","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-10-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6074869632720947}

The roads are unsafe, if not impassable. Huge trucks will jackknife off the road, taking surrounding cars with them. Visibility is limited to a few feet, so it's easy to get lost, even on very short trips. The wind will strip away all your body heat and leave any exposed flesh frostbitten within less than a minute.

Pre-schoolers are not allowed to come without an accompanying adult until the year before they start school: age five.  All first-graders walk to school on their own, and biking is allowed after passing a test in the fourth grade.  When I go back to the U.S., I can't believe how restricted kids are. Of course, in Europe the streets are safer for pedestrians than in much of the U.S.  However, I do remember that when I was a kid in the 60s all schools had \"walkers\" and my own walk to the school bus stop was ten minutes on the gravel shoulder of a highway with a speed limit of 70.

If schools lose power that brings another huge safety and security concern regarding emergency communications.
