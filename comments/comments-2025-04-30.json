And chestnuts are in bloom - another sign of high spring. For decades the exam at the end of high school - \"matura\" (or \"egzamin dojrzałości\", maturity exam) - was organized over a few days at the beginning of May, just as the chestnuts were blooming: and it was a hard exam, so teenagers were stressed out by the sight of those otherwise beautiful flowers. My matura in the late 90s was one of the last on this traditional schedule. Then educational reform changed the exam timetable and contents, and the chestnuts started blooming in April.

I was on my bike, scouting yard sales one fine Saturday. I found some treasures that day! A pair of wooden shoes, a stove-top popcorn popper, and an old handmade quilt. I loaded these into my bike basket and headed for home. The bike was a little top heavy and tippy, but everything was secure.\n\nI took a shortcut down a dirt road and spied a big sale at an old farmhouse. What luck! I looked through plows and jars and old oak dressers, when I saw it, a mantle-top pendulum clock. What a beauty! Great condition, how could I pass it up? \n\nAfter paying a pittance for the clock, I loaded it on my bike. I nestled it in the blanket and secured the whole thing with bungee cords. Success! Off I rode, giddy from my bargain hunting prowess. As I biked down the drive, a chicken darted into my path. I braked, I swerved, and I toppled over, right into the manure pile. The chicken was safe, but I was a mess. The clock fell off the top and landed face first. I picked up my bike, reloaded my basket, and gingerly rescued my new clock from its odiferous environs. The glass was shattered, and the front of the clock was caked with manure. Pee-yoo!\n\n\"Well, I can get a new glass for this, and there's no other damage.

It is commonly used in discussions related to business, entrepreneurship, and strategic planning, where the timing of a move can greatly impact its success.
