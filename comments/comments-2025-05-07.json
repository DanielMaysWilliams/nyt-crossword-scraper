It costs a lot to change letterhead and signage, and plus, there were those revanchists eager to reclaim that lost \"h\" as if its loss were a mortal blow to their dignity and civic pride. Some refused to drop the H and continued to publish their newspapers and magazines with the H intact, which led to heated disputes, jabbing the air with their cigars, threats of caning, and stern rebukes in the editorials of those papers bereft of H who took their cues from the millionaire's row.

However, disastrous wars of the 17th century (with Russia, Sweden, Turkey, etc.) caused a great decline from which Poland never recovered.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, Poland's neighbors - Russia, Prussia and Austria - had engaged in the partition of Poland, taking away bits of the country.

Heroic the struggle may have been, but in reality it contributed to the ultimate downfall of the whole country. In the aftermath of the uprising, the final partition of Poland came in 1795 and the country disappeared from the world map for 123 years, to reemerge only in 1918 - us Polish people remain grateful to the US president Woodrow Wilson for his support of Polish independence at the time.","createDate":"1746627974","updateDate":"1746697468","approveDate":"1746627975","recommendations":26,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":141964131,"parentUserDisplayName":"David Connell","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"141966556","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-07","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7260770201683044}
