As a newish attorney, I had a high profile trial in federal court in New Jersey.  I did not meet the opposing trial attorney until the first day of trial because he had not been involved in the discovery process.  He was cocky, experienced and . . . pugnacious.  He took an immediate disliking to me, and took great offense at my objecting  to something he said during his opening statement. By the end of the day, he was steaming. After the jury and judge left the courtroom, he expressed his displeasure and said, “Go back to New York, you punk.”  When I responded in a way he did not like, his next words were, “Do you wanna go outside?”  This was in a federal court and the courtroom deputy was still present.  When I reminded him, incredulously, that we were supposed to be above such behavior, that only made him angrier.  Luckily, his associate (whom i had gotten to know and like during discovery) restrained him and they finally left. \n\nThat was day 1 of a three-week trial.  Needless to say, I was a bit shaken, but I managed to hold it together and justice prevailed.  By the end, we had become begrudgingly cordial.  A few months later, I received a call from a potential client.  When I asked how he had found me, he explained that the man who had recently wanted to beat me up had referred him.\n\nExtremely fun Monday.  123 rejections!  I have a tough time dealing with one.

These have dead-flat faces and generally have the shortest shafts of all the clubs.  The iron numbers go from one to nine with nine being the most lofted (e.g. shorted shafted and highest launch angle) and therefore will carry the ball the shortest distance.\n\nThe reason I asked about the nature of your question is that almost no one actually owns, let alone carries a one iron in their golf bag.  One irons have basically been replaced by specialty clubs that fall under the \"woods\" category which tend to be more forgiving and easier to hit well... so having a one iron in your bag would be very strange.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps... and/or... woosh...

It is also used to show how a player has done over several days on particular types of holes.  As in, “She is shooting even par on the par fives for the tournament”. \n\nSure, it is a bit redundant, but that is quite common (and even useful)  in spoken English.  \n\n Btw, “even par” is not used for a score on one hole.”  Maybe that was what you are referring to. One would just say,  “He shot par on number 14 today”. \n\nI do know of one place where the phrase “even par for the round” is never used.   The golf league I play in.

Some sample answers:\n\nBUTTHEBEST\nLEFTBEHIND\nUPMYSLEEVE\nLEFTBEHIND\n\nAnd finally, not on this topic, but a Sunday from March 25, 2007 by Fred Piscop with the title \"?OOH!?\".
