It was not just any old sculpture but one that Pliny himself extolled as one of the greatest works of art of his time.  It has been on display at The Vatican ever since. The sculpture depicts the Trojan philosopher & priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents. In the 18th century, a dispute between the German art critic Winckelman and the author Lessing regarding the expression of agony on Laocoon's face led to Lessing's composing \"Laocoon,\" an important essay in which the serpent becomes, for Lessing,  a complex metaphor for the constraints placed on artists and intellectuals. \n\nDon't get me started on The Princess Bride - the book AND the movie are both fantastic!\n\nHere's the sculpture:\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laoco\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laoco</a>ön#/media/File:Laocoön_and_his_sons_group.jpg\n\nAlso liked the smackdown in the constructor's notes.

Some things will never be funny or cute. I found this to be in very poor taste—as I would jokey references to the sites of more modern mass murders.

Ignorance on the Wounded Knee Massacre. It is clear that Native American culture and history are not a huge focus of mainstream education, and the victors are the ones whose stories are told. For the writer and editors, upon multiple reviews, to gloss over this clue, is alarming to me because ignorance would mean that Wounded Knee was not taught to any of you that no word associations appeared in your minds upon reading the clue.\n\n2. Know of/heard of Wounded Knee, but not understand the severity of it, or think that it could pass because the demographic of NYT Crossword may not be majorly consisted of people who would dissent. Have similar puns/semantic relations been made about other genocides (I won’t list them, I’m sure you all can think of examples of genocide throughout history)? And if they didn’t pass, why not?

One may take something and then hold it (or not). One may hold something having taken it (or not). But “to take” and “to hold” are not interchangeable objectively.\n\nI can only say at this point that the sole justification for this clue’s validity is that English speakers in practice will use the words interchangeably, with the real meaning implied only by context. And I do believe that in this and other crossword puzzles, that kind of usage does justify this clueing. I don’t like it. But, of course, that doesn’t happen to be a factor in crossword construction.
