But 5D had to be EMTS, so I changed it to DREAM, muttering the whole time, \"That's not what it's called.\" Then, just like Deb, finished the puzzle and Googled \"Is dream yoga the same as yoga nidra?\" and learned exactly what Deb learned. Nope. It's a different thing.\n\nTHIS IS WHY YOU DON'T COMPLAIN IN THE COMMENTS ABOUT AN ANSWER BEING WRONG WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING IT UP! \n\nBut now that I know what it is, I want to start practicing it!

You can make up the lines because none of it's real!\n\nThere were so many other fun answers that were totally on my wavelength.

Like Caitlin, I thought the latter was going to be yoga nidra, although I’ve heard of the Tibetan practice of dream yoga. I’ve been a kundalini practitioner since college, and my most memorable teacher tried to initiate me into some Tibetan rites but, to dream, one has to sleep first and, well, the latter has always been problematic for me. \n\nMOOD as clued crossed with MOCHI led to my having to leave the M square empty till I completed the remaining grid, then running the alphabet. There are two assumptions which come shining through in how both the NYT crossword puzzles and Spelling Bee are edited: (1) modern slang is ubiquitous and/or worth acquiring, and (2) everyone is or should be a foodie. I’d argue this is more of a culture-creating than culture-reflecting position, but I’d be a pretty lone voice. \n\nAron for ADAM held me up for a couple of minutes and briefly left me wondering why East of Eden would be clued as a movie instead of one of the finest example of our American literature. But then Virginia (or perhaps Leonard?) WOOLF came and went without a single work being cited. And so, true to form, the puzzle managed to avoid requiring the solver to have ever read anything resembling literature (with apologies to Emily TESH, but still). \n\nI liked the puzzle, by the way.
