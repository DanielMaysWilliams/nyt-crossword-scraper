I am not a linguist, nor an expert on grammatical terms, but I somehow suspect you might be. This happens quite frequently when experts in a field object to certain clues as technically inaccurate, when to a person on the street they may seem quite reasonable. It reminds me of when medical terms (my area) in the crossword are consistent with common lay usage, but inaccurate from a technically medical  point of view. E.g, “Possible sign of a headache” …BRAINTUMOR. Medical professionals will know that that would be a symptom, not at all a sign. When I studied Latin in high school, one of the TENSEs we were forced to memorize was the perfect TENSE (right DC ?). There is an entry in wiki under “Pertect” where the first line is, “The perfect tense or aspect,,,”,,,,technically you may be accurate, but in the wild, and in crosswords. I think the clue is okay. BTW, it has previously been used in clues or entries this way multiple times. E.g. 10/5/2019 , “Perfect and then some?”….TENSES.","createDate":"1714171045","updateDate":"1714234326","approveDate":"1714171049","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":132817987,"parentUserDisplayName":"Manhattan","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132824987","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-26","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.4994144141674042}
