Like girdles bring up the rear. A letter too short. Knickers works. Or maybe it's something like botox, way too short, but perhaps botoxins. Then there's silicons, which fits. The problem is they tend to bring OUT the rear, rather than UP.  Or maybe it's people who bring up \"the rear\" in conversation. Horses rear, so possibly an equestrian or a rodeo clown. Or a proctologist. Or those stripmall \"doctors\" who'll give you a Brazilian lift. They might bring it up in conversation. As would artisanal piano bench makers in Williamsburg. Oh well, go with caboose, what can you lose?\n\nJane Eyre, what a novel. What a role model in her way.

And that's when our lives did a 180. She became Ultra Orthodox after no religious upbringing, and I went the other way from one that was very religious. We lost contact over the ensuing decades, but reconnected on FB a couple of years ago. Just two weeks ago her adult daughter put a photo of her business card on her mom's FB page.It showed a woman's arm covered in a beautiful HENNA design, and I couldn't figure out why this Orthodox (but not Sephardic) young woman would be involved with HENNA.

Caboose comes last for several reasons. The crew is quartered there, and usually have a stove for warmth and cooking. From a raised box on the roof with windows on all sides, they can look out over the train and check for problems. From an open platform on the back they can signal to the rear. They have braking capability in order to assist with sudden stops.\nThe slang use for caboose to mean rear end is a simple adoption of the name of the car that literally brings up the rear. The clue is simply factual.\n\nIcons in Eastern churches are more than pictures, more than referring to saints and holy things. They are taken to be embodiments of those things, as such the icons themselves are objects of worship along with that which they embody. The word “iconic” is not meant to say “like a cute little picture on a computer screen”, but more “full of powerful presence.”","createDate":"1712318232","updateDate":"1712884287","approveDate":"1712323027","recommendations":27,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132335918","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-04-05","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7609068155288696}

This is one of those puzzles that makes me humbly remember that I've got a verrrrry long way to go before I'm actually good at doing crosswords. All I can say for myself is that I immediately knew SILENT DISCO. They had one at a gala I attended a few years ago. I didn't feel the need to participate but it was memorable sight to behold. \n\nI also immediately had UNO, JANE EYRE, and TIMOR, the latter of which I'm proud of because I know it from my geography game. I'd be way worse at the crosswords if I hadn't been doing that game for a year before trying out the crosswords. I waited on the always delicious NAAN because I sometimes get fooled with roti. \n\nEverything else I had on the first go was just wrong. If this puzzle was trying to stump this chump, it sure COMMIT(ted) TO THE BIT!  😏\n\nHopefully I'll remember some of the things I learned today, though, including the names of Game of Thrones characters, as one of the few people who took no interest in the books or show.
