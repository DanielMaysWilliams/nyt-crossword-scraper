Difficulty is certainly not the only metric by which to judge these things. \n\nI especially enjoyed 29 across; as Wednesday’s crossword taught us (60 across), the little bugs populating the rebus squares on Thursday’s crossword will “farm” today’s sap suckers for their honeydew! Obviously they don’t have udders, so the ants will stroke them with their antennae to stimulate honeydew excretion. \n\nI also enjoyed “literally grilled meat.” So often, a generic Spanish term is used in English to denote a very specific preparation or variety. Salsa is just “sauce,” queso is literally every “cheese,” sombrero is any old “hat,” and yes, carne asada literally means grilled meat. Which is fine — there’s good reason for that.

Not all that easy for me, of course, and I did have to look up a couple of things. But then it was just a lot of pondering and working the crosses until something finally dawned on me. Oh, and I'm about 15 miles west of our constructor's college. \n\nAn off-topic joke inspired by 47d. During my time in Vietnam we were in the far north and often not far from the border of LAOS. That led me to recall one funny moment. After a long day trekking through the jungle, we had camped for the night on a hilltop. When we got up the next morning, one of the guys looked out to the east and said, \"Oh, wow. You can see the gulf from here!\" And one other guy said, \"Really? Can you see Hue out there?\"\n\nTo which he replied... \"Oh yeah, way, way out there.\" \n\nSome interesting puzzle finds today, all with somewhat similar tricks.

I enjoy those even more than I do rebussesses.\n\nGolf-related clues are always chuckle-worthy . For the Golf course part… “woods” fit nicely, “water trap” did not. Water seems to have a magnetic quality on a golf course. It attracts geese, ducks, gators (in Fla) and the invasive Titelist. I do occasionally celebrate the ball landing on the first cut of rough on my approach shot, so not all is lost.

Even if the editors had perfect foresight and the trend line for every week went steadily upward, I know my own data points would be all over the place. There is no way I can judge a puzzle's place on some theoretically desirable weekly trend line by my own individual measure of its difficulty. And judging by comments in this space, this appears to be generally true--invariably when a bunch of people find a puzzle easy, others will find it unusually difficult. \n\nWe are not promised that the puzzles will get steadily harder for each one of us, or even for the solving public as an aggregate, but that they will _generally_ get harder as a week progresses.

Płatki (flakes) is what we call most cereals: płatki kukurydziane (cornflakes), płatki owsiane (the oat flakes you use for porrige). American-style cereal was practically unknown in Poland before democracy and market economy. We've been eat porrige for centuries though, obviously.

A long, long fight but we managed to drive them off. \n\nThe next morning, the three of us who were left in my squad spent a couple of hours with others going around and picking up bodies and putting them in cargo nets to be hauled back to the rear. When we were finally done, we sat down for our usual smoke break, and one of the other guys turned his pack on its side and read: \n\n\"Warning. Smoking may be hazardous to your health.\" \n\nAnd we all collapsed on the ground laughing.

More to the point, late-week puzzles often contain answers that are not what comes to most people’s minds first. \n\nThere have been a lot of new solvers to these puzzles, and the learning curve is slow. A classic example of this is the fact that seemingly half of the nitpicking today is about SPIDER SENSE. But if you look into it, that’s what it’s actually called by the cognoscenti (not claiming to be one, but I did a little Googling when that came up). Sure, most people know the other version of it, but it’s Friday, and the answer is likely not to be what you think of first. \n\nUnderstanding this is a key part of being able to do the higher difficulty puzzles. Griping about it, on the other hand, is counterproductive.","createDate":"1754079241","updateDate":"1754093732","approveDate":"1754079242","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143968924,"parentUserDisplayName":"Zach","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143971511","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6252686977386475}
