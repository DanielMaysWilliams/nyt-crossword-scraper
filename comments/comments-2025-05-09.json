I've never heard PASTA WATER called \"liquid gold\". HAW flakes were alien to me. I have no idea who Superboy and his crush LANA are. ADA is just one of those American abbreviations I can never remember - there are just so many of them! I'm familiar with many Hills, but not DRU. ONE AND DONE I came up with only with many crosses, and it's not a phrase I *know*. \n\nI didn't understand why READY OR NOT was clued with \"Seeking comment?\" Ok, I checked the column. Yeah, nah, that was not gettable for somebody who has never played hide and seek with Americans.\n\nWith word checks I filled the grid but... No blue star. Review did not help.

This approach could be intended to streamline the viewing experience, reducing clutter in threads with many nested responses. However, I understand this makes the VAR function appear inconsistent, especially since it used to show after 3 replies, and now it’s not triggering reliably.\n \nYour workaround of clicking the timestamp to display all replies, and the fact that emailed links show all replies, aligns with this explanation, the timestamp likely forces a full thread reload, including nested replies, while the email link bypasses the streamlined view. I’ve tested the thread you shared, and I can confirm the VAR button isn’t consistently appearing, which suggests a potential change in how we display replies.\n \nI'll note this ticket as feedback for our team to review and consider as we continue to look for future improvements for our solvers, thank you.","createDate":"1746791100","updateDate":"1746828289","approveDate":"1746791100","recommendations":15,"replyCount":5,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142011029","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-05-09","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.486187607049942}

In the US, crackers are a common vehicle for just about any kind of cheese. So much so that “cheese and crackers” is a common phrase. Probably most people in the US would think it odd to consume a hunk of cheese just by itself (unless it’s a cheese curd). Personally, I prefer my Brie on a thin slice of baguette, but a cracker will do in a pinch. I don’t doubt that there are many French culinary practices that other cultures would find degoutant. 😉\n\nPersonally, I thought the Red-handed clue was excellent, but you do have to know of the existence of the Cincinnati Reds to appreciate it, and more generally know a little about baseball. \n\nREADY OR NOT was also very clever IMO, but absolutely requires a cultural background that many outside the US likely wouldn’t have.\n\nI’m with y’all on the pasta water though.
