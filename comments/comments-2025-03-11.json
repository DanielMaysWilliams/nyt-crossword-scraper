According to xwstats.com, I finished 37.6% faster than usual for a Monday, but the puzzle was rated Hard.  However, xwstats went on to say that the breakdown of faster vs. slower than average was 49% to 51%. (Not sure how that comports with a rating of Hard.) The median solve time was only 1% slower. Also, 14% solved much faster (>20% faster), and 22% solved much slower (also >20%). \n\nThis bears out my theory that this was a puzzle that bifurcates distinctly between veteran solvers and newbies.  The comments add anecdotal evidence to support that theory.\n\nToday's puzzle, on the other hand, was considered Average, with a median solve time 15% faster than normal for Tuesday. Also, 79% of members solved faster (39% much faster) and 21% solved slower (7% much slower) than usual. My time, however, was 27.6% faster than my Tuesday average, and the two days' times were very much in line with the weekly progression (a ratio of approximately 15 to 16, without revealing actual times, which set a lot of people off!)\n\nWith a caveat that xwstats uses the solve times of only those who have signed up, you can still see patterns. Overall, it seems that Monday's puzzle falls in line with the usual progression, even though some had great difficulty with it.","createDate":"1741702340","updateDate":"1741719910","approveDate":"1741702341","recommendations":5,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140482266","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7787464261054993}

When working on a particular route, its called projecting. It was literally called a project. It's like doing Monday puzzles all the time until I can do it (I'm fairly new to crosswords). Sure the mountain is nature whereas puzzles are human-made, but with both, you learn a bit with each go. You get good at certain parts, find new toeholds or ways to \"solve\" the problem. Many routes do not call for a dyno, but I had to try that anyway because i could not reach the hold. There's no blame, just what my limited height (or limited exposure to some pronouns) brings. And yet, that entire route, while hard for me, could be \"easy\" for other climbers.\n\nThe point I'm making, as many are, is that there need not be a set-in-stone (no pun intended) formula for Mon, Tues etc. Perhaps there are hard Mondays and easy Tuesdays, without needing the puzzles to switch days. I see it more generally, where Mon-Tues will be, on the whole, easier than Thur-Fri.\n\nI got this Tuesday puzzle with greater ease than yesterday's but that's ok. I figured yesterday had a hard fill, but the theme was \"easy\" (last part of the entry is doubled). Today, maybe the theme was considered harder but the fill was easier. (That said, I've received acupuncture so that helped, but never heard of Little Lulu).\n\nAll in all, they were both fun, and will be easier than what's to come the rest of the week!","createDate":"1741724324","updateDate":"1741740108","approveDate":"1741724326","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140473884,"parentUserDisplayName":"Heidi","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140496804","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7032021284103394}

A palace generally does not feature any fortifications - much like Blenheim.\n\nThere may be some confusion, sometimes. A grand residential building within a castle may be called a palace - but the whole thing is still a castle. Also, in the 18th century wealthy Europeans fell in love with the historic style and they started building palaces made to look like castles. Neuschwanstein in Bavaria is a prime example. Those may be called castles, even if they are not, not really.\n\nFinally, it is most common to use the word \"castle\" for medieval and Renaissance structures, with towers and turrets and the like. Fortified palatial residences of the 16th-18th cent., made up of a palace surrounded by a bastion fortress, are sometimes called castles (like the Polish Krzy≈ºtop√≥r castle in Ujazd), but they may be called palaces just as well.\n\nYes, I'm into castles ;p","createDate":"1741717471","updateDate":"1741727176","approveDate":"1741717472","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140480140,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mean Old Lady","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140493214","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8393963575363159}

I interpret the stats a little different than you do, but not wholly. I completely agree that it shows Monday's was easy for the \"pro\" solvers and hard for us \"novice\" solvers. I also feel Tuesday's stats are the norm. Newer solvers tend to beat their average every week. 79% I would expect to be around the norm for a Monday or Tuesday especially since they have a higher number of newer solvers. Monday's was essentially, a 50/50 split. If half of the solvers out there are slower than average then it is indeed a hard puzzle. There are so many questions I have about what's behind the stats.

I would expect an absolutely MASSIVE selection effect from such a sample.\n\nFWIW, my speed Monday was significantly faster than my Monday average, bordering (6 seconds over) on a the time threshold that I would consider a particularly fast solve for me. Today‚Äôs solve was almost exactly at my Tuesday average - meaning significantly slower than my current (past year) average. I‚Äôve been solving for about 3 years now.\n\nWhile it was easier for me personally (based on my own areas of knowledge), Monday seemed like a more difficult puzzle in general (relative to the day of the week), borne out by the comments here - which of course also have a selection effect, but probably not as strong as you would see in the xwstats data.\n\nWith wordle-bot and connections-bot, it‚Äôs clear that the NYT collects a ton of data from its games app. While I wouldn‚Äôt expect a NYTxw-bot, I am surprised that the column doesn‚Äôt include a difficulty rating based on app solve times. It seems like it would be a very simple addition. There would still be selection effects, but probably much less pertinent to the general difficulty. It could even show a distribution of solve times so one could see if there was a bimodal distribution or the more expected Gaussian distribution.","createDate":"1741706241","updateDate":"1741738716","approveDate":"1741706243","recommendations":5,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140482266,"parentUserDisplayName":"Steve L","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140485492","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-11","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6362111568450928}
