So I made them T’s, which is apparently NOT what the instructions in the Wordplay column said to do. But then when it was complete and the music played, the T’s that I initially skipped over were gone. The TEA (T) LEAVES. So what? I skipped over them.

I can see why it was difficult to code, and I think a better solution would have been just blank shaded (or circled) squares that had to be left blank or maybe filled with a T. \n\nHaving a T in a square that could be written “under” was highly problematic.  I think the main problem was that when filling in an answer it was just so easy to accidentally type something in one of the T squares without meaning to, and then it was very difficult afterwards to see what (if anything) was in that square. And if you accidentally had some random letter in one of those squares, the puzzle would not complete, making fly-specking tricky.\n\nOverall I liked the gimmick though maybe not Thursday-worthy as presented, and I agree with others who have suggested clues that would have hinted at both words. The double-answers were all pretty good except for BAtE (at 3d) which I thought was not a common enough word for an unclued answer.","createDate":"1714653739","updateDate":"1714736711","approveDate":"1714653741","recommendations":9,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132946392","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-02","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.7858348488807678}

The guys on the ‘Fill Me In’ podcast might blow a gasket over the App interface in this one. So many varying experiences in what I read from others here, and mine was different still: \n- iPhone dark mode, and I saw faded circles as I solved. Got hung up quickly in the NE around the singer/sunken city, didn’t know the gimmick yet. \n- Then solved the hint clue in the SE and had the nice aha moment. I wasn’t sure if I needed to enter the Ts or not so I put them in only on that NE corner just to stop my forward/back buttons from stopping in those squares as I navigated. \n- At some point several minutes after that I left the app for a bit, and when I went back into the puzzle suddenly all the other Ts were all there in bold. Wha-huh? Was it because I solved the hint clue, and left and went back? Weird logic. \n- Anyway kept solving but ended up putting in Ts behind the existing Ts, again to aid in navigation not stopping there as I scrolled through clues. And the finish was declared correctly. \n\nBased on my experience and imagining the code behind this App, I’m guessing that people having issues where the app is not declaring a solve in some interfaces have accidentally entered a different letter behind one (or more) of the prefilled Ts… easy to do if there’s something blocking the square.","createDate":"1714663052","updateDate":"1714703882","approveDate":"1714663055","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132951529","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-02","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6096053719520569}

And now the  image switches. between T and blank just fine.","createDate":"1714690660","updateDate":"1714701769","approveDate":"1714690662","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132960480","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7080665826797485}
