But this was a breeze for me-- even though the clues were a bit harder than the usual Tuesday.  \n\nThe theme answers are unusually dense: Seven (7!!!) of them, although two of the titles are only 4-letters each.  The smoothness of the puzzle is enhanced by the fact that there's no  crosswordese and NO OTHER NAMES  in the grid (at least I don't think there are) other than the theme titles and the author.  That's always a cardinal rule for me: If your theme is built around proper names of one kind or another, leave them the bleep out of the rest of the grid.\n\nTribute puzzles can be boring -- but this one is kept pretty lively because of the fact that Toni's titles have a certain je ne sais quoi.

She's a generational superstar and although I'm not her target demographic, I can still enjoy her music.  That being said, I still have no idea what key any of her songs are in.\n\nBut I do know that the first two letters of the answer are IN, and the third letter, since there are only three (thus eliminating anything sharp, flat or minor), has to be one of seven letters, from A to G.\n\nSimilarly, Toni Morrison is a generational superstar in fiction.  Although I don't read much fiction these days, I know I read THE BLUEST EYE in grad school (around 1980) for a course in multicultural American literature, and I definitely recognize the other titles even though I didn't read the books.  I don't remember much about the one I did read other than that it was well worth it, and I'm amazed at how so many in what is supposedly such a cultured and literate group here profess ignorance (some proudly!) of Morrison's works and even of her existence.\n\nTwo of the other books I read for that course that I still remember 45 years later are The Woman Warrior by Maxine Hong Kingston, which was based on a legend that later became Disney's Mulan, and Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club.
