I sat on a horse (sitting was all it was) once, a long time ago, as a scared 9 year old boy on a trip to the Crimea, on a mountain overlooking Yalta. The horse was not terribly excited by the whole thing but it made no noises, whatever their names are. Does the specific silence caused by a lack of horse noises in particular also have an English name? To be fair, I know equally little equine terminology in Polish.\n\nAs has been the case almost every week for months now, I found this puzzle to be closer to my idea of Wednesday rather than Tuesday difficulty. I guess I am the one who keeps making these grids unnecessarily challenging. Today I made a silly mistake that took me several minutes to spot. I am not good with some animal names in English, so once I had _OLE for the burrowing rodent, I confidently entered M there. I'm not very good at medical procedures, for short, so I did not think about the cross much (I should have though, as the International Monetary Fund can't have had anything to do with pregnancies). I mean, I know a mOLE is not a rodent, but then again Sacha is not how Slavs spell the male name, even thought a NYT puzzle in September claimed we do.

I really liked \"Finger used to swear?\" for PINKY, very cute, and also the Tom Hanks clue for ALONE.  \n\nMost people think I'm very unreasonable about this but it still breaks my heart that Helen Hunt didn't wait for him (I know, I know) and instead married one of the very early on detectives from Dick WOLF's original Law and Order, Chris Noth.

The style went out of fashion in the early 20th century, but still lives on in American football uniforms, the occasional baseball uniform that is preferred by a small number of players (most wear long pants now) and horse racing jockeys.
