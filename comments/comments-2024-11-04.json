Up on a map is different from up in real life.  There are four cardinal directions on maps: north, south, east and west.  In real life, though, there are six:  the previous four, and up toward the heavens and down towards the center of the earth.\n\nIn that scenario, north is no more up than south is; in fact, unless you stipulate that you mean \"on a map\", no direction perpendicular to a standing person is up or down.  Only up and down are up and down.\n\n(On Sukkot, the Jewish holiday that just ended last week, observers shake the lulav and etrog--a group of various branches tied together and a citrus fruit--in six directions.  Eastward, southward, westward, northward, up and down.)\n\nInteresting, I once noticed that on star charts, east is to the left, and west is toward the right.

The downs there made no sense as a result, but I just woke up so it took a moment before I realized how to rectify the situation. It did not help that I was only familiar with the apparently British spelling of one of the downs, FURORe.\n\nSo yet again the American penchant for abbreviating words and the abundance of US acronyms was a source of confusion for poor Polish me 🤣. In everyday language we have exactly zero abbreviations for a dr/MD (we call an MD either \"doktor\" or \"lekarz\", which is related to the verb \"leczyć\", to heal. It does not mean \"healer\" though - that would be \"uzdrowiciel\", from \"uzdrowić\", a different, more miraculous and less scientific verb for healing). \n\nAlso, RN, EMT, IOU - some of the most common US acronyms in these puzzles, one of them used today - don't have Polish equivalents. A nurse is just a nurse, \"pielęgniarka\". EMT is \"ratownik medyczny\", literally medical rescuer. And IOU is \"skrypt dłużny\".\n\nIn general we use very few acronyms. The few common ones include AGD, artykuły gospodarstwa domowego, literally \"household items\", which we somewhat strangely use only for electric or electronic household devices: a chair or a rug, while definitely household items, are not covered by AGD.\n\nAbbreviations other than acronyms are used more often, but almost exclusively in slang.

In general, I find a double-créme cheese like brie still too firm to be scooped and spread (like a triple-crème, such as Saint-André might), but too flimsy to be sliced by the guest. But  pre-cutting it into bite-sized pieces will usually just devolve into a gooey mess once the board reaches room-temperature. And having a nice large wedge of brie, cross-supported by another wedge, adds a nice third dimension  touch to what is basically a two-dimensional construct. Or, as I say, \"who cares? Nobody eats this stuff anyway--it's just for show,\" as I munch a piece before throwing 90% of the left-over board into the trash (Happy note--we've recently begun a leftover charity donation program--not an easy task, given legal constraints.)\n\nIn general, for meat-n-cheese boards, I follow the 3-3-3 rule: at least three varieties of cured meat, three cheeses, and three sides like dried fruit, nuts, or olives. For cheese-only boards, the \"rule of five\"--five varieties, including one soft (like brie), one blue, and one goat- or sheeps-milk, for the cow's milk intolerant.\n\n* I am currently on medical leave--Hello, Wordplay!","createDate":"1730729830","updateDate":"1730754975","approveDate":"1730729834","recommendations":16,"replyCount":3,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"137326349","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-11-04","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.8044115304946899}
