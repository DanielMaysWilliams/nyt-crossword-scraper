Wikipedia tells us:\n\n“The term \"popemobile\" was first used in English-language media to refer to a custom-built Lincoln Continental used by Pope Paul VI during a pastoral visit to New York City in 1965. After the visit, the car was sold to Fort Dodge, Iowa eye doctor Eric Swanson, who promoted it as the \"Pope-Mobile\" and loaned it for other uses, including ticker-tape parades for the Apollo astronauts.”\n\nIt’s a pity Pontiac didn’t get in on the act.

But *I didn't find it that easy*.  We can say YMMV all we want, but apparently that's not really what we mean.  Many of the comments about this one are categorically vicious.\n\nFor example, I didn't know \"Echo\" was tied to \"Alexa\".  In fact, I don't even now know what Echo is, other than some stupid marketing name.  That was part of what made the SE very difficult for me.\n\nAnd you're right--the constructor is looking for feedback.  But feedback that the puzzle is childish isn't really feedback--it's brutal, destructive criticism.\n\nSo let me say this:  what is wrong with writing a criticism with just a bit of consideration for the work involved?  Why not a positive comment, a suggestion for something that wasn't so good, that sort of thing?\n\nI was Toastmasters, International, where people learn how to be comfortable giving presentations.  Every speech had an official \"evaluator\".  The terms of the evaluation were, 1) discuss what was good about the speech, and 2) suggest areas of improvement.  BOTH were essential ingredients.\n\nThat is absolutely not what is happening in *some* of these posts.\n\nAnd it makes me uncomfortable.","createDate":"1765434422","updateDate":"1765492843","approveDate":"1765462962","recommendations":6,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":147225698,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"147225767","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-12-11","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.8266427516937256}
