His predecessors, Will Weng and Eugene Maleska, had died, so he had no one to go to for advice. He began constructing puzzles based on what he knew as a former Games magazine editor. The regular Times solvers objected, saying the puzzles were for younger people and were too easy. “They wanted hard puzzles,” says Shortz, “so I thought, by God, if these solvers want hard puzzles I’ll show them how hard it is. I started making everything really hard, then got letters the other way. I then settled into a pattern where the difficulty would increase through the week.”\"\n\nThere was, in fact, a period of time when this progression was absent. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.law.virginia.edu/static/uvalawyer/html/alumni/uvalawyer/f05/shortz.htm\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.law.virginia.edu/static/uvalawyer/html/alumni/uvalawyer/f05/shortz.htm</a>","createDate":"1748788990","updateDate":"1748827132","approveDate":"1748788991","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":142516248,"parentUserDisplayName":"CaptainQuahog","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142518128","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7553824782371521}

On Sunday morning I'm not looking for that, I'm looking for relaxation along with fun mental exercise. For the same reason, I don't solve these as fast as I can.

This is not unusual in Thursday and Sunday NYT crosswords. Part of the puzzle is figuring out \"the trick.\"\n\nThe theme clues here are anagrams (words that can make different words when the letters are reordered). You can reorder the letters in the word EARTH to make a new word: HEART. So the first part of the answer to 39-Across, CHANGE OF [HEART], is another way of describing the process of resequencing the letters in the clue [EARTH]. We've CHANGEd the order of letters. \n\nIf and when that makes sense, now look at the other theme clues and answers and see how there's a similar relationship of doing something different to make something new.
