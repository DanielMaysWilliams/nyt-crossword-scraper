Oof. Spent some time on that corner. 3 decades of a vegetarian diet, yet INCOGMEATO and I had never crossed paths. I guess it doesn’t come in a can. And it sounds like it might taste as meat. \n\nThe COMPOST BIN resisted me for a bit, too. I wanted COMPOST bag. Tried composting once, I did. Filled a bowl with parings for a week while I waited for the weekend do we could go buy a COMPOST BIN. The weekend came; we got busy. So I kept adding parings and peelings and corings and pittings as I waited for another weekend to come. (Okay, fine, it was mostly coffee grounds. But some veggie parts went in, too.)\n\nThen, one misty PNW morning, I came down to the kitchen and— the contents of my proto-compost bowl had come alive. Grown new parts.  Definitely legs. Possibly teeth.
