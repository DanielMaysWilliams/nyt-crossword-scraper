I was hoping to enjoy a rebus, but alas!\n\nReading the NYT is bringing me down. Not because of them, they are simply doing their job, but because of all the terrors and threats the chump in chief is committing that bear reporting. Which trickles down to us up here, in the frozen Texas of Canada, with our leader trying to emulate said chump and encouraging xenophobia, dismantling of healthcare, censorship of books and more. And the big cities, as they do, votes left. So what does the right wing provincial government do? Cut funding to the cities. Now the cities, not wanting to be the bad guy, didn't increase taxes. No, they kept the tax the same, but just increased everyone's property assessment. Ours went up 170k (the assessment but not the value). Combine that with a shopaholic wife...\n\nSo I really needed today's crossword, a glass of wine, and a bath to myself. And it didn't disappoint. As a massive hockey fan, the islanders DYANSTY was a gimme (the Oilers lost their first cup final to them in 83 but beat them in 84). And paring that beside NUUUUUGE (Ryan Nugent Hopkins, the longest serving Oiler who's just played his 1000th game with the team) was *chef's kiss*. This cracked open the revealer and the whole puzzle.

I just know that green means go and red means stop, so I was translating the words as written. Of course, I do know where those colors appear on a traffic light, but the image wasn’t part of my solve. In any case, I think it’s a very big stretch to call this a rebus. Maybe if little images of traffic signals had replaced the words upon solving, I might yield a little in my opinion.","createDate":"1769093190","updateDate":"1769112500","approveDate":"1769093191","recommendations":1,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148266910,"parentUserDisplayName":"Heidi","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148269505","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-22","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.620615541934967}

Also I feel like the theme was spoon fed a bit. As soon as I saw the revealer (which was right away since it was an early down) I filled it in and immediately guessed to fill in RED and GREEN with stop and go in my mind. After that it was just like a themeless to me, and I found that decent enough but as I said there was some fill which could be off-putting. Also as someone else pointed out, the fact that GREEN and GO both start with G is a bit problematic. On the plus side I don’t see this mentioned but it’s a lot of theme to stuff in with 4 long theme entries and a long double revealer which had to intersect with the theme, which is a bit of a feat.

In crosswords, it’s when you have to cram more than one letter, or use numerals or symbols in certain squares. (You could also draw illustrations of those letter strings if they constitute real words, such as drawing stars in the rebus boxes if the string of letters is STAR.)\n\nOutside of crosswords, a rebus is a puzzle consisting of mostly pictures that must be parsed to make up a familiar word or phrase. The classic TV game show Concentration features those. \n\nThese two different phenomena were the only two types of rebus that existed. Until today, when Sam called today’s shenanigans a rebus, and a few people (although a minority) argued that maybe it is. \n\nIt isn’t.
