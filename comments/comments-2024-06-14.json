Enjoyed that clue.\n*\n\nOn the always-present “puzzle difficulty level” topic: I think the serious and long-time puzzlers who say fairly regularly here that puzzles are getting faster, have a strong point. \n\nI started solving (on iPad) about six years ago or so. I do the current puzzles daily, and don’t look up answers. I am not very fast. I am also working back through the archives, doing almost all Wed through Sun puzzles, and sometimes Mon and Tues. Currently in October 2015. For archives, I am willing but reluctant to consult Google. In the past six months or so, almost every “current” puzzle has been below my daily average time, and almost every archive puzzle is near or above it. Think about bell curves, and running averages as you consider these facts, not one puzzle, not even today’s. Also consider that 2015 was closer to my pop cultural sweet spot than is today (I’m “still 59” for the first time).\n\nI don’t personally mind that the puzzles are getting easier. But I would say there is good evidence that they are. And yeah, I enjoy some chewier ones. I would welcome a change to keep Fri and Sat a bit harder on average, such as that suggested below by Barry Ancona, or a similar idea.\n\nI hope to never be this long-winded again.

Almost unnoticed in such a stellar lineup. Words like TIMID and GAIT we just don't get often enough. And even the New York centric (dare I say \"insider baseball\"-!) shout-outs to STATEN Island and Joe TORRE brought a smile while solving.\n\nBecause I referenced Lewis, I'd like to point out a few additions to his post.

Terms used in clues seem pretty evenly divided among “brisk” to “moderate” to “easy” pace. “Home-run run” and “Race pace” have also been used.
