I've mimed hat-tipping many a time, but never thought about what it's called in English while doing it.\n\nSo yeah. I needed several lookups in the middle there.\n\nElsewhere in the puzzle it took me ages to get that many security guards may be ARMED - over here an extreme minority of them are: basically only the ones escorting huge amounts of money. I've never seen an armed security guard in another context in Poland. Gun crime over here is almost non-existent.\n\nHOUSE REDS reminded me how good it is to not be a wine snob.

Didn't know SCHUSS or OAS and was doggedly running the alphabet on those two (change a letter on one and then run the alphabet on the other. Change another letter on the first one and repeat.) But nothing was working. \n\nFinally, I realized my mistake was 30D. I had originally thought of DEtRItis, which obviously doesn't fit, but somehow I rationalized that maybe there was a short form of the word: DEtRIS. Yeah, that makes sense. Once I realized it should have been DEBRIS, there was much head slapping, and I could see that the second word of 38A had to be BEAST, which completed the squares I'd been working on.\n\nNever noticed SCRAG until someone mentioned it in a comment. I wouldn't have known that one either, but fortunately, I had filled in all the crosses in that section and didn't need to. \n\nFilled in APERTURE but didn't fully understand why until reading the column. I know what an aperture is and that it has to do with letting light into a camera, but I missed the wordplay with \"shower\" meaning one that shows.\n\nWished the clue for WHITE RUSSIANS had something to do with The Dude, but I can confirm that the clue is accurate, for me at least. Some folks say Kahlúa doesn't have enough caffeine to keep someone up.

Also, I loved your clue for 9A (SASHAY) that didn’t make the cut: Copy a working model, perhaps.\n\nTwo nostalgia twinges:\n\nCOIN PURSE: My father carried a plastic coin purse in his pocket, a small green oval that opened by pinching the two ends. If I needed a quarter or fifty cents (this was the 1960s, when that amount could buy lunch, or a movie ticket with snacks), he’d take out his purse, pinch it open then, before giving me a coin or two, regard them in a way that made me think he was assessing how nearer to ruin giving me that money might bring us. He was a doctor, so it  was likely an echo from the Depression…though I was the oldest of eight.\n\nThe second twinge came from your story about tea and crosswords with your grandmother. When I was 5, we lived briefly in Cleveland where my parents were from, while my father tried to figure out where to set up a practice; this was the late ‘50s, just after his discharge from the Navy, where he spent two years after his residency because of the doctor draft. I often some time with my grandmother when she had friends over for coffee and gossip. She’d sit me at the table with them, fill a china cup for me with milk, adding a smidge of coffee, and I’d sit, feeling quite mature, listening to chat about people I didn’t know.","createDate":"1749821532","updateDate":"1749863378","approveDate":"1749821532","recommendations":27,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"142820277","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-06-13","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9592043161392212}
