Sure, it’s easy to find words that become other words when you flip the first two letters, if they’re short.  Even in today’s puzzle there are non-theme words that do that – ACT, IRA, NOE, EMTS, USB, AWS, REN, ITT.\n\nBut try coming up with longer ones like Trenton did, i.e. RAMADA, COTILLION, OPTION, and GEOCENTRIC.  How did he do that?  Wow!\n\nThen he had to make phrases including those words, phrases that fit symmetry, that is, the seven theme answers had to include three pairs of entries, each with the same number of letters.  Double wow!\n\nAnd, for me, there was more to love.  Lovely answers (MIFF, ACCURSE, FINITE, ZOLAESQUE, MADAME TUSSAUDS, PERSIMMON), a sweet dook (REDANT), a TIL (HEAVE TO), and a rare-in-crosswords five-letter semordnilap (STRAP).\n\nI started this puzzle with a smile, Trenton, when I saw your name, and ended it the same way after a splendid outing.

According to my very limited search, sounds like there's a game called Jalopy that has crates in it... Or maybe the cars were called crates because they're dilapidated. Anyhow, if anyone cares to expound, I'd appreciate it. \n\nAnd apologies because I haven't looked through the comments yet to see if that got anyone else. I got it on the crosses, I just didn't understand it. \n\nFun! Now I have to get to work because I have a big deadline coming up before Thanksgiving,  and it's conch time! Ha!
