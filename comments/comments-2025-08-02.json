I used to love spinning Chuck Mangione records.

Listening to his live performance at Montreux in 1972 is a revelation.  Just a consummate musician, a maestro. \"Feels So Good\" I must have overplayed, overlistened to, until I got a little sick of it, especially since \"smooth jazz\" and me don't get along real well: I'm more a Monk-Trane guy.

Started by identifying every letter in the alphabet that can be rotated 180 degrees and still be legible: IOSHNX. Then I started with the premise that the word would likely be a mirror-image, that is, 1-2-3-2-1. After playing around with the letters, I wound up with S in the \"1\"-spots (S - - - S), because a verb ending in \"S,\" and a repeated \"S\" (since it's one of the most common letters) seemed likely. From there, a vowel (either \"I\" or \"O\") in the middle seemed likely, but I left \"SNINS\" in the blank to come back to later. Only when I got GRIME did I realize that \"M\" & \"W\" should have been included in my initial letter set, as I sort of \"exception\" for the \"1\" or \"2\"-spots! I've only been playing consistently for about a month, but, favorite clue ever! 😍\n\nI'm also finding that I ❤️ the XL spanners, which (for me/IMHO) feel impossible to get on a first pass, but come together so quickly with just a few correct crosses (& despite incorrect ones 😂), feel certain because of the letter count, and in turn help confirm so many crosses. Once I got the two spanners on the left, the whole puzzle snapped together.\n\n16a made me LOL FR: my first thought was \"extremely esoteric\"—\"flugelhorn player\"!?—but then when I got it I realized that I knew both the flugelhorn player AND the song from \"Megalomart\" commercials! 😂<a href=\"https://youtu.be/TFqp2Bcekwk?si=q7CFP2GiZoc-zBNN\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/TFqp2Bcekwk?si=q7CFP2GiZoc-zBNN</a>\n\nDidn't love TWEENIES. 😂 But thanks again for 37a! 😍","createDate":"1754146284","updateDate":"1754171145","approveDate":"1754146285","recommendations":7,"replyCount":4,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143986472","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.891287088394165}

I too loved Chuck Mangione. Back in the day I played the flugelhorn in the Wisconsin Marching Band as I didn't want to carry a French horn which was my serious instrument at the time. For the many who asked me \"what's a flugelhorn?\" my go-to reply was \"the horn that Chuck Mangione plays,\" which brought instant recognition as he was big in popular music at the time. The flugelhorn plays the same range and fingerings as the B flat trumpet, but its notably mellower tone comes from the fact that the bore of the instrument increases steadily from the valves to the bell, whereas the trumpet has a bore which remains more or less the same diameter from the mouthpiece to the point at which the bell's flare begins.","createDate":"1754159244","updateDate":"1754178046","approveDate":"1754159244","recommendations":3,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":143978673,"parentUserDisplayName":"Mike","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143991676","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-08-02","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.696562647819519}

Though the title suggests at least soft core porn, it is actually a remarkable movie, with Bruce Greenwood and Elias Koteas.  Very mysterious and ephemeral, with an Atom Egoyan gut punch at the end.\n\nAnyway, that movie used Cohen's song \"Everybody Knows\", and I was transfixed by it.  The words so dark and mysterious and poetic, with a voice that rumbled so beautifully.\n\nI mentioned it to a friend who knew about popular culture, and he said it was Leonard Cohen.
