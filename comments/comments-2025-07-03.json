(For context, I love and excel at most word puzzles, my husband and I play Scrabble TO THE DEATH, and I'm a librarian.)  I reluctantly tried a NYT crossword about three months ago, and while I won't say I'm hooked - well, yes, I will say that.  Why lie?\n\nHowever, I admit I've been skeptical of commenters who claim to love the tricky Thursday puzzle.  They're like people who say they adore kale and actively enjoy early morning uphill trail runs.  Like, sure, maaaybe those people exist, but are we maybe just bragging for the internet?\n\nWell, I stand corrected.  It turns out that when you figure out the trick on the first clue, instead of completing the puzzle in a fog of angry confusion, reading the column, perusing the comments, and then squinting at the completed puzzle and saying \"OK, I guess I can sort of see that\", it's a lot of fun.  Today's was my fastest Thursday puzzle yet, at almost exactly half my average time.\n\nSee you bright and early on the trail!  (Forget about the kale, though.  I still don't believe those people.)","createDate":"1751554312","updateDate":"1751631321","approveDate":"1751554313","recommendations":58,"replyCount":12,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"143273739","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-07-03","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.5232872366905212}

It reminded me of when I bought my beautifully cute bright orange car a few years ago and I was talking on the phone to my mother, hands-free, when I had to turn on my blinker, as all good people do when they're going to turn or change lanes...  Mom suddenly exclaimed, \"Honey, what's that sound!?\" She's seriously sounded panicked. I'm like, what sound? My mother's little high strung, to say the least, but she seriously thought it was a bom-b. I'm not sure what kind of life she thinks I'm living up in Minnesota, but the likelihood of my car being secretly bom-bed is pretty low, I'd say.
