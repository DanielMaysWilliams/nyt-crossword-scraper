The really ancient land of Biainili was known to its Assyrian neighbors as Urartu. Scriptural Hebrew made no provision for written vowels, so Urartu was rendered as RRT. When the Masoretic scholars invented vowel points centuries later, nobody remembered how RRT was originally pronounced, and the vowel A was arbitrarily inserted in front of each consonant.

In fact, I don't think they were. Yes, plenty of people who were stumped, and of course those folks complained, or recommended your comment. But thousands of solvers got them without any trouble and didn't give it a second thought.\n\nMy theory is that there have been a flood of new subscribers with unrealistic expectations about the difficulty level. Originally, the crossword was written for those who bought--and read--the rest of the paper. Now that there are Games only subscribers, there are many solvers out there who find these puzzles too tough, to the point that veteran solvers believe the puzzles are being dumbed down for the newcomers. I'm not sure they're wrong.  \n\nAs for recommendations, I've learned that it's impossible to guess why comments get reccos here. Lame dad jokes regularly get a slew of them, while well-reasoned serious comments often don't. I had the top comment two straight days last week, and I still have no idea why that happened. Don't ever believe that people agreeing with you makes it right. Everyone agreed those Salem women were witches.","createDate":"1741633758","updateDate":"1741646270","approveDate":"1741633760","recommendations":4,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":140457188,"parentUserDisplayName":"Kachi","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"140459971","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-03-10","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.6978377103805542}

A lot of new people have unreasonable expectations relative to what puzzles have been since Will Shortz felt his way into his groove somewhere in the mid-90s; in fact, since its inception, the puzzle is aimed at the typical NYT reader, not anyone anywhere. \n\nTo be good at crosswords, you have to be aware of the world around you and the world that came before you, with especial attention paid to things that don’t naturally interest you. \n\nA lot of new solvers are less cognizant of stuff from all walks of life, from the classics to current pop culture. And often they blame the puzzle for what they can’t solve. \n\nOn the other hand, many experienced solvers don’t like that the NYT may be capitulating to a crowd who whines when they don’t know stuff that has been in the puzzle over and over again. \n\nSo it depends on whose definition of “common knowledge” you go with. \n\nI think you also missed my point about the Salem witch trials. Just because a lot of people agree doesn’t mean it’s right. I could have also said geocentric theory or flat earth.
