The puzzle didn't *feel* easy yet I solved it in near record time. It would have been harder had I not remembered BATIK from a previous NYT grid 🙂\n\nOne entry today reminded me of when I used to travel around Europe with my parents in the 1990s. Since Polish prosperity at the time did not match Western European levels, we had to stay at campsites - it was all we could afford. Germans love camping and back then they issued a guide to all European campsites. It described the facilities, and the level of comfort. There were also other designations, which we did not understand. Travelling in Germany, we looked in the guide and saw a very highly rated yet affordable campsite on our route. It was designated as FKK, which was explained in the legend only in German: Freikörperkultur. We did not understand what that might be.\n\nSo, we arrived at the campsite, nestled in the hills of the German countryside, in a truly idyllic spot. It was at the end of a long drive, and surrounded by a 3 m hedge. At first my attention was focused on a very nice Jaguar parked in the entrance area. Then I heard a sound of surprise from my mother. I looked around and saw loads of naked people walking around. It was quite surreal.\n\nWe learned FKK is the German NUDIST movement, and they have their own campsites.\nIt's considered rude to wear any clothes there. My mother wanted to stay the night in the buff (she was quite free spirited), but friends we traveled with wouldn't hear of it 🤣.","createDate":"1756705104","updateDate":"1756785924","approveDate":"1756705106","recommendations":55,"replyCount":7,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144673636","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.7670992016792297}

She was gray haired, smelled of talcum powder, had an eye you avoided because it avoided you, and always said things like \"I've been rich and I've been poor, and believe me, rich is better!\" She lived in one of the famous hotels downtown, and worked as an editor in the desk next to mine on a top trade magazine in NYC. She, like most office mates, talked about what went on in her daily life, but never her past life. We knew she had a male friend, was and had always been unmarried, and had been friends with our chief editor for many years. That's all we knew. \n\nFast forward to the next century, and the whole world is Googling people they used to know. And there she is... with her own Wikipedia page...Natalie Marcin. Writer of the original Anchors Aweigh. She had been invited to California to watch as they filmed her story, but her parents felt she was too young. And yes, she had been rich.

This version emphasizes Greeley's impatience and the correspondent's witty reply.\n\nContext: Greeley's influence on journalism was immense, and such stories about his eccentricities and high standards would have become part of journalistic lore.","createDate":"1756741455","updateDate":"1756777027","approveDate":"1756741456","recommendations":8,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":144679824,"parentUserDisplayName":"RozzieGrandma","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"144680720","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-09-01","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.9012225270271301}
