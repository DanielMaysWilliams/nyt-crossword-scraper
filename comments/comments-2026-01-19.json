Are you solving on the NYT app?

We live in the last type.  \n\nOne of the apartment buildings has a parking lot and garage with chargers in every space, but those spaces are assigned to specific people.  Of course, the vast majority don't need the chargers, so their installation was a complete waste.  Another building has a smattering of them, but I assume enough to assign those spaces on the basis of need.  \n\nThere are two public chargers in one of the lots that are available to everyone. When I first bought the car, I decided to try one out and see how it worked.  It turns out it was priced prohibitively expensively, and not especially fast.  \n\nSo I started plugging the car into my regular outdoor outlet while mulling over my next step.  I knew I would probably install a charger in my garage, but it cost about $2000 to buy and pay an electrician to install.\n\nIt took about three days to fully charge the car using a regular outlet.  Although it was sufficient for my normal usage most of the time, I gave in and bought the charger.\n\nPeople told me that the electricity I used charging at home would barely cause my power bill to go up, and they were right.  And it gives a full charge overnight.\n\nOn the road, charging is not free, although a couple of hotels we stayed at did have it available free as an amenity.","createDate":"1768828228","updateDate":"1768857806","approveDate":"1768828229","recommendations":2,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148175544,"parentUserDisplayName":"Philly Carey","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148179013","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-19","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7296907901763916}

Added to the tumoil there were paid agitators and just people who  hurled rocks to break windows,  taunted the big guys in blue, thrilled by the idea of starting a riot.  \n\nOnce, there was a sweep of our downtown area (Berkeley is pretty small), when they herded scores into a parking lot,some of whom were on meds, diabetics, students, faculty, women who were shopping, business men on their way to meetings, then loaded them on buses and drove them to an out-of-town jail, where they kept them overnight, all to crush support for the demonstrations. . \n\nOne morning I saw a mob of cops on the street below our office window drag a young man to the sidewalk and form a screen to hide that they were beating him. I screamed that I could see what they were doing.  They didn't care.\n\nIt was more of a dress rehearsal for what we have now than child's play.  In the end, it didn't work then and it must not work now.","createDate":"1768847996","updateDate":"1768900438","approveDate":"1768847997","recommendations":7,"replyCount":0,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":148175679,"parentUserDisplayName":"Francis","depth":2,"commentType":"userReply","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"148186209","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2026-01-19","sentimentLabel":"negative","sentimentScore":0.5262357592582703}

A square in the cenyer of town was full of food trucks. One of them flew the Venezuelan flag, which caught our attention. They served arepas! \"It's the thing from the crosswords!\" I called out to my wife, \"we have to try it!\"\n\nThe lovely owners served us delicious flatbreads stuffed with some of the best meat stew I've ever had in my life - juicy, tender, aromatic.
