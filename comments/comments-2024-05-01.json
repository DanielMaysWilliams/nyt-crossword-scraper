My grandma was a gardener and would always drag me to work with her when the weather decided it was a good gardening day. As a kid I would grumble, wanting to go play with my friends. As an adult, I cherish those memories. \n\nThankfully I got 1A and 8A immediately so when I came to the revealer, I had an instant ah ha! moment. \n\nAs a science teacher I don't use very many VIALS but I figured it out quickly when beakers and flasks wouldn't fit and tubes didn't make sense with my crosses. \n\nI appreciated the familiar KARMA to help with 32A's starting letter because music pop-culture and history is not my forte. However, the angry comment crew from Sunday helped me with SOL, which would have been lost on me without the music context. \n\nThis is also one of the few Wednesdays I've been able to solve at all and I think I only had THREE lookups. Practice makes improvement.","createDate":"1714540532","updateDate":"1718241284","approveDate":"1714540535","recommendations":19,"replyCount":1,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"132913508","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2024-05-01","sentimentLabel":"positive","sentimentScore":0.9035349488258362}

I hope I can help people break free from their binary thinking on ‚Äúso‚Äù vs ‚Äúsol.‚Äù It‚Äôs not one or the other. It‚Äôs both, and, plus. As my colleagues in international music societies often have to remind one another, it‚Äôs just a tool, it‚Äôs not the Bible, and though I don‚Äôt subscribe to the theology implied, I do agree with the point. It‚Äôs a tool and not the culminating goal. Music is the goal. Here‚Äôs the thing. The creation of the solfege system is credited to a monk named Guido. Guido d‚ÄôArezzo, one thousand years ago. He took a hymn, Ut Queant Laxis, and used the text as a mnemonic, using the beginnings of words in the text. The relevant words: Ut, resonare, mira, famuli, labii. Or ut, re, mi, fa, sol (why not so?), la. There was no ‚Äúti.‚Äù Someone else had to come up with that. Someone else also had to come up with syllables to represent the chromatic tones. There are lots of variations depending on whom you ask. The relevant point, all of it is a tool box of mnemonics with the ultimate goal of being able to read music and sing it in tune. In some people‚Äôs tool box, si is used instead of ti to represent the leading tone to the tonic in major tonality.
