Sure, Gynaikeia, the text on women’s ailments, laid the groundwork for women’s health as a specialized field in the Western tradition. Sure, its idea of a “wandering womb” wasn’t new: there are Egyptian papyri from the 18th c. BCE discussing the same physical phenomenon. Sure, who could have predicted that once the Christian tradition rolled around, the Greek “of the womb” (hysterikos) would become what we now think of as hysterics—anything from demonic possession (thanks, Galen) to a medical diagnosis (thanks, Freud) to the slurring insult from a drunk guy at a junket last year whom I calmly told to get his hand off me. \n\nBut fighting a migraine and ambivalent toward the Greeks, I leave you with this from Gynaikeia:\n\n“When the womb moves toward the head and remains there, suffocation occurs, and the head becomes heavy; other symptoms may also arise, some on one side, some on the other. The sign is this: the woman feels pain in the veins of the nostrils and under the eyes; there is drowsiness and frothing at the mouth when the condition improves. In such a case (…) eat cabbage and drink cabbage water.”\n\nI’ll take a triptan instead (thanks anyway, Hippocrates) and wait till somnolence which does, in fact,  signal the end of a migraine overtakes me. \n\nHere’s hoping I don’t froth at the mouth, too.","createDate":"1736166932","updateDate":"1736211822","approveDate":"1736166936","recommendations":15,"replyCount":8,"editorsSelection":false,"parentID":null,"parentUserDisplayName":null,"depth":1,"commentType":"comment","trusted":0,"recommendedFlag":0,"permID":"138780147","isAnonymous":false,"puzzleDate":"2025-01-06","sentimentLabel":"neutral","sentimentScore":0.7600513100624084}
